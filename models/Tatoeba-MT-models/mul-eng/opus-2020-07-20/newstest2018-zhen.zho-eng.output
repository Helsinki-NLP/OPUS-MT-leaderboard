Civil Rights Group issued a travel warning against the state of Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state of Missouri, the American Association of Colored Persons (NAACP) has issued a travel warning to a group of colored people who are ready to travel to the state of Missouri.
"NACP, which entered into force on 28 August 2017, called for special attention and special attention to the attitude of all African-American tourists, tourists and people in Missouri when travelling in Missouri, especially as a result of a series of suspicious racial events in the recent state of Missouri," the group declared.
NAACP noted that the recent laws of a state of Missouri made it more difficult for people to win discrimination proceedings, and that the State law was also at a certain level directed at minorities, which led to the publication of travel warnings to the organization.
The violation of civil rights is taking place on people.
They were beaten or killed because of the color of the car, "The Kansas City Star, NaaCP President of Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
"We've received a lot of complaints, and there's no previous number."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization in the United States against a State.
The organization called upon the University of Missouri to address the genocide of black students and the deaths of the 28-year-old black man, Toli Sandes, in Tennessee.
This year, Sandes died in a suspicious situation, while he spent fuel on a trip to the state of Missouri and was detained by the police in the state of Missouri without charge of crime.
A recent report by the Office of the Attorney-General of the State of Missouri also indicated that "the possibility of a stop-up of 75 per cent in the country's black drivers is higher than that of white people".
Chapel said: "This advice is to raise awareness of people and to warn their families and friends and colleagues about what might happen in the state of Missouri. "
"People need to be prepared whether they take the security money to the state of Missouri or let their relatives know that they are traveling in the state."
According to the latest data from the Federal Investigation Board ' s hate reporting plan, the State of Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime level, the State was ranked nationally.
Travel alerts are also a response to the new laws of the state of Missouri, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the United States had adopted immigration law law and requested that the local law enforcement sector detain migrant offenders, the United States Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicate that this event would increase the number of racial proceedings and have issued travel advice for the state of Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Government of the United States to other countries, but the Advisory Group has recently taken this approach to address certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the "Golden Age" increased in 2015, the entire film market entered into a calm period in 2016, and the overall success of the last year of $440.69 million was a reminder.
According to data published by the National Statistical Office, in October the new and double-bedroom prices in Beijing fell double, with only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.
The current Chief Technical Officer of the European Union, Lupesko, made a technical report at this Conference on the 2016 Euro season and the last Euro Championship.
BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city in the world.
Referring to the news network on 18 January, British media reported that Beijing may have a 3,000-year-long history, but it is also rapidly becoming a modern attractive city today.
The capital of China has high-speed Internet access, which is one of the most exciting cities in the area of human wisdom, which is one of the most exciting cities for foreign people who have access to the spirit.
According to the British Broadcasting Company website, on 16 January, German journalist Clemens Seshi said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed wherever I can afterwards.
"If Sinatra lives today, he would probably sing a city like Beijing." He said that living in this city would make you feel like living in a new age," he said.
The elderly live in England, but recently in Beijing, Simon Newton published an article on the 4Corners7Seas blog website: "People generally feel at some large object centre, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become, and wish to see it. "
It is reported that the high quality of the city's Internet and the environment of technology friendly are making daily life easier than ever before.
From Manila, Andy Penya Fuert, currently a Deputy General of the Beijing Children website, said: "Bekin is rapidly becoming a cashless society, and the Internet is integrating traditional money packages into smart phones to make it easier for everyone to make many transactions."
It is reported, however, that the smart phone is only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition, and the field identification software has become widely known, and many mobile applications are using this technology for bank transfer and payment, which allows people to enter the apartment and office and even use it to verify the identity of the railway driver.
Beijing has recently announced that it will contribute to the construction of a human engineering technology park of 138 billion people, which will result in 400 enterprises falling there, focusing on the development of various human engineering technologies that are designed from biodesign to automobiles.
Food is also at the heart of many important days of China's history, participating in these celebrations being promoted by foreigners, the most important social and economic holidays and one of the most easily attended by foreigners.
She says: "I suggest that I help Chinese friends prepare for the past year to clean up their apartment and write a new year's bungalow on the door. All family members are going to have a great meal on Friday, and then stay late for the night, and get a fresh start for the new year. For foreigners, it is a real opportunity to be included tonight with friends and family."
While the number of foreigners in Beijing is growing and growing, the language barriers of China and the exchange between foreigners are reported to be easy to make it easy for them to fully integrate into local culture.
She says: "Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but their host country has little experience.
In these so-called "old external bubbles" (the "old external bubble" refers to foreigners only among foreigners, but not to local and local cultures — translators' notes), foreigners gathered in their communities, ate in the Western restaurant, and there were only foreigners in friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little bit more simple words -- that's easier than people might think.
She said: " The radio broadcasts in Chinese private schools every two hours each week should be suitable for each person's busy schedule. "
The short words of study are also helpful in buying, preparing meals at the restaurant, or driving out a rental car.
It is reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years governments have tried to overcome some problems.
Residents emphasized that it was important to go out to the outdoor activities in the often cold months of pollution to make those days as an opportunity for a long-standing fungus or for the search for an acceptable day-to-day park.
Noton said: "Becky is the most important city in China on the surface, where you can find good art and music activities, a comfortable night's life, a history, a more modern business area and an old neighborhood."
The report notes that ageing is increasingly evident in the role of obstacles to human capital growth, particularly in the north-east region, with an annual contribution to human capital growth of 1.28 per cent.
It has been noted with success that the risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled and that the basic factors for the international balance of income balance remain long.

The EU Commission claims that this year, in April of this year, the KOKO forced cell operator is not allowed to use other KOKO applications for software such as the search for KOKO and the Chrome browser.
The EU Commission considers this to be harmful to consumers' interests and impedes competition.
The EU regulators first asked Kung to respond before 27 July.
If the names of the offenders are rejected, the highest number of Kong will face 10 per cent of its worldwide collection of fines, amounting to approximately $74 million.
Kong has not yet been evaluated.
Hong Kong also faces EU investigations in favour of its own procurement services in search of results.
The remains of the cave are real, and it can be said that he's not an accident to achieve the "stepping" level from the country to the country, and the extent of his flying is still surprising.
Look at a picture: The legal status of the Beitung in all parts of the world.
Summary: In addition to the price recovery caused by the natural nature of the pollutant, this round of currency fluctuations also have nothing to do with the "neighbor" — the regulatory risk.
From the perspective of the visualization map, the attitude of the countries of the East towards the Pitts currency is more secure than that of the West, and the countries that are the subject of the global theme are still looking at the legality of the digital currency, representing the "black sun risks" which are still high.

With China, Korea and the EU's major market regulatory storm, such as by-circuit, the global currency that became the leading currency has been wiped out since this week, the price of two billion dollars per week has fallen, and the maximum day has been reduced since the creation of three years.
In addition to the price recovery caused by the natural nature of the investment, this round of currency fluctuations also have nothing to do with the "accommodation" — regulation risk.
In this important context, the HowMuch.net web site has developed a map showing the legal status and degree of control of the Beitung in the global countries.
As shown in the following picture, the green representative of the legal market in Bitumen; the green representative of the middle market of the Red Sea; the Green Representative of the Central Bank; the fact that there is no open legalization of the position of the bet; the limited market of the green representative; the local government tries to use the currency by means of the Red Line policy or regulation; the deep-white representative of the Pittton is defined as an illegal country; and the gray is a country that has not yet been evaluated.
(Image from HowMuch.Net Visualization Team on 15 January)
The article noted that from the green distribution of the map, the traditional Eastern countries were more conservative than the Western.
Russia is now the largest country to be defined as the illegal one, China is one of the largest limited markets in the world, India is still not being assessed for the same currency and not one of the largest countries in the relevant policy.
North America and Western Europe are the highest acceptance areas, that is, the distribution of green coins is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America have been clearly differentiated from the byte currency, and the color divides in the above areas are more complex.
Among them are Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil, which are legitimate by-product markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bolivia, with some restrictions on their trade and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet voted against.
The aggregate data above can be found that in 146 countries of global statistics, there are 99 countries (or over 40 per cent) that are subject to trade and use without restriction in terms of green and yellow.
There are seven countries (or 3 per cent) with limited markets (red) and 10 countries (or 4 per cent) have defined as illegal (deep) currency, and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) have no further treatment of digital currency information (green).
This indicates that countries with a global theme (53 per cent and more than half) are still looking at the legitimacy of the digital currency in the country, which is the leading currency, and represents the "black-day risk" of bitumen, as some of which might eventually make a legislative decision to limit the currency.
The article considers that the global regulatory body has not yet fully understood this new category of digital currency, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet acted.
Although the "human atmosphere" of the Byte currency has been indicative of growth since last year and is not of interest to all countries, some countries may be concerned about the threat of local currency because of the threat or even more concern about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street news has been detailed in detail in the international regulatory press for Bitwim since last week, including China's launch of central services to combat foreign trade on the online platform and the mobile app, and the Republic of Korea is still considering closing the digital currency transaction, and the EU believes that the Beitmour has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "corresponding to bloodless".
The Wall Street Information Editor "Read more about 2018: Global Mother opened the currency year?" She pointed out, from the regulation, accepted/critically adopted, that 2018 would become the global currency year.
The practice of countries such as Russia criticises the legal status of the currency, in fact, in order to send a digital currency to the public.
On 8 January, New York City, journalist Che wise, described the first time in New Caledonia's New South American style of wearing a baseball suit in Nokamp.
Kutino adopted the physical examination of Basa on that morning and signed a contract with the President of Basa Batomeu in 2023.
And then he was a baseball player, and there were about 7,000 volleyballs in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, the total contribution of Cutinio or up to €16 billion (about €7.77 million) was the first price of the Basa Club and Western History.
Since Kutino was still in pain, he had to rest for nearly 20 days until he was able to get his own son to wash his own bassa ball.
What else is the sacred thing?
The White House of Trenmphus is now in the hands of a free goddess.
The most sure sign of the regime was when they started attacking the image.
The United States and anyone agree to this. So, in 2003, Saddam? Zhao-sai of Baghdad's Sky Square was shaken by careful planning.
Stephen Miller, one of the key wisdoms of the government of Tranmp, was in a heated debate with Jim Acosta of the U.S. online television news network (CNN), about the president's proposal to restrict strictly legitimate migrants, and he was certain of what would happen in his own case to be a symbolism of the free woman's image.
Honestly, Miller didn't attack himself.
If he did, then a group of ship owners and followers of liberalism would have made him alive.
But he actually attacked the meaning of the painting, especially in 1903 when the famous song of Lazarus was immediately built on the base (this monument was built 17 years later).
As Miler criticizes Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but it's like a symbol of the United States of freedom and light of the world....
That one you're referring to, it's later added, not part of the original free goddess."
Actually, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This relates to the modern response to the voice of Lazarus ’ death. The only country seems to invite not only any elderly immigrants but also the poorest of the poor: "Your poverty, your poverty, or the people of your working group wish to breathe freely, and/or sufferers refuse the sea you own. "
There's no "depressed people" going to be more attractive on our screen.
Miller had not been involved in his technical comment, and he clearly indicated that these people would not be welcomed by the United States of America in the Tranquo era.
Such conflict on the meaning of the symbolism is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus (Lazarus), as well as hers, was actively taking part in the activities of her friends on the ground following her death, evidently knowing that their participation was highly political.
The purpose of this poem is to express the link between France and the United States of America through the old tradition of female genital mutilation.
Lazarus changed his meaning: In her neck, the woman's image is no longer reflected, and she's crying.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of the deceased.
It is a successful women's political change and a destructive fight against Native U.S.
Like Lazarus's change of image, the right-wing man has always wanted to change it.
Rush Limbaugh (Rush Limbaugh) is a former contemporary painter who, in 2010, felt that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and he is now an early preserver to bring the U.S. smart fires to the foolish world: "The free woman is bravely gone.
She's actually going to bring the fire of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fire is not the way to clear America. "
It's not unusual that Linbo was actually driven by something.
The meaning of the image depends entirely on the level of awareness.
The most powerful practice of Lazarus is to see it. When tired, poor but desperate people are able to see it on board the ship after a long and often frightening journey.
From the surface, this concerns those seeking asylum and has the opportunity to improve the outlook of people living in the world.
She's like telling them what they want and what they want to hear.
Of course, that's not the view that Miller and Tranpe wanted to admit.
Their fires are not to light up the path, but to burn their only source of energy.
In 2006, Saipup was the first Chinese person to sign a unique music series on the Gianian Goo-Goo's album.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black.
Elid Doyle, remember that there were only two S.U.S. States.
Nil Black, Executive Director of the British Trade Association, said that a team of 16 strong Sogland members of the World Championship Group would make a significant contribution to "the country team".
The number of actors in the London World Cup in 2017 who were elected to participate in the opening of the fifth week of 2017 was the highest in history.
Blake believes that "Sugarland is achieving extraordinary development," British Field Movements must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will keep going until we succeed," Black said.
"I'm talking to the people of the Sugland Sports School who think it's related to them.
The Soglanders consider this to be related to them.
The British Trade Association considers this to be related to them.
That's what even street people think.
Whatever the case, it's very embarrassing."
Many of the Sugland's champions, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, will be elected as the leader of the team at 5,000 meters and Mo Farah.
"Eried's a little stupid.
Her team leader's speech is incredible, Black said.
"Many rural activists, whether they live or practice wherever they go from door to door, are proud to go from door to door.
Irid's natural intrusion and emotion is very good."
He will participate in his fifth round of the 400-millimeter English bank card, which shows that 16 people in the British national team are Swedishs, which is "unimaginative".
Previously, the number of participants in the World Championships in the Soviet field was seven, namely the number of racers achieved in 1983 and 2015.
In the last year, she was created by five British records and two European records.
She's going to take part in 1500 meters and 5,000 meters project games.
Kriss, a 1500-mile project contester, Oherrt, was another of the most interesting Swedish players, and she had achieved a great success in the race, in particular in the British countries in the pre-election and in the Olympics.
Doyle recalled that she was in the first World Cup, and the only one in the team was Lee McConnell.
The chief said that she was very proud that so many of her colleagues did not join the team, and in some cases, she would also challenge the prizes and enter the final race.
"The special feature of the country team is that it is elected by other national team members. So, knowing that your teammates will choose you for a very unusual achievement, it is a great privilege for me, anyway," she adds.
"Of course, I feel very proud of all the members of the Sugland.
It's just showing how far we've gone.
And they're all the old-fashioned champions here, who are about to enter the goal of the Korean presidency.
How did my captain speak?
Well, I think it's great.
I just took this into account, that is, we're very lucky in this situation, because we're going to live in the capital.
Therefore, it is important for us to rely on the main support, and to be able to increase the importance of returning to the Olympics.
I will have a second chance to participate in the race, and the surroundings there will be impossible."
In 2016, there were 18 million employees, up to 1218 million employees, with 21 per cent increase.
Critics on the facebook: If you can't bear the responsibility of the voters, don't vote for public service
Our father knows how bad the media are.
The Americans loved Washington, but soon the newspapers began to beat him severely, from domestic policies to political principles.
He's very angry with these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't shout at these critics.
As early as 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of expression is deprived--we will be killed like sheep in silence and madness."
This makes me think of Larry Hogan, governor of the state of Milan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have been exaggerating and deleting at least 450 people because they have expressed their views on his face-to-face official page.
The U.S. Citizen Freedom Union has brought this case to his attention earlier this week.
The officials of the state considered the proceedings to be of such a low order that the Internet reports were filled with their strong opposition: "Who cares?"
Many people say, "It's just a book."
But it's important.
That's especially important, because it's the opposite of Hogan.
This is one of the common parties who serve as Head of State in a democratic state, and he is also received with surprise.
In the 50th Head of State, he received a good rating number two.
Hogan is not an active emergency agent.
He's in control of the state of Milan, and strict compliance with the rules.
He was also very good at the main way to communicate with the voters as the face-to-faces, and at the top of the main screen he showed his head after treatment.
Therefore, it is a public forum, an official management platform for public employees who are taxed by public officials.
In a interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Shass said that she felt that their comments were being criticized but that she wanted to restrain them for a while.
However, they have described it as a flood storm or a world-famous mangrove network.
"Washington's Post" has spoken to the people who are being attacked by Hogan.
They are only ordinary people in the leadership dialogue with their own choice: they are teachers, businessmen and priests, and they are nothing but raindrops.
They are proud to express their comments with depth, respect, and respect.
The priest quoted "the Bible" in his poem and called Hogan to remember his heavenly faith.
Lakhimi Salma Ramani, chief lawyer in the state of Milan, asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in her part of the news story on the Washington Post, "I kindly commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also do not like to comment on the same subject because they will be directly ignored by some people, who think they are what they are from the public mind, rather than make them a citizen of a particular ethnic group. "
The so-called "infrared waste information explosion" in government officials appears to be "sustained".
In the face-to-face era, it is easy to change a piece of information easily, and only one critic or one negative comment is required.
Furthermore, the removal of far more clean than in the past requires the same effect in the past century to be done by sending outside staff to collect and destroy papers containing criticisms or arrests or shouts of protestors.
But that's really what's going on right now, but it's on the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of complaining about the face books and other social media.
President Tranp is being prosecuted by the Twitter user because he has bullied them on Twitter.
Last week, a preliminary ruling was issued in the state of Virginia, namely on such issues.
According to regional judge James C. Caucaris of the American city of Alexandria, the President of the Board of Supervisors of the Laundry has violated the first amendment from her face-to-face page.
Matt Bevan (R) of Kentucky State is also concerned about the use of books and tweets by the U.S. Alliance of Civil Liberties.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, there was a similar impact on incoming mail and the Internet.
In 1776, the number of newspapers rose to the fourth quarter of the year 1800, and his leadership was highly criticized by anonymous writers.
And even at that time, Washington was also targeted by an anonymous flood storm.
They used Urikla, Valerius, Belysare, and Putins to strongly criticise the decision-making of Washington.
According to the historical document gathered on the web site of George Washington, his office was closed and was criticized for his attitude to the "friendship of the King of England with the United States of America, trade and shipping treaties" signed with Britain.
But he didn't shout at them.
Freedom of expression, freedom of expression and freedom of expression in different states is the foundation of the country.
And the real leader needs to accept this.
The activity of the Russians in the city of the building stimulates the emotions of the people.
The procurement is a strong communication between many urban property control policies.
In May 2017, the China Forum provided that the current generation's annual pension fund would be available for the same purchase policy as the local residents of the same household;
In June, the UFO policy provided for the completion of university diplomas and employment certificates within three years.
Next, the policy code, officially stated, "A student can buy less than 20 per cent of the market price";
In July, it was established that the university of field sciences and the above-study young people were able to complete the certificate and that they could be applied for.
In addition, cities or regions, such as the Port of the Sea, have also emerged from the relevant policies, such as "people enter" and will reduce the threshold for housing for people.
It is believed that this is in fact the most important importance of these property policies for cities, especially for the population, and for retaining the population, especially for the population.
Some even think that this means that the time has come for the city's "requirement" to be cancelled.

Al of Helensburg says: "It will always be more meaningful to go home to the village competition.
You want to do well, but you can feel the extra pressure.
I've been fighting golf all the time.
I am very pleased with the current situation."

In Beijing, 22 Chief of Environmental Oversight Officers of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced the Director-General of the Ministry of Environment for China, 57 of which were implemented in accordance with daily punishment cases in August, and the revised "Environmental Protection Act" introduced this year is a clear indicator of China's environmental enforcement force.

She doesn't even use a knife.
Her wooden house is located in Enarotali, the capital of Panyai, Papua, Indonesia, which is usually the only place for the family to put a red rod — the locals called "nota" — directly into the fire.
Within half an hour, the hot red roses were taken out of their hands without a washing machine, and they were eaten.
Dayja sat on the dirt floor — she had no furniture, and here she was doing daily household chores, such as washing clothes, washing clothes, and washing water from nearby toilets.
There's a water bag in a room with no roof. It's an outside room.
She's the youngest of four wives, so she's not assigned to the field.

"We don't get used to these clothes." She means her beautiful gloves, deep-skinned skirts, and half-skinned skirts.
"We only used to cover the body with trees."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28 per cent of people live below the poverty line and are also at the lowest point in Asian infant mortality.
But this is also Indonesia's gold.
The area of Panyai is located in the same area as New Jersey, with about 153,000 inhabitants. The largest of the world's most profitable gold miners is only 60 miles from here, all of which are located at the headquarters of Philippe McMorandin.
In 2015 alone, Philippe invented some $31 billion worth of gold and mining.
In addition, Baba ' s timber resources are very rich and estimated at $780 billion.
However, these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for the Cubans, and that is why the powerful military forces of Indonesia have been able to exert constant pressure on them.
A 2005 survey of "New York Time Report" revealed that Philippe paid nearly $2 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004 and that a single official was worth $150,000.
The Palestinians were increasingly strongly threatened by the independent self-determination, which led to cruel treatment of the rich.
According to the defenders, more than 500,000 Babaans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass murder in the 1970s in the Baba people ' s heights has increased as a result of genocide.
In the last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report of the Bishops' Bishops of the Bishops of Brisbane, "We will lose everything" covering evidence of the atrocities committed by the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture — another report called rape and electrodes especially universal -- and cruel repression of demonstrations of peace movements.
Andrias Harrison, researcher of the Human Rights Watch, said that " violence is happening every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims. "
Baba ' s resources have been hosted by a large number of immigrants outside of Indonesia, and pressure has begun.
83 per cent of the population of the province were Christians, but their population structure changed after the arrival of the island of Sulawesi.
Add to the list the small ones who are feeding the wolves sell blocs and vegetables mixed with fruit.
The locals are trying to fight.
24-year-old Panyai moved to the province of Chajapra to work, and he explained that "the immigrants began selling milk and food at the traditional market at lower prices than the local Babayas.
This makes the local Babayas - the Baba women (ma-mama) - lose their market. "
President Zoko Vidodo (sometimes referred to as Zokovi) in his 2014 campaign to address the problem of inequality and abuse of authority in Papua.
This old tree road to the city of Jagada has been supported by 27 regions throughout 29 regions — including Pania.
But Baba didn't change anything, and today the locals feel betrayed.
In particular, "We've broken our hearts, we voted for Zokovi in 2014, hoping that he will achieve our wish and restore justice."
In fact, only two months after the 10-month term, Paniae suffered the most terrible nightmares.
On December 7, 2014, 11 of Enarotali, 11 children sang in front of the fire and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly flew over the motor vehicle.
Surprised children told them they should open the car lights.
According to local priest Aahut Tubba, one of the soldiers failed to speak to them and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and observers said these drunk soldiers were shooting at these children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot these kids.
16-year-old Yuliannus Hammer was severely beaten.
A few hours later, the government's election committee was set on fire at the building of the railway station, and the second day's event was on the increase.
About 1,000 young Babaja men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre.
Mee Pago's meita dance -- run around, and imitate the birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the military often.
According to an official document seen in the journal "Times", the situation continued to worsen, and soldiers received orders from inside radios: "If the crowd were to resist more than three times, the shooting would be immediate."
56-year-old Jeremias Kajam was head of the Kego Koto district of Ennarotali, where he felt that there would be a danger, so he called the people calm and asked them to come home.
But no one's willing to listen to him.
He stood at the door of his colorful wooden house and said, "When I came back to my head, my left arm suddenly shot."
Cajama still doesn't know who started the gun, but he said the bullet came from a bunch of soldiers.
He said, "That was a lot of trouble. They fired a lot of guns."
According to the local brother of Olfus Yul, he saw the gun and saw three of it.
Yuhanez, sad to say, "The magazine of the age, "I ran through his body to see if he was...
I found he's dead... and I kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yuj Mend told the reporter that his subordinate was only at the police station "protection" because the police had been attacked.
In 2015, police spokesman Pugio Sullistio said that when a person threatened to kill us, we had to defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
On the second day, news of this murder was broadcast only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi made a speech in Chapla, expressing deep compassion for the victims' families and sworn to resolve the abuse of the rights remaining in Baba ' s history.
He said, "I hope that this case will be resolved as soon as possible, so that the future will never happen again."
In October 2016, the Minister for Security Viland stated that he was going to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical remains of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the delay is almost there.
He said, "Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we have been committed to solving these violations, but it also requires a process. "
Then, on 5 June in Jakarta, Vilando, in his dialogue with the "time" magazine, he said he had not planned to establish a complaint mechanism in Baba.
On the contrary, he said, "Everything will be settled by law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Vilando on the death penalty of more than 1,000 people in an independent vote against East Timor in 1999, but he said that the 11 cases of human rights violations in the Bababa region had been resolved, including the Panyai incident.
The family of the victims of the Pani-Ai incident was ashamed of these words.
“In the past three years, I have received four interviews, but the situation has not progressed.”
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He's still living in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yukabus also felt that the people of Panyai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After the body was buried, the army came to me."
The gun didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in Panyya District, D.A.
One construction company manager refused to help transport a disabled man to the hospital, two conflicts occurred, one death, and 17 injuries, including children.
24-year-old Ravianus Douu died on his way to the hospital when he was fishing near the river.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's current office.
The police said the villagers were throwing stones at the police, so the police were warning them to shoot.
But the Anti-Fraud Force (Indian Military Police) started shooting at the crowd, and one man was killed.
29-year-old Domingo Badi told the magazine "The Age of Time," "We were all tired, and now we're afraid they'll recover." He lived near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
"I've been hiding in the house for two days."
The DIA parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and for the withdrawal of the force against violence from the region.
Panyai has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has grown to the detriment of the peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, which are divided into the central heights of the Panyia River.
A number of people joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), which was a rebel army, claiming to protect the rights of the Cuban people through the division of attacks and attacks against the Indonesian military.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua movement were born in Panyai, including Tadys Yuji and Daniel Yudas Chogoya.
Therefore, over the past few thousands of years, the PANI has been attacked by the military with a coup d'état "protecting the sovereignty of the State" and deliberately detained.
Some people haven't been here yet.
In the eyes of the Baba people, Panyai is a "fortified disaster."
Poverty is getting worse.
Enarotali sells a little poor, and the locals can't afford it.
It's not even possible.
People grow all that they can eat, mainly corn and some fruits and vegetables.
The seeds are women's work, each woman can take care of four or five red areas.
They usually collect most of the leftovers and sell the remaining ones to the local market.
Ten-pound reds are worth only 10,000 Indilubes (75 miles).
With the passing of time, economic inequality has been spreading among local Baba and new migrants, and the number of these migrants has increased considerably since the opening of the new route to the airport in Nairobi.
The number of jobs that are available has generally fallen into the hands of more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Babajas have very little money or the necessary skills to operate competitive companies.
John Goba, President of the Pany-Aid Council, said "Young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no work here and no money."
Baba and the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media reporting remain high.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Baser Luhan were expelled from Baba, because they "did not cooperate with the relevant agencies", even though they had been given permission to film.
According to the Deputy Director of the Human Rights Watch of Asia, Ferim Kahn said that Zukowi had not fulfilled the electoral vows to promote transparency and development.
In a statement, he stated: "If foreign journalists are trying to report the failure of Papua and Zimbabwe in the eastern part of Indonesia, they are at a new risk: refusal of signatures and blacklists. "
No media surveillance means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is essentially limited to neighbouring countries.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Peru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of human rights violations in Papua " , including the Pani-Ai shooting case.
These countries also supported the Free Papua movement.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Almanata Nasser, took no note of the group ' s allegations and told the newspaper of Jagada that " Indonesia is still implementing the democratic system and that media freedom is therefore difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations " .
Locals wish to give more attention to foreign Governments.
According to a well-known observer, on 4 May, when the delegation of the Dutch Human Rights Mission of the Netherlands visited the authorities of Chiapura, the local people broke their silence and asked "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but asked for a name.
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Baba people claim that they are not very likely to vote again in Kosovo.
The President of the National Council, Goba, said that "Zokovy's intention is good, but he was all around him who participated in the Pani-Aid shooting. "
He wanted Zekovi to know that the Panyai people were not only under the threat of living in the armed forces, but not all of them, education and public health services were scarce in this region.
Goba said that the people of Panyai, like the rest of the Babajas, felt that their election to Zokovi was a duty he had to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and fear, the families of the victims of the Pani-Aid shooting continued to engage in their last figurative resistance: to bury a victim's body in the face of the militarized police.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not forget their crimes.
Yukakubus's head is saying, "My family is murdered.
What else can we do?"
The capital base of the capital base is being established by Sofia, a law-encumbered customer, and on 10 February 2017, the Chinese Significance Office approved the application of the head office of a limited company in the Al-Qaest Al-Qa'a's housing department for the extension of the medium-sized market transit licence, which was just adopted by IPO for more than 20 days.
In the view of the private sector, it was considered that, with the fittings of goods, European residents would be moving towards capital points in the area of their fixed residences on the sea.
At the beginning of the new year, a typical representative card house in the area of residential residence was sent to the mayor and attracted the attention of the entire household industry.
Beijing's 9-day road society said that the three-star electronics company's second week had issued a group of auto-pilots developed with the Harmon International, as well as information entertainment solutions, which was an important initiative for the company's entry into the military car through the electronic market.
Three stars bought Haman's international electronics about a year ago.
Three stars have issued a touching warning, a warning from the road and a camera of traffic control functions, which have been developed in cooperation with Haman, at the consumption of electronic products held in Las Vegas this week.
The three-star plan began to produce this year the camera system, which is built on techniques such as machine automatic learning and expansion.
At the same time, three stars show "digital planes", even though drivers are not drivers, and they can make vehicles more personalized, so that this system can allow users to download information from moving equipment and from the rear.
Tonight, the 20th round of the CBA race is about to begin, which also means the second half of the CBA's season of 2016–2017.
The fire didn't start again.
On Friday, a world’s highest housing building in Dubai was set up to force hundreds of residents to flee from this high-level building of 337 metres and 79 high-level building.
It's a fire in the second high-level building in a short two-year period, and it's often called the "fire tower".
The building has been disintegrated and no reports of injury have yet to be found to cause great fire.
"We're sleeping, and then we're awakened by fire, and people start screaming.
We're running down the stairs, running from 50 to about 10 minutes, "a resident named George told the road company.
The civilian defence authorities of Dubai said that the fire forces destroyed around 4:00 p.m. at local time (Ginway Standard Time 0000) and were being treated with heat for the building.
The Government expressed its efforts to provide shelter for affected persons.
This incident may bring back attention to the security issue of the use of outer materials in high-level buildings around the world.
A study carried out by the Great Wall of the Sea after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were decked and unscathed outside walls.
The British police have already indicated that they believe that the temperature and surface system of London's Grünfer building may be the cause of a rapid increase in fire in 6 months, resulting in the death of about 80 people.
The Williams Car also indicated that Massa might be back, even though he has announced withdrawal.
The opening of the Pacific Ocean in Korea on 9 January was only a month away, and the heat and preparation of the Ossetian fire from the south to the north was very intense, and the heat in the country was increasing.
The Korean Revolution, which was expected to be a long-term conflict in Korea, could bring a month's "ego".
On 1 November last year, the San Francisco Memorial arrived in Korea.
The heat from St. John's fire directly reflects the sales of the gates of the holiday season.
Just two months ago, only 32 per cent of the sale of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of salt has fallen to the upper hand.
However, as President of the Coalition Coalition Coalition Commission, Liu-Hungan, had recently predicted to the press, "the temperature in the Gulf of Korea is rising and believes that the market conditions of the gate will soon change."
According to the Korean media, as at 3 January, the sale of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port was 64 per cent, and the sale of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port of the port was also 50 per cent.
In order to encourage the celebration of the Koreans, the Ministry of Justice of Korea announced on 8 days that foreigners visiting Korea would extend their stay in Korea and could stay for 120 days as long as possible.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of United States passengers were carrying contraventions of goods.
A survey of air carriers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had intentionally or indirectly carrying illicit goods through the U.S. Transport Safety Authority inspection station, with at least 6 per cent of which were intentionally carrying contraventions of firearms or other goods.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers declared that they had found the wrong gun, ammunition or explosives to travel.
This investigation of more than 1,000 persons was conducted by Stratos Jet Charterers Inc. and found that young travelers were more likely to ignore the provisions.
It was recognized that there were 19.7% of respondents who attempted to carry TSA's counterattacks, compared with less than 15% of X-generations.
The most common intention is to pass on TSA's items are food and drink.
More than 3 per cent of those who admitted that they had voluntarily carried a syringe and 2.2 per cent of the women's responses and 3.7 per cent of the men's responses had indicated that they were deliberately carrying a drug-containing agent.
The company claims this investigation to be the number of passengers in the country in order to find out about the number of persons who are carrying an accident and who are willing to carry the goods over the aircraft.
It is not surprising that the most likely ones who have been carrying the goods are the most likely ones who have been vaccinated — deliberately or unknowingly — who have been the most frequent.
However, the company noted that the TSA guidelines were somewhat complex.
People don't usually know how much and how many fluids they can carry.
That's why the TSA's best payment is a violation of the fluids.
It was once thought that TSA might also be a consignee.
The domestic flight allows the carriage of liquids, but the international flight is not permitted.
Mr. Purut, Director of the U.S. Environment Agency, changed the concept of reducing regulations in Obama ' s times
After a day of prosecution by 15 states, the Director-General of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Prut, changed his decision to postpone the implementation of the regulations on the reduction of air pollutants in the Obama era.
This change was proposed by Prut, as the Environmental Protection Agency could respond faster than previous Governments.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal to his former position.
The focus of the dispute was to set a deadline for the start of the 2015 Earth-based ozone standards for the states.
In 6 months, Prut announced that he would be delayed one year of implementation in order to allow the Environment Protection Agency to study the plan for more time and avoid "infringing local decision-making or inhibiting economic growth".
Before the appointment of President Donald Tranmp, Prut was the Attorney General of the Republic of Ukraine, who for a long time opposed the strictization of environmental legislation.
Since the arrival of Washington, Prutt has been reversing or delayed legislation against the chemical and petroleum industries.
The sudden reverse of the third week was an latest legal obstacle to the agenda for the reform of the Prut Control.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal decided to extend the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to attempt to postpone the implementation of the provisions of the Government of Obama ' s request for oil and natural gas companies to monitor and reduce mercury spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Prut proposed a major shift in his attitude towards ozone standards, expressing his commitment to strengthening the commitment of the Environmental Protection Board to work with the States to achieve a new standard for complex procedures.
Prut stated that " under previous government management, the Environmental Security Agency usually did not meet the deadlines set, and then, as soon as the group and other persons were involved in the prosecution, agreed to set a time-limit for the appointment of the Environment Protection Board by agreement. " He initiated several times in his previous work.
"We do not believe that we are seriously dealing with the final deadline through the rules of procedure.
We also take seriously the rules and the authorities. "
However, the statement made by the Environment Agency indicates that Prut could be used again to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policies and best information available".
Community parties in the National Assembly are promoting a wide range of changes in ozone-depleting regulations.
The Act of the House of Commons, approved last month, aims at deferring the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
This week, the U.S. Environment Agency was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney-General of New York for his intention to maintain legal pressure.
Chadman said: "The reverse of the U.S. Environment Agency - following our prosecution - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 670 million New Yorkers, with an impact of more than 1.15 million Americans directly affected by smoking. "
In this case, participants in the series of New York States, the state of California, the state of Cornipeg, the state of Lingala, the state of Ilynoi, the state of Estonia, the state of Maine, the state of Minnesota, the state of Minnesota, the state of New York, the state of California, the state of Pennsylvania, the state of Rhodesia, the state of Vermont and Washington and the region of Colombia.
Earth-based ozone is a vehicle, a power plant, a gas station, a chemical plant and other sources of emissions, and the common pollutants resulting from air-slight radiation.
The smoke caused by this would cause severe respiratory problems to sensitive populations, causing thousands to die early each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmental defenders are delighted with the amazing transformation of Prutt.
“It is disturbing that this awareness-raising measure has been exerted by the enormous pressure of the sectoral authorities that protect our air-responsive air requirements.”
" We must finally fight with the Tranmp Government for the idea movement of contaminants and special interest groups. "

On 13 July early in Beijing, the U.S. Somaltus submitted proceedings to the District Court of East Texas to accuse the opium of violating a technical patent for its application in 2010.
The company also used the same patents to prosecute Washington, U.S.A., three stars, Sonny and the East.
The complaint states that iPhone 6s and similar plant equipment have violated the United States patent No. 7,657,386, which is known as the "Central Power Service System".
The accused wished to receive cash compensation, or to receive compensation for the damages caused by the declaration of the judgement.
According to the prosecution, the complainant seems to believe that the quick performance of the iPhone violated the company's patent.
The iPhone that has quick performance will quickly fill the electricity to 80 per cent and then recharge the electricity.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "explicit fraud", because the company does not provide clear products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information on the Internet.
However, they have succeeded in reaching an external agreement with the vehicle dealers, such as Fort and J.J.

The telephone records revealed that Tranmp had demanded payment of border wall costs to Mexico.
The Washington Post revealed a communication record between US President Donald Tranmp and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a call to President Enrique Pena Huto, Mexico, Tranpu urged him to stop publicly expressing that he would not pay the cost of building a border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States was not satisfied with his public assault on the wall, which he was alleged to have said to him: " Don't tell the media."
In the presidential campaign, Tranp pledged to build a separation wall at the southern border of the United States and reaffirmed its commitment to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
He was also published in connection with the communication record between the Prime Minister Malcom Trenbul, Australia, which showed the tension between them.

Morphish case: Activists are reimbursed for the private punishment of racism and the promotion of justice
A 1948 Fort's satellite car ran through a group of viewers in the town of Menro, Georgia, to a small Morbul-Bloom-London.
There are four black passengers and a white driver on the car, and a group of white men with guns headed ahead of the car before they reached the bridge.
It's the head of a terrorist - a middle-aged man wearing a piece of silk - deep in his mouth, and his eyes go into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are scared.
"We want-- Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat and cried out to silence.
Luckily, this terrible scene on July 22nd is just a replay.
But when Roger's neck was on the roof, almost all the people around him were really excited.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Wall of Mordong, where two of the Black Women - Roger and Doulce Malcon and George and Merre Dossie - were sentenced to prison on the night of the private night of 1946 by three K parties.
No one was charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, even though we have seen them in the community, in these years no one has been arrested, it is hard to believe," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize this rehearsal.
"This is the point of history, the burden of our soul."
Brooks, 71, is a former Member of Parliament of Georgia and a life-sustainment activist.
For him, the replay was an interesting call, and every year the people of the city reminded him that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we have to finish the case, we have to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
" Unless we get justice, we have no cure and reconciliation. "
On July 27, 1946, the investigator was lying on a dead body in a Mordvinian prison victim's body.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which was published in the United States National Broadcasting Company, over 50 men from the towns and villages of Menro and the surrounding areas were suspected of engaging in private punishment.
But none of them were prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects have been living outside the law for decades, civil rights activists have shown that the double motive for the use of private punishment throughout the city is well known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the election later that summer.
According to the statistics of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at about the same time, the Black Agroje Malcom murdered White Lord Bannet Hester in a fight, which seemed to be for a woman.
Brooks said that the town's tradition was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife, and her baby wasn't her husband.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on 25 July 1946, a prominent white man, Mr. Roy Harrison, spent $600 on his bail out of Malcolm's prison.
Toxie and Sister Mike Merry and George Dorsie took him to prison.
However, when they returned from prison, soon as they reached the Moron Bridge, a group of private criminals surrounded the car.
"The fact that it was Harrison's organization and ordered that the murder be executed," a FBI report concluded.
" Clearly, there were frauds between the State and the local law enforcement departments, they not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence but also hid the identity of the witnesses. "
Brooks is very clear.
He said, "This is a voter."
"They have been killed by the killer, sending information to black people in the community: 'If you register and vote, you will face the same fate.'
For the past ten years, Kazandra Green has been responsible for the annual reopening of the Moorish prison case.
She's a well-known figure of how to show her hands, her conscience, has a deep roots of racism, and many people hope that such racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder, but Green says it's the key.
"We don't want to talk about private punishment, because it makes us face everyone's shame," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me speak about my own experience, I can't establish a relationship with you."
This year's performance began in June, and the first day there were close to 30 players -- ten white people, the rest blacks -- sitting in a house, listening to Green's presentation of a well-trained performance.
Wade Malbo was the co-director of Green.
For years, he has played the role of three K parties, but he says that this role is never easy.
"I feel bad because I'm not such a person," Malbo said.
"But I think it's very important to keep the purity of the history, because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, the actors of Roger Malcom and Bannet Hester, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were training their presentations.
At the beginning of this game, Malcolm cried out and went to Hester, and he had a lot of air on his wife.
"I said, get out of my place!"
Lascona's back on the way.
Then they hit him.
Then everyone (at least all black players) shouted.
Green's the best.
"What's wrong?!" said Lascona.
He's surprised, confused.
Am I too much?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just think white people don't say 'yes' when they come back."
"Yes," another black actor was interested.
"Your speech must be strong."
In this way, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship has gone unappreciative.
Everyone tried to do so, not only for the performance of the game, but also for the memory of four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, Rascona said this is a word, and it's strong.
No one's laughing.
The replay is strong and quickly over.
Crying, shooting, and then, it's a silence.
A girl in a funeral dress standing next to the actor sings the phrase "extraordinary fruit."
Her voice has been interrupted by other words.
In addition to a hundred meters, about 40 people were constantly washing their hands and their eyes.
Almost half of the blacks and whites in the audience.
There was an exhibition of a couple from New York City from Isaaca, and many people lived near the street.
Brooks took them to the shrines of Malcolm and Toulouse, which took them almost eight hours, and everyone was suffering from an inappropriate cold feeling in Georgia.
Until then, the killer was still a monster, but now, standing on the same land where private punishments occurred, the air is worrying.
When the last sign of the song disappeared, Green was invited to the body of a close observer.
The kids are down on their heads, watching fake blood and body, talking to each other in private.
"They're not really dead," a little boy smiled, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the crowd, and then the performance ended.
The performer opens a private trial and removes the eyebrow.
Bradsey has a three-K-head dresser, Malbo.
Nick Rascona took his two comrades and cried in their eyes; the emotion in the performance finally touched him.
"It's okay," said one of the women.
"We know your heart isn't like that.
You're doing this for a reason."
Then the audience sat down and went into dinner with the actor.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta spoke privately to a black couple they had just met, talking about the rehearsal.
Dennis Duplinsky found it difficult to find words describing her feelings after he saw her.
"It's hard to imagine the terrible words and actions that you say and do, because they look like you," she said.
"For me, it really makes me think that I'm still doing private punishment," she adds, "and now it's called the police shooting."
In the room, Tyron Brooks sat next to the table watching the goods and the rights of the citizens.
He said he's started the show next year.
"Replay is a way of encouraging hearts, as it describes the terror we have experienced, but it is also quite educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this may happen again.
Those who don't study, who don't know their history are destined to re-cover."
The importance of the reform of the "independency of the Internet" in the field of natural gas market reform is not stated, but also greater than the tension and controversy.
On 7 days, the journalists were informed of the opening of the river group at 11:25 p.m., and an explosion of 13 workers was found in the miners' limited labor force in the Guangu City of Dong, North.
As of now, 13 persons in detention have been rescued, rushed to the hospital, and 12 others are in urgent search.
It is understood that the current presence has been blocked, local security, fire and medical services are in place.
According to the observer, when the event occurred, there was a loud noise, and the time was up to the sky.
According to the findings of the Open-Groups of the Organization's Rescued Organization, the Open-ended Working Group (Group) was located in the Gou-Ku-Ku-Ku-in-Ku-Ku-Ku-Ku-in-Nu-Ku-Ku-Nu-Ku-Ku-Nu-Nu, a national-approved civil explosives-discharged manufacturing company, which started in 1958, the former Mining Mining Office.
Since the release of the newspaper (New York Times) 15 years ago, a new technique was required every year, but last year he failed to see it.
However, the audience did not express any dissatisfaction with this, nor did they extend blessings to them because of the failure of the week's father.
After a year and a half, Jeren finally arrived in Beijing yesterday, giving his father the first works, including the 14th edition of "Tegelen's sleep story" in his life.
Media: Scientists at the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering Research Satellites for Cleaning Space Waste
On January 18th, the U.S. media reported that Chinese scientists have proposed a great deal of innovation, using a massive planetary orbit that cleans the atmosphere and destroys old satellites and their space waste.
According to the U.S. Journal of Public Information website on 15 January, researchers at the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering have produced a paper entitled "The Clearing of Small-scale Space Degrading Model Studies", which describes how space debris can be made smaller and does not pose such a threat.
It is reported that over the years, space waste has always been an issue of concern to international space institutions, and the United States Space Agency has considered a number of options for tracking, detecting and removing debris.
The method of cleaning large-scale space debris includes a massive network for cleaning and collecting wastes and can be used to draw them out of orbits. Chinese scientists have conducted a thorough study of radiation and have concluded that this would be an effective way to clean Earth orbits.
The summary of the paper states: " (extreme research) provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris technologies to the platform. "
A 2014 U.S. major U.S. defense company, Lockhed-Martin, found that about 200 threats were daily for satellites running around the streets.
High-speed fragments of the Earth orbit movement were considered a serious threat to future space missions, and experts from the European Space Agency described as "a series of deadly threats".
The U.S. public machinery website of January 17 reports that space is essentially empty, but it is becoming increasingly complex in the space. We are finally sending each satellite into space to become another piece of space around the planet, and as time passes, these particles are collected.
More and more, some of the satellites still operate are higher than the rates in which they are hit and are damaged or destroyed by a million-dollar investment.
It is reported that all space agencies have developed plans to clean space waste in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of explosives to get them out of the orbit, and Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large network, catching debris, bringing them back to the Earth, and Japan's idea is to use a kind of electric casing.
In the light of this, China also proposed a solution to space waste, that is, using a large light-emitting instrument to cut the floating space waste into less harmful small pieces.
According to a paper published in the German edition "Licacy" on a satellite by a group of researchers at the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering, such a lighting device will be installed in a satellite that will at least effectively clean the space, at least on the basis of the simulation results.
It is reported that the only way to verify effectiveness is to test the existing arrangements for such a mission, but it may be late for someone to install a light bulb on the satellite and then send it to space.
Once it has been done, we can finally start a process of eliminating space waste forever.

At the end of July at least 30 people were killed by suicide bombings in one of the areas of the capital of Kabul City.
Taliban claimed they had launched this attack.
On 31 May, a massive explosion occurred in the city centre of Kabul, resulting in the death of more than 150 people, which was the most deadly armed attack on the country since the United States leadership in 2001.
The violence has been illustrated by the security situation of U.S. President Donald Trannon over whether the security situation of Afghanistan's troops and the police has been strengthened by the threat.
It is reported that recent suicide bombings in Kabul have also resulted in a public confidence crisis against the Government and its policies, particularly Ashraf Ghani (Ashraf Ghani).
The United States Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) after a motion for a motion for a resolution to delay smoking legislation
At the time of his appointment, Obama had made provisions requiring the production of various types of emissions caused by tobacco, and 15 States had been prosecuted by the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency.

On Tuesday, the main Democratic Party and the Colombian region filed proceedings against this act, declaring that it was an act of violation.
As part of the broader agenda, the authority of President Donald Tranmp has been working to reinvigorate prior President Barak Obama's environmental legislation to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have led to opposition from the Democratic Party and the Conservative Group, and they are worried that more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environment Agency website stated that breathing with ozone-containing air would reduce the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms, e.g. cirrhosis.

Latest findings of the Swedish refugee age assessment test were published
The latest methods of testing of Swedish refugees were used to assess their age from medically, and the latest results showed that more than 80 per cent of those tested were judged to be over 18 years of age, but not all believed in their accuracy.
The National Medical Centre of Sweden (R.ttsmedicalverket) launched this test earlier this year.
Following the alleged lack of accurate assessment of the age of minor refugees, the Swedish Immigration Verket (Migrationsverket) has designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment in the refugee process.
To date, the Swedish Immigration Agency has sent 6880 sample testers, and the Legal Medical Centre has now published a total of 2481 testers for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) were determined to be up to 18 years or more, but in 25 other cases, the Swedish National Medical Centre also identified the target "may be up to 18 years or more".
In 432 cases, the result is that this person is "probably under 18 years of age".
Only those who have doubts about age.
According to John Glenson of the Medical Centre, these results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local: "These data and the data in the previous months are not very different, and the figures are very consistent. "
Cases of more than 18 years of age are not necessarily reported by those refugees.
In May, the Centre published 581 sample results and said that 442 "shows this tester is 18 years old or older".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 cases published this year, found 243 of which were publicly reported by the trialers to be 18 years of age this year.
The X-ray examination of the brain, the analysis of the function, and the analysis of the results of the analysis by dentists and radiologists, are also in question in some areas.
One of the suspects was the deep-rooted scholar Claude Marcus of the University of Carolina, whose work included assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they were early or late in their normal years of adolescence.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I do not think that the method of measurement used should be so.
In such a way, it is not accurate to determine the age of biological age.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
However, the law-based medical centre, Glenson, has the correct defence for these tests: "It can be said in general that a child is at a low risk for adults " .
The greatest risk is that this person is not 18 years of age, which is about 10 per cent.
President of the State of Sifginia
On Thursday evening, Jim Jastice, Head of State of the Democratic Party of the state of Sivrijinia, announced at the meeting of President Tranmp, that he would change the party.
"I like it too, I don't like it, the Democratic Party has left me," said the governor.
"Today, after I've done a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you today that I can't help you with the status of the Democratic Party."
The meeting went on to shout.
"So tomorrow, I will transform the party into a party," Jastys adds.
"As a teacher, I'm going to tell you when it's time for another game to start."
Tranmp made a solemn commitment to make a significant announcement at a meeting in Sifginia.
Mr. Tranp won 42 per cent of the vote in the state of Sifginia, and Jastys did not support the candidate of the Democratic Party, Hilary Klinton.
According to the Forbes report, Jastys was rated as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
"Fobs" notes that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
At present, his cost is about $19 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Communist Party declared on Thursday evening: "The change of the party to the President of Jastys is a further fight against the Democratic Party, but it will not prevent our countries from becoming more large again, but will make our countries bigger again. "
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 Heads of State Parliament and controls the minimum number of Parliamentary history, and the statement of President Jastys is the latest rejection of a political party that has been lost from the top and cannot be found in the positive uniforms," said Rona, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party? McDeniel in a statement published in the CBS press.

Sebastian Kok says Russia's "extreme" complaint about the alarming news.
On Thursday, Sebastian Koko, President of the International Trade Union, expressed his appreciation for Russia's apology for its apocalypse apology and said that the apology was very "true", but he reiterated that it was not now the time for Russia to resume its participation in the campaign.
The President of the Russian Federation, Mitri Hilaktin, in the International Trade Union Conference prior to the World Trade Center, stated that his country was prohibited from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to fight against explosives.
He said he was sorry that "all the players who got gold and silver in the game were deprived of the prize."
Despite such comments, the International Assembly of the United Nations continues to vote in favour of the maintenance of the ban. Earlier, in the report of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA), the Russian State had found evidence of the promotion of the use of anti-Frauds, which was implemented in November 2015.
"I believe that today's response is very clear, very frank," the President of the International Trade Union said to the journalist.
"The Council and the General Assembly are pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself for a very busy time, and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can resume its participation in the race."
He says he's also "good" Russia has accepted the criteria for re-synthesis.
"I think this is a very constructive day, and we also think we have made some progress, but the General Assembly supports the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Group and is not yet ready for the restoration of Russia's rating," he said.
"We need to normalize this situation within the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate the pure motifs from the contaminated system," he adds.

What impact does the financial rules of the football community have on Neymar?
The rules aimed at preventing the unlimited expenditure of the European Homen Football Club will not prevent Nemal from being transferred from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the Paris-Saint German Football Club (PSG) in France.
As a result, the European Football Association (UEFA) has further reduced the number of football clubs in Paris, and the European Football Association is the governing body of the European Football Games, which has the right to ban the participation of the football groups, which are widely concerned.
The "Financial Fair Competition Rules" (FFP) launched by the European Union in 2011 means that the Paris St. German Football Club must finally prove that the transfer of Nemala will not result in significant financial losses.
The Barcelona Club has paid €2.22 billion ($2.62 billion), only to pay the expenses of the Brazilian football team, and the Nemal wage will be up to $1 million a year.
The following are some of the financial implications of the Nepali transfer to France.
In view of the funds of the team from the wealthy Katarzyna family, the Paris St. German Football Club can, of course, use cash to sign up Nemala and include him in the army of other bright stars.
Clubs can afford huge amounts of money to buy players, but they must use legitimate income sources to fill the huge funds so that they can achieve a balanced balance in the relevant operations of the football.
"The Rules of Financial Equity" was the idea put forward by Michel Platini (Michel Platini) after being elected President of the European Union in 2007.
This former French footballer believes that if banks or all people withdraw their support funds, they are actually cheating and risk destroying the club for the club.
In 2011, the focus of the "rules" was to move from the debt issue of the club to the monitoring of the loss situation of the club.
This change means that Roman Abramovich (Roman Abramovich) was a commercial model used in the 2003 acquisition of the Cherry Club, that is, a potential club, and then a huge improvement in the team and the creation of a global brand, which is now facing a more urgent situation.

It was reported that Nepal may have been part of the income of the World Cup of Qatar in 2022 in Paris.
However, both the Paris St. German Football Club and the Group Committee deny that Nemal will serve as a World Cup Ambassador, but such initiatives are easy for the European Union regulatory bodies.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris St. German football club meant that the European Union would further warn of any attempts to break any rules.
The four-week informant stated that he had not previously discussed with the Paris St. German Football Club about the transfer of Nepal.
These individuals had only been contacted with the U.S. without a specific identity, as they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris St. German football club.

As a cultural art, it is a symbol and a reflection of the constant remembrance of our facebooks.
But as a series, it feels like it's not enough time.
The first day of the camp was a strong reaction, but it was not only because of its absurd silence (the drama was the original story of a meal set to be spoken only by H. John Benjamin Kuming).

The British National Medical Service System (NHS) is a huge green light on controversial HIV drugs
Once the High Court finds out that NHS provides drug financing, patients will be able to start access to "Volorative" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that a drug that could be used before sexual activity has been exposed to approximately 86 per cent of the risk of infection in high-risk groups. The health service body will now provide it with a three-year initial test to the estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed that the Court of Appeal had supported the High Court's decision last year, which indicated that although NHS claimed that the local authorities should provide funds for such drugs, NHS had the right to pay the costs of PrEP.
The campaign announced on Thursday was described by Simon Stevens, Chief Executive Officer of the NHS (Symon Stevens), a “new major intervention”, and the National AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) described it as “a critical moment”.
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Lisbon and Sheffield, the sexual health clinic will be the first registered sexual health clinic to be registered. More hospitals will be included in October and will be fully implemented throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-explosive drug prevention (PREP) is a pre-sexual use to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experience shows that PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among the infected population.
Prior to sexual behavior, PrEP means that there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This medicine can be used every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual men, transgenders, and untreated sundial HIV carriers.
The Institute will determine the conditions and consent to testing participants, including men, women, transgenders and their HIV-related partners, to accept the status of anti-transmitting virus treatment.
Persons living in England and registering doctors in full-time sciences can also participate in registered sexual health clinics where they participate.
The plan would cost $10,000, while the NHS UK branch signed a contract to purchase these drugs after international competitive procurement this week.
The test aims to assess the full potential of the PREP on the basis of a large sample and to gather information on how to place it, how to absorb and implement it.
Mr. Stevens said: "This important new intervention should have a broader and more successful complement and strengthening role in the prevention of HIV.
This is a 30-year period worth another step towards resolving the major health challenges of mankind. "
The British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) Chief Executive Officer Dipola? Kim said: "This is a crucial time to combat AIDS.
If it is actually targeted at the needs and risks of the population, the pre-explosive prevention of drugs has provided an opportunity to change the flow of British AIDS.
From 9 months onwards, the high-risk groups of HIV will be funded through NHS, and this test carried out in England, with a new tool that is truly uniquely implemented, without consultation with sexual partners, which will improve the lives of many.
We agree with this announcement."
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Higgins Trust Foundation, said: "The primary mission now is to ensure rapid launching of the test throughout the country, and not one of the HIV infection victims will fall.

High quality life: application of the building and artificial design to build a comfortable house in the little bunker apartment
Joannie Ray was a banker who was very active in the whole building, and in 2014, she moved from the big house to the small bunker apartment.
This apartment is located in a beautiful palace of Queen Annie -- Johnny didn't collect her clothes, which is powerful proof of the new design.
"Before this, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on a horse's bridge," said Joannie.
"I was looking for a house that was suitable for the price.
I've seen this apartment in the tower, and it's a very tall ceiling.
I'm very concerned, I'll make an appointment that day."
After the first look of the room, this 1,000 square meters apartment is now complete.
This apartment was originally a complex unit -- it needed to get through the kitchen to the bedroom -- Johnny wanted to increase the storage space and the roof so that he could use enough space.
"I want a high ceiling, a large window, full of lights.
That's my request," she said.
To this end, she hired Elvan Azady from Duck&Shed, the construction and design room (in Northland) to use this 12.5-foot skyboard and to build a house carefully. This house was not only a development project, but also a place where Joannie lived.
The height of the ceiling is not sufficient to increase the two spaces below, so the challenge of building is to create a high enough building that allows people to stand.
Elvan must be creative so that he can solve this problem.
"The structure is very complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange space, put it on the top of the line, and don't need the back of the shoulder.
Not only is it so easy to build with a simple platform, but it is also necessary to launch these pillars so that they are around the proper height of the performance of the function. "
By means of this arrangement, Elvan could have access to two fully-fledged rooms in that space -- which could add a lot of fun elements.
The building uses the Retrouvius branding window, which is capable of attracting a fascinating area of life.
The gold furniture with the mirror, the silver little furniture and Serge Mouille have been clearly defined.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the range of space and light.
The mirror on both sides of a short walk can make it look bigger.
In the kitchen, with a mirror, it's like a window in another room.
In the closet, a small glass with a mirror provides storage space for Johnny to store food and glassware.
The beautiful hotel has an attractive space that can be collected when the kitchen is not used.
It's not new.
But the unique features of this broken-out kitchen are at the entrance of a garage.
"This concerns knowledge in a number of engineering areas," Elvan explains the MDF-based door.
"This is a principle of balance, so when you step forward, it's easy to move."
Because of the sophisticated use of space and storage, JoAnni received 16 square meters, more than one bedroom and an improved building.
"At last, what you're selling is the house top -- or say your property value is based on the house floor," Elvan said.
" Basically, the owner of the premises will go into the room and calculate the size of the building. "
They will try to increase space occupying, while using quality materials, thus creating a sense of humor for this space.
Elvan said, "All the materials are your own choice, and thus help create emotional bonds in the home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't touch your heart."
The fact is that, through good design and additional additions, the standard apartment can turn out to be a surprise.
Actually, you might be like Johnny, choosing to stay.

Two brothers fought a huge war on $5 billion in the real estate.
After his Italian family created the King 40 years later, two brothers, worth more than $5 billion, and one of the largest capital empires in Victoria, had fought the Great War.
Colin De Lutis, former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis, lived in a rented house in the Tucara district, and three doors away were his brother Paul's residence.
Since 2014, Paul has been hoping to leave his family business, but the two brothers have raised serious disputes about the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The two brothers and their mother had 38 estates, worth more than $5 billion, which had been collected since 1973 by the family to buy Smith Street in the Colinwood district.
There, the family created Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to 160 retail stores.
In 1999, the company was sold at a price of $85 million.
The money was then invested in the property. At present, the D.R. family's assets group included the City Office, the Non-Lenric and Solento Development Project, the Gold Coast and the Blore Mountains, as well as the Regional Procurement Centre.
According to the agreement reached with his deceased father, his brother Paul Paul had approximately two thirds of the company assets of the "principal proponents and ruling persons" of the D.R.R. family, and Paul was about one third of them.
The documents submitted to the Tribunal indicate that the property value of Colin was $3.16 billion, while Paul ' s property value was $176 billion.
Paul felt that the distribution of real estate and cash proved to be a trading facility.
" The Property Division Recommendation tabled by Colin left for him the best property I consider to be, " he wrote in a first-line declaration in 2015.
On Friday, after several mediation failed, the Supreme Court held its hearings for the first time.
Now, these two brothers are still struggling to gain control of existing enterprises, and Paul says Colin has taken him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of failing to manage certain estates.
In the early declaration submitted by Corinth, he expressed his hope that the dispute would be resolved.
"My traditional Italian family has decided the most important choice, and my Italian bloodless family is the most important " , he wrote.
The costs of the case continue to rise, as well as several hundred pages of declarations, e-mails, as well as corporate reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Carter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and the two-party solicitation attorneys.
Ms. Dr. Ruthis and her deceased husband, Louis, were both immigrants to Italy. They began to operate in the late 20th century, and in the early 1970s, they bought a store in Bronzek.
They used the condoms to buy Colinwood, and Colin opened the family's main beef shop there.
Colin said, "I read three times," and he created Westco there, "at the time Paul was very young (about 10 years old). "
Anna De Ruthis said that she and Louis, who died in 2012, hoped to be able to transfer property and land to her son.
"Louiji often told me that he never wanted the brothers to finally go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the D.R. Group, and Colin said that Mark had paid him $1 million when he left the company and that he had paid him $26 million.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were "not satisfied with the terms of their division of property."
According to Eddie McGuire, who was a member of the Board of Directors of the former AFL Club in 2015, he has remained subject to a subsidization.
" Fairfax Media " contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, as well as their lawyers.
But only Colin answered by letter, he said, because the case had been submitted to the court " I can't really say much."
"My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad," he wrote.
In 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said, "Our father did not want to see Paul and me at the end of such a dispute " and added that he " still had hope of resolving the dispute. "
Friday, this hope seems to be destroyed.
"Our problem will be resolved in the near future by the Court," Colin wrote.

The new Prime Minister's plan to limit the media time of the President
Others have tried, but they have failed.
John F. Kelly may be able to do it.
If that's true, he's the first one.
According to the U.S. Political News website Politico, the new White Screen Manager Plan restricts the flow of information to President Tranmp, including news media reports, with a view to ensuring greater stability for the boss.
The following is a speech by the journalist Josh Daasi:
"When the new vice president, John F. Kelly, started working for the first day with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to address a major issue of President Tranmp's entry into the White House: a flow of negative information from the President's hands."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President make a better decision, so the information would be required by his hand — either in writing or in summary form.
Kelly's diagnosis seems to be similar, but others have also tried to wear it through watching Tranp's media time, but eventually failed.
President Tranmp's TV show has been on for a long time — now in the White House, and he sees the TV tradition still deepening.
In February, former electoral adviser Sam Naberg told Politico: "If the candidate Tranp was disappointed about the unfair report, he would have found it helpful to know that he was also in a reliable way.
At the time, Tara Parmerie of Politico wrote that " according to the experience of the six previous electoral officials, the focus of the tradition of the Tranqud-Tranpud tweet was to ensure that his individual received media information had always included some praise. "
It's all right.
But Tranp's practice has been "controlled" in a ridiculous way.
Maybe these electoral officials know something we don't know -- that if there's no intervention, Tranp's tweets would even get hotter.
We may never know about the tweets that had not been sent to Tranpe.
If his staff can save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one has been able to stop the spread of Tranton.
Part of the problem is in a White House, composed of a group of competing groups, which has been promulgated by a possible and unreliable world view through the distribution of information to Trann.
Politico — all about this story — has been reported by the consultants in May to provide the President with suspicious information on the strategy.
This is an example of what journalist Shane Gudman described:
"It is now said with the former Taranpus official that the reaction of Taranpu to the negative media, such as the fire, and in particular the devastating disclosure of information, would be crazy to discover its origin.
At the end of February, an article on GotNews.com's website, which accused the vice-president, Katie Walsh, of a source of considerable information about the White House, was reprinted to President.
Even though Johnson had been imprisoned forever because of the constant harassment of Twitter, there was no specific evidence, and he had been exposed to a lot of wrongs, and later openly denied it.
Trannon looked at the article and began to ask officials about Walsh. "
Gudman also said that the former Chief of the screen, Reins Pribas and the White Secretary, Robert Potter, had tried to establish a system to manage and record the documents received by Tranqu.
What's the result?
Kelly's gonna do the same thing, three months later.
He may be able to prove himself a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Tranmp or that active Tranp, while his assistant is still competing and struggling with influence.
These eternal effects will make Kelly's mission difficult.

In recent years, the potential for small towns has been gradually awakened as I have progressed in the construction of the entire region.
In 2016, the Office of the Government of the Province officially published "A way to implement the creation of small tourist resorts in the province of Zhao-Qi`i", which introduced a period of about five years, with the names of about 100 indigenous peoples, the ecological quality of the environment, and the rich tourist industry.

The tourist resorts are culturally and culturally linked to Newlands and include people and perspectives, linking visitors to the four-parties, bringing traditional winds and cultures into the co-building and innovation.

strong attitude towards the rescue ship for migrants in Italy
Italy has issued a warning to non-governmental organizations that, if they do not sign new operating rules, they will have to continue to implement rescue.
When the Ministry of the Interior accepted the " Press News" interview, Marco Miniti said: " It is difficult to see what they would think if non-governmental organizations did not sign new standards of conduct. "
On the day before the warning was issued, Italy's official arrested the crew of a ship suspected of the German aid organization 's help for young people's lives in order to help illegal migrants.
The assistance organization operates only for one year and refuses to comment on the specific allegations of the Italian Prosecutor Anbrugio Cartosio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that "for us salvation is now and will be the most important thing in the future, so we regret that it is not currently possible to operate in the area of rescue. "
" After all the information has been collected, we can only now assess all allegations and situations. "
Italy's official began in 10 months to monitor the ship Iuventa of the Youth Relief Organization.
The members of their vessels are suspected of being immigrating migrants directly from small ships, and allow the smugglers to rush out and re-use ships.
According to the document of the Prosecutor, at least one such meeting occurred at sea at 1.3 miles [1.3 km] off the coast of the Libyan coast, which was published by the Italian media.
The members of his ship were publicly suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which resulted in humanitarian zeal rather than any other motive for monitoring relief operations in the region.
According to the rules of conduct, only one Italian police officer was clearly required to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in the search have agreed to comply with the rules of conduct, namely: the Children ' s Rescue Council, the Pro-Activa Open Arms at his immigration centre and Spain ' s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
On Thursday, the latter claimed that the new provisions were not necessary, but could be accepted, as they would not bring any " significant changes and obstacles to their rescue action".
Non-national doctors (MSF) have received Nobel Prizes from the organizations that have been signed.
At the same time, Miniti said that the number of immigrants who arrived in Italy for the past few weeks had been reduced, indicating that efforts to strengthen the border guard of Libya and the joint local mayors had been effective at first.
The minister said, "Several days ago, we began to see the light at the top of the hall."

Michelle Carter, Conrad Roy himself was sentenced to death for sending messages.
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for murdering her boyfriend by e-mail and phone.
The 20-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months in prison and will be able to be reimbursed for a period of 15 months.
In June, he was convicted of an intentional murder committed by Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father will say on Thursday, "My family is sad.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to remain free of charge.
She had been in prison for at least 20 years, but her lawyers thought she and Mr. Roy both had a mental illness.
At the trial, Carter stood up and wore red pants and brown pants, hands tied, eyes covered, eyes down.
" Her act killed Conrad Roy, the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life in order to live better.
She didn't take responsibility, the prosecutor said.
"She has no intention of regret."
But Carter's lawyer says it's "a terrible consequence, she's very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find her "age or maturity, until her mental illness would have a significant effect on her behavior."
One prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Roy Roy, saying, "I haven't been sad for not losing my dear son.
I wish he was proud of everything he did for me and me, and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my suffering, and these suffering will be with us forever," said.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "inspired" because she knew she could never be at her brother's wedding or be his child's daughter.
"The loss of a person who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will suffer like this." She said.
The case seems to have been created by legal precedents, as the laws of Massachusetts did not stipulate that others were guilty of committing suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found to die in a car of carbon dioxide; this year, 17-year-old Carter.
Carter's letter revealed that after he had committed suicide, the case caused national concern.
"Shut up, jump up, hurt himself, there are many ways. " She showed in a few letters sent two weeks before his death; he was at the time alone with the family.
At the time before he killed himself, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," "what you want to do is start the engine, and then you get free and happy."
Judge Monize said that he was concerned about Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to benefit from any media in the case.
There is a legal distinction in this case.
She was accused of killing her British roommates in Italy in 2007 and declared innocent two years later.
30-year-old Ms. Nox, in a special column article published in "Loving in Los Angeles," said, "Michael? Carter is worthy of compassion and help, not imprisonment. "
The art is identified as a controversial film artist from his first film "Rong-Hong-Hong" and has received a lot of non-contestations while he has been leading China's film competitions.
The journalist was informed on 2 days from the Lassa Netball Club, and recently, the Lassa Tseb Youth Youth Group was named fourth in the National Youth Football League in Beijing.
The Lassa Tswana Youth Team is composed of 11 members of the Tseb, who are trained by the teacher for the age-old Lsa Tsunami team.
Before we go to Beijing, we're going to the "Boy Boy" collection.
The Lassa Netball Club's director-in-chief of the Lassa Netball Club's supercomputer-in-chief said that compared to last year's, the team's success has improved, and the team's self-confidence and the team's coverage has increased significantly. The exchange of ballers and other teams is also more comprehensive, and there is also more and more easy exchanges in the field.
Following the end of the contest, the Chief of Staff indicated that he wished to do his best in the fishing business in the West Bank through his participation in the collection of experiences.
It is understood that during Beijing's competition, footballers have overcome factors such as low seasickness and have shown Western arterials.
Although the fields in the Olympics are the gold medals, the farmers have to get under the sky, but the name of the field will be lower than that of the gold.
The car manufacturer's been hit by an explosion, and Ody's going to refurbish up to 85,000 fuel cars.
The previous day, Ody announced that Mumma would provide software upgrades for over 350,000 cars.
President Bama said that she believed that "the driver had more intelligence than the limit," meaning that the cities of Europe - including the capital of the Bama company in Dimonyeh - would consider prohibiting or restricting oil vehicles.
Damler II announced that Europe would be reimbursed by 300 million Mesades cars in order to reduce its oil emissions.
There was no company that declared it to be called back.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States make a huge effort to promote the use of petroleum vehicles to help achieve the CO2 emission requirements.
However, carbon dioxide released by the oil engine is considered to be the cause of cancer and may lead to osteoporosis.
The cost of the installation of the equipment for the removal of the gas pipeline is also increasing, so it is difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of the fuel vehicle.
As the German car manufacturer faces a review, the government led by Prime Minister Angra Merkel was also accused of overspending on these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These vehicles are attempting to avoid overcrowding the public, that is, covering the so-called failure devices, to adjust emissions in accordance with the rules of the vehicle test and to restore normal conditions under normal driving conditions.
Many high-level officials were charged in the United States and other high-level officials were being investigated by the two coastal States in the Atlantic.
Last month, Ody was arrested in Germany by the head of the heat station before the Ministry of Engines Development.
Former Manager Zacro Giovanni Pamio is an Italian, and therefore no extradited protection is possible and trial is possible in the United States.
Earlier this year, Odi was involved in a comprehensive German criminal investigation, and the Government of Germany accused the Odyssey System of avoiding Europe ' s emission requirements, which had been extended only to the extent of the United States.
Ody's investigation may have a significant impact on the public: the manufacturer of the Hawaii car is a proportion of the benefits of a large number of cars.
A film from preparation to show, from two to a few years of history, can be seen in the air.
The film will be released on July 8th, from the preparation of the film to the show for 12 years!
The authors of the "Chief Seas" graduated from the 21st century of the University of California's heat-intensive industry, along with a friendly spring, were created on the other side, and in 2008 they were able to invest millions of dollars from the United States of America's creative sources and started filming women as the Great Sea.
The film has won many awards in the country at the creative stage, and more has been collected by the French modern art centre Bon Piedu and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art".
For six years from the creation of the calendar, the film has been described as a "god".
A surprising story belonging to the Chinese is described by "The Sea of the Sea," which, with the release of this document, brings a whole new prospect to all viewers.
"It's only been doing this for 12 years, and now it's become reality from a dream, and I'm both nervous and excited."
She says: "The old group is going to be mad at me with one-fifth of the budget of others, doing exactly the same painting effect as everyone else."
This "world factory", which once relied on the production of goods and a large number of workers, is drawing attention to those high-level people who can lead to the re-establishment of this city.
At the high-level event held by the Government of the Middle East City, the first financial journalist observed that a number of powerful local enterprises had been contacted by participants.
On the yellow background wall, they marked the price of non-fixed advertising.
Accordingly, China's TV drama industry association decided to sign the Convention on its signature as a joint national television drama industry.
The threat of climate change in the Prussian forest.
The cotton has become a symbol of the southern city of Prunas, France, but now there is bad news that it is under threat of climate change.
Because of persistent droughts and the presence of viruses with viruses, the crop is failing, and it is attempting to find solutions to the problems of scientists and farmers.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute for Agriculture (CRIEPPAM) in PRAVANS, said: "The prairie leaves are at great risk because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, and the spring rains are very low, and the autumn rains are raining.
This will affect the life cycle of the tree.
There is also a smaller muscle, which can spread tiny cells into a very complex atmosphere, which will occur in large quantities."
The key is its huge number.
In addition to attracting vacationers, cleaners are also subjected to the demand for perfumes and confectionery.
Eric Hoss says: "In contrast to many large flowering plants, we have a smaller, less-favoured, less- or less-favoured problems.
So our oxygen content is less."
The solutions under study include better drying technology and the reduction of soil water sources, protective mixtures of soil and water on plants, as well as the development of softer materials.
Compared to the scientific elements in the film, the two main actors showed that they were more attracted to the story in the video.
On the afternoon of 5 September, journalists from the city of Warsaw continued to visit prominent figures of many voices, and two of the performers, who were surprised that they were almost silent.
One is Berlin, one is a senior youth actor, and one is the first partner in the "sin crime" and the first one in Leigh.
Mexico's risk is serious. Newspapers have been killed.
The entire staff of the Riodoc newspaper will usually meet in three weeks, reminding them of their reporting plans for the riots in the state of Rio de Janeiro, caused by criminal organizations, corruption officials and endless drug wars.
But today, tragic shadows are all around them, and they gather together to discuss security issues.
They were told to change their daily routine. It was important.
Two deep-rooted journalists discussed how much safer it was to bring their children to the office (the office had been hit by a handgun in 2009) or to leave them at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They put the journalists under each section on their names, without any evidence, just enough observation and direct attention.
There are doubts about drug trafficking, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or about Carter, which makes Mexican reporting dangerous.
Violence has never stopped, and there have been more and more journalists: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Henrik Benjaminia had died in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the federal authorities following attacks and threats; and at least seven journalists have died in 7 countries to date.
The last one died was their editing and inspiration source, and also the co-founder of Riodace, Javier Waldiz Kadnes.
Waldiz wrote many books on drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist. "
Everyone can feel deeply that he has left, even though he is not in the presence of a large photo hanging in the front of the office of Riodace, Waldiz is referring to the word "just"; the T-shirt worn by two 30-year-olds, Alan Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, also shows his smile, and he wears glasses or his famous Panama hat.
The seminar was not held for two months after his death; the journalists were discussing their joint injuries, sleepiness, sleeplessness and multiplicity.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor ' s Office was established in 2010, only two persons were prosecuted on the basis of the records of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve trafficking in drugs and organized crime, which is less likely to bring the killers to justice.
At Riodoce, they kept reporting about the violence in Rio de Janeiro, although they had already broken their heart, although the land had been rocked for thousands of years.
Ivara said that there was no information from the killer, no justice, so there was no use in holding a security seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to take part in such a seminar.
If we don't know why, you don't believe anyone."
On May 15 in the morning, Valdiz left the office of Riodace in the capital of Zungura.
His red-colored carola was only locked up in a few street areas by two men; they forced him out of the car, fired 12 guns, suspected to be because of the name of the newspaper - translated "Twin River".
The mob drove him out of his car and destroyed him in the vicinity.
Waldiz, 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown children.
Four kuri canals.
But about Walditz, there's nothing really but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested and deported to the United States in the last year, the state of San Marino has become the bloodiest war zone in the country, and the enemy forces have been killing crazy.
One or several people were shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and two graveyards filled with toxic wasteland.
The state of "peace" is temporarily forgotten when only one Carter controls this coastal state and its ports and routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Waldiz was very aware of the dangers of this work, the 60-year-old "Riodoce" co-founder and director Ismer Bohque were no longer angry because his friend was not protected.
He believed that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
In the first two months, Dumaso Lopez published an interview that led by a group of Carters who fought with several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered these boys; the suspects were purchased by members of the group when the paper was sent to report.
The second error was that Valdiz had not been forced to consider leaving Mexico for his own safety after the same story had been confiscated.
Waldiz was a traitor outside Mexico and the country, and his death was significant to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit survives, his friends and colleagues believe he's always with us.
In 2003, he was a deep-rooted journalist of "Noroeste" who, in the year he joined five colleagues in creating Riodace, sold 50 dollars shares.
In the state of Sinaloa, Portugal says, "There is no way to deal with drug problems. "
With the passing of time, the report has gained a good reputation because of its bold and honest reports, and has increased sales and advertising.
Journalists like to be able to produce direct investigation reports without worrying about reviewing them, and readers like to publish stories that others are not afraid to tell.
"Riodoce" received news from Mary Moscabo in Latin America five years after its creation.
The Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Waldiz the International Freedom of Information Award, which showed the courage he was pursuing for the most real Mexican drug report.
He said he was scared too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded a prize, he said, "I want to keep living."
Later in 10 months, he said in a local television interview at Rompeviento TV, "In the state of Rio, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You must take on the task on your shoulders with the status of the journalist, either that way or that of wearing a hat.
I don't want to be asked what you did... why don't you tell me what's going on?"
The entire staff of Riodoce misss Valdiz, forgets him lying flat like a dormitory worker, forgets his friend who has never regretted his recommendation, and knows how to live.
They depend on his habit.
He used to wear that hat.
I always went to the El Guayabo bar, and I always sat on the same table.
Now, they ask: Did his habit of day cause him to fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do good work and how to survive.
"They don't like your trouble with their women and children, and they don't like you affecting their legitimate company and the secret airport used to transport drugs.
They're all over their bottom line."
As a result, high self-assessment and self-defence should be maintained even when it is safest.
Believe your own opinion.
If you're in danger, get out of the way.
"Riodoce," editor of Andreis Viral, said, "the question is "a feeling of being deceived... and then something like that will happen."
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable to the state of San Marino — such as that no longer applied to the state of Tamaulipas, the state of Veracruz, the state of Greero and other states, and that the private streets of these states are fragile, and that there are few institutions, government officials, corruption, and utopia.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where the Riodoce staff participates in security training, they are suddenly not allowed to use the phone; intermediation software sold only to the Government was reportedly used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico a few days ago.
On the outside, two police officers lined up under the tree and avoided 104 degrees (40 °C).
They are the government's offices for the protection of Riodace, which are located in a four-level building in the middle-class street area of Curia.
Some journalists joked that the police would not belong to 50 per cent of what the governor himself said.
Newspapers have gone to the mountain areas for months, where drug trafficking groups are under actual control.
"Riodoce" reported three major events this week.
One of them was killed by the brother of Huario Sessal Chavez, who was shot in the front of the Great Wall of Rio de Janeiro.
The government of the state-owned village also announced its funding.
As well as the kidnappings in a expensive restaurant in Curia, the office of the Prosecutor is only one street area.
Officials have not published information on the kidnappings and the kidnapping process, so it is necessary to make sure that this restaurant is where drug trafficking and the public is loved.
A journalist from public archives learned that the restaurant was registered under the name of a political client of the Party for Political Revolution (PRI) and that the party was headed by political classes almost throughout the past century.
In recent years, the Heads of the Revolutionary System Party have been referred to as corruption in several cases of high-risk cases.
Viral asked the journalists to write an incident at the scene, including the incident of a son of a Mexican leader, Guzman, who escaped military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Waldiz's workshop and search for the most powerful information on this kidnapping event.
46-year-old Viral, because of a lack of material, is called "snake," he says, "we've already known what happened.
All of our sources of information are now blocked.
Waldiz's office is now used to store the signs and posters of the protesters, as workers are becoming what they would never want to be: active media representatives.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a note of his departure from the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a journey related to another journalist.
El Salvador Addamé was killed in Waldiz three days after being killed in the western part of Michigan.
The official found a body burned and claimed that according to DNA testing, it was his body.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more explicit, and they have organized protests and the word "save the media" on people's roads and buildings.
This day, Governor Bohque is not in Washington, he is trying to bring justice to Waldiz and seek international support.
On the second day that Waldiz was killed, Ramirez accused the official investigators of the police during a meeting with the governor of the state of San Antonio, and because they had told the truth that they had killed them.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she also requested that she give up her position in reporting government affairs.
Walditz has repeatedly reaffirmed that Mexican journalists are organized into crime, with corrupt government officials and a society that is not interested in the desert.
In his previous book "Drug Press" he wrote that journalists were not only injured by drug groups, but only on the list of politicians and security forces involved in organized crime and corruption.
The Media Monitoring Group, Article 19, will attack more than half of the journalists last year on police and public officials.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they're letting you die just to keep you shut up."
Clearly, these murders are cruel and disgusting.
There was no one to forget that six years ago, Bobor Maria Elizabeth Massias died at the border in northern Tamaulipas.
Her body had a letter that was supposed to be signed by Katascatr, "I came for my report."
Her head was cut off and put on a computer keyboard and an ear.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some press elections were closed, such as the "El Norte" newspaper in the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continue to be killed by "El Manana of Nuevo Laredo" in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez opened a public drug dialogue with a headline entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or have even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find jobs in the refugee camp, and they still need to be careful and alert on the streets.
Sometimes they will be arrested, said to have been killed in 2015 by photographer Ruben Espinosa in three months after fleeing Veracruz in a city in Mexico City with four women.
For those who continue to work behind the screen, this is a daily step of high resolution.
Ivara had wanted to be a prostitute, and he admitted that he was afraid of drug trafficking.
He said, "Mexico is becoming a hell, so I became a journalist."
In the last Friday night, the latest newspaper had been published, the editors of Rioduce sat on the streets outside the office, and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of armed conflicts between the enemy forces and security forces near the city of Masatar has been identified by 19 people.
The war is also on the rise, as a series of Carter information forecasts have been found in the region.
They're on their way through the phone to the website of Riodoce.
The next day's chapter has to be changed.
The police shouted nearby, and there was another gun fighting in the area.
There's a police officer standing there, watching if they're awake.
If they had a little fear, they wouldn't show up either.
The author of this paper has died, and in his huge painting, he refers to the place where the entire state of Riodace needs hope, followed by his steps.
"How do you even want to shut up? Haver was killed the same day, and the practice asked me to send her to the street."
China from its 2020 market size or infringing billions of dollars
[Summary] In a large context of consumer upgrade and free movement, the encouragement of national policies from travel and the interest of more and more consumers.
At the same time, however, there are two challenges in the self-sustaining self-sustainment market.
In the context of consumer upgrades and free movement, the encouragement of national policies and increasing consumer interest have been encouraged by travel.
At the same time, however, there are two challenges to the development of the tourism industry and market needs, and on the one hand, the difficulties faced by travel clubs and travel companies are relatively small; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by the travel industry are also at the primary stage.
60 per cent of the total domestic population, the market is expected to be inundated by millions.
In 2016, 44 million people travel throughout the country, about 60 per cent of the total number of passengers from the country concerned, and the market size from 2020 to 2020 is expected to be broken down by millions.
According to statistics from China ' s Association of Travelcraft on the number of passengers leaving the train, the number of passengers has increased steadily over the past five years, and the number of passengers in the country is more than half stable.
At the same time, areas as well as national levels have shown increased interest and support in the area of innovation in the area of self-equipped travel, and a comprehensive policy framework is drawn up in 2016 to 2017 with regard to motor vehicles, passenger cars and explosive tourism.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Board and the National Sports General, together with eight sectors, published "car development planning from the Field Development of the Movement" and, in the same month, the Commission, a joint programme for the promotion of rural tourism development in 14 sectors, including the Ministry of Finance, focused on tourism promotional activities for rural development (2017).
Policy outputs provided opportunities and policy guidance for domestic travel development.
The entire industry chain is the key.
Despite the enormous potential of the domestic self-sustainment market, national policies are actively guiding, but the tourism industry remains in the primary stage.
According to China's Annual Development Report 2016-2017, there are thousands of people in the country's national sports club, car club and car club, but the percentage of self-help arrangements is mainly made for passengers from the race, including those from different agencies such as the Travelling Club.
At the same time, the number of online tourism companies and traditional tourism companies from self-exploited travel products is also high, and many of the products sold on the online tourism platform are only provided by some suppliers, and some of the self-trafficking clubs are important suppliers.
From organized travel activities, it covers "food, housing, transportation, shopping, multifaceted areas, high levels of fractionation, high flow supply chain, high level of consumption of tourists.
In Beijing, the manufacturer and CEO of the truck club is considered to be the same in nature and travel companies, and the early main forms of entertainment are under-line activities, and the core is from travel products and team services.
Now, however, in the area of travel, the quality of the road products is severely standardised, the level of leadership services varies, and the needs of the travel club are re-transmitted.
It can be seen that navigation itself is not an independent industry, but it is a cross-cutting environment, an ecological environment of industry, and a complete industrial chain.
The experts noted that experience was more important than basic tourism consumption.
Therefore, the development of self-trafficking industry should enhance experimental characteristics, develop the theme "equipment+" and IP from travel products.
It's not just the road. It's not just the parking lot.
In the face of a self-propelled exercise, the basic set of self-sustainment is also relatively primitive.
Liquéj pointed out that the tourism perspective is not only a road but also an integral part of transport and tourism, but that the adjustment of road and tourism itself is responsible for two sectors, the increased tourism element of the transport sector, and also remains in buildings, consultancy centres, advertising camps, and the relatively low level of tourism.
The experience of construction is based on a well-known self-proprietary route, the United States 66 road.
The vision design is no longer the fastest route between the destination and the most direct route to the destination, but it is based on the design concept of the "tested car fun" and provides the best benefits for tourists on the road; it is able to focus, link the views of the tourist and preserve the historical values and cultural values of the coastal ecological resources, and it is possible to organize a variety of thematic activities to enhance the participation and tourism experience of tourists and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the views of the camp, it is also an important package facility for self-propelled travel.
But there are few consumers who choose to live in the camp, as New Yorkese journalists know.
They believe that many camps are focusing on infrastructure, only to satisfy the needs of the many elements of their journeys, which include a lack of housing, a lack of records, a lack of productivity, and a lack of self-sustainment.
There was a lack of knowledge of the names of businessmen that many companies working in camps years ago did not follow up on the construction and services of the later packages, and many of the operating conditions were lost, without late financial inputs, and it was difficult to make some suitable packaging products.
Consumer groups
According to data published in 2017 by the Chinese Railway Association, since the age of 2017, the group has been concentrated on 21 to 40 years of age, of which 31 to 40 years of age, of which the population has a certain economic base and a higher demand for individualized tourism and more for family visitors.
From a housing survey, the number of passengers is relatively better than the standard housing.
From self-propelled type, around itself is the main type of self-proprietary, which is 84.32 per cent.
It's a lot of people, but it's smaller than that.
At the same time, as the consumer needs increase, visitors of the past like to begin to change their views, not by taking photos of cars and sleeping on cars, but by giving more attention to the experience and process of travel.
The terrorists used their armor to protect the enemy.
It looks terrible, but it looks like an honor.
Researchers have published the first study on the size of the landmine mine miners found in Canada, such as the size of an unimaginably large, biodegradable rock, which indicates that it has been preserved in good faith, and therefore experts call it "Monarissa of the Trojans".
This magnifying stone has been very perfect, and it can even determine the color of its skin as red, which means it has some "stupid experience".
The relevant report in the journal "modern Biology" describes it as "the best preserved omelets found in history, as well as one of the best signs of hormonal in the world."
The rock is a new species of end-of-square, which lives between 1.1 billion and 1.1 billion years ago.
Its storage condition is very complete and alarmed by the researchers, who describe it as "very attractive to watch".
According to the National Geographic magazine, the dry-food-based terronite rock is the best preserved of the same type of terronite rock that has ever been discovered.
Shawn Funk (Shawn Funk) was discovered on 21 March 2011 at the Sankor-Million mine mine mine mine near McMerliburg, North Africa, Canada.
At the time, he encountered something that seemed not as big as the rocks around him, so he decided to look carefully.
Then, what he found was transferred to the Royal Terrigo Museum of Biodiversity in Canada.
For six years, researchers have revealed the true sight of this wild animal in the soil of 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
After this hard work, the final result is now to be published.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said the first author, Caleb Brown.
"It will be one of the most beautiful in scientific history to preserve one of the most perfect characters of terror -- Monarisa in the region."
By studying their skin, researchers have discovered that this plant, although ingested, is similar to walking tanks, but it is likely to pose a serious threat to the food terror.
The body-shaped horrors used red-white clothing to avoid predators and used the so-called "resistance" technique, which is also used by many modern animals.
The experts indicated that through this method, it could be better integrated with the environment, thus avoiding enemies, indicating that it was caught by a larger terrorist attack.
This 1.1 billion-year-old biology belongs to one of the final members of the London family, which was the first news in May and is currently being presented at the Royal Museum of Biology.
Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the museum's technical staff, has been conducting research on the subject and has been called "Boreeopelta markmitchelli".
The sample was very complete and enabled Dr. Michel, as well as the international scientific team, to record the paintings and shapes on which they were made.
They've found "responsibility" that is a common form of protection among animals, which means that the back of the animal is darker than the color on its side.
Although the "restraint" has often been seen, the results are surprising, since the body type of the dragon is far beyond the existing animals that use anti-smokers.
This terror is faced with the pressure of the slaughter of the meat-crazy sharks, thus increasing towards a favourable direction, enabling them to hide inside the nest as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals, such as red, yellow, or yellow, are as small and vulnerable as the fish, indicating that the animal is faced with real life-pressure.
"The huge amount of cartilage has been caught by the crazy food chain shows how dangerous it is for the white shark to eat," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its film also indicates that the skin color of the horn is red.
Scientists are continuing to study the bio-life guide, including its stored mercury content, to find food that is finally in circulation.
They believe that at death terror penetrates the river and then falls into the Great Sea and finally sinks into the bottom of the sea.
At that time, the climate in Alberta was as hot as today's climate in the southern state of Florida, and rivers and oceans might be deeper into the land than they are now.
Brown said: "It's really amazing, because it's completely covered with sandy skin, and, so far, it's in space, so that it's the original form to be preserved."
"Therefore, the shape of the species now is almost the same as that of the white shark.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping."
The period of the white shark is the time when the giant foot-and-mouth terrones walk on the earth.
Despite being a king in the throne, it appeared a million years after the demilitarized throne.
They include a high-square, a 6-pound, 38 feet long (11.5 m).
The latest research found that scientists who are present in the journal "modern Biology" believe that after the end of the monasteries, the tree was planted in the soil.
On 21 March 2011, Sean? Fink dug the animal into the thousands of mines near McMerliburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-selling terlon, and the skin and membranes in the region from the nose to the spinal cord are perfect.
This biomedium is approximately 18 meters (5 meters), weighing 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20-inch angles that rise from the edge.
The researchers believe that such arable landmine terron is currently active in the western regions of Canada, followed by a flood in the sea.
However, this horror buried beneath the sea makes it completely preserved.
This special sample preserves very well the remains of the remains, and remains cover the inequities of the coral reefs on their heads.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this level of preservation is very visible, as is the case in the Middle Ages.
I see more and more as I think it's incredible.
The remains of the remains are still covered on the remains of the remains that are scattered on the pelvic bone.
It's right in front of it, and it's up to five feet.
I can print out its chemical statistics."
Journalists have learned that the addition of natural or plant-based marine acids, corpus acids and acidic acids to the production of opiates may increase the effect of traditional opiates, resulting in the formation of chlorofluorocarbons, and the use of chlorofluorocarbons increased by 5~10 percent.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for growth is evident, especially in the case of large-scale increases in opioids than the quality of BB.
The total number of security personnel is more than the number of security personnel at the London Stadium in 2012.
In order to ensure the security of Rio, Brazil will launch the largest security union plan in history.
Previously, the Government of Brazil had indicated that 850,000 people from the army and the police would work together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most soldiers will be responsible for the protection of the ostetrics, while the new 3,000 soldiers will be responsible for international airports, land stations and roads.
The police are in other local patrols in the city, including railways, public transportation and roads.
It was reported that 6,000 military personnel have now arrived in Rio for Oslam Security Service.
In addition to the four major areas of Rio, they are responsible for patrolling the main roads of the airport as well as the airport and the ossetia.
The introduction of an evaluation mechanism in the service sector was not a new matter in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, and it was important to make the regulation more effective and non-transformable.
How do the progressiveists learn to answer the question: "Who's the road?"
On 9 August 2014, the heart of Brittany Ferrer was disturbed.
On the first day of the trip to New York City, this Saint Louis sat on his bed in love and visited the faceline on the phone.
She suddenly found a high-school kid.
It says, "The police just killed a 18-year-old boy, and the kid was lying on the street."
She found that no one else was sending this information on the e-mail, and she was very confused.
A @TheePharoah user kept sending her a motion.
Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was not carrying weapons, was killed by a white police officer in Fuggson, Missouri.
He put a brown body lying on the street, his body lying on the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrer thought.
But death is nothing new to her and her communities.
She put her cell phone down until that evening, and she read a tweet about the people gathered in Kaffield.
There's a photo of the police video and people calling it, and a photo of the man who called himself Brown's father, and it says, "The Frogson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a local police station with a dog stand in front of a group of protesters.
She said, in another video, another cop raised his gun and said, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalls.
"It's not what we're used to, it can be called a typical murder. "
At that moment, I felt cold and tired.
I'm angry, I'm crying."
She's scheduled for a return trip. She's home the next day.
At 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferel and Ferguson, the theme of a new video "Who's Street?" that appeared in the camp on August 11.
This is a story about people living in this community who have filled the streets with a demand for answers, about survival and protests, love and loss, power and strength.
When Ferrer and his daughter were driving together on a wooden table and wearing a mask, two people re-examined the subject they had discussed before that morning -- "The experience of black people and the situation of blacks".
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people must fight for their faith?" she recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, that's not right.
I have to take her, "Ferrell.
"What's going on today is all the past... high.
She wants to know, see and get out of this.
She not only needs to develop well in the areas of advancement and organization but also to understand the different levels of the experience of black people and the situation of black people and to know what we must do to gain freedom and freedom.
Even though I'm happy to give her an experience of racism without her own body, she has nothing to do with other black girls.
If I protect her in this case, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at the first station in Fuggson, in a place opposite the South Florida police station.
Ferel and her daughter are in contact with a local business boss who is cooking lunch.
They've prepared the bags and are responsible for sending the bags to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer started to form a new type of actionist.
She said, "My enthusiasm has changed completely after 9 August. "When St. Louis, State University, Missouri, was reading the book, she was the president of the Association for Minority Health and was concerned about food justice and health gaps in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
It's all here."
A few weeks later, Ferel met with Sabakh Folyan during a night's tour.
Flojan says she and her film director Lucas Alvarado Fare just wanted to record what happened.
The question is, "Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion is the source of many of these cases: people - usually white people - enter a community to benefit from their pain and anguish.
As Fellian explained in his recent interview, "we have heard that there is no focus on their voice in the Frogsan natives, and we want to do it in different ways."
Flevia has been in contact with the co-director of Damon Davis, a regional artist known as the progressive and well-known artist of the death imprisonment.
His involvement led Ferrer and six other locals to join the project team "Who's Road?", which has not been abandoned in years after the fires of Brown.
"This documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us, it's our speech."
"I'm primarily concerned about how these people appear, because it's also the way I've been shown."
Although the goal is not to worry about Ferrer's experience – but to show the event "not about the leader of salvation, but about community cohesion," Folly said – she proved to be the most open of the film participants.
As a result, "Who's the road?" It's amazing to record Ferrer's personal life, such as getting in love and getting married.
"I feel like I'm ugly," Ferel laughed when he first saw it.
"But I understand that doing this work and genderizing black people must have a certain degree of vulnerability. "
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirmed and re-established the role of black whore women in the wider black lives event.
Two of the three founders of the campaign -- after the 2012 young black youth, Trevan Martin was created on social media #BlackLivesMutter -- was identified as cool.
"The black girls in the leadership played a part in this campaign," Ferrer said, "that's because we are fighting on many lines of war.
The black girl's cool girl must bear all of this."
Florian agreed and said " This movement has really received support from black women and many black girls. "
Because of her identity, Ferel was chosen to be the center of the video, but she insisted, "It's not a certain action for things."
"She's a man of power," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence, because in the lives of these cross roads, as a black girl, you have many things to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
At the same time, in Ferguson, the media has already disappeared, but there are still ethnic tensions between communities and the police.
Because of attempts to block high roads during a trip, Ferrer was sentenced to more than two and a half years of imprisonment.
She described the social political context of the region she called her home: "A bad group."
Nevertheless, since the three years since she was on the streets of Ferguson, she has been holding on to the sacred songs she has tried to remember.
"We have the responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have the responsibility to win.
We have to support each other in love.
We're no longer lost, except for the locker on us."
In fact, online translation services have been provided on the network ten years ago, and indeed early on, there is no denying that the "mechanical machine will soon replace human beings".
Similar: The DNA created by the artist using Chelsea Manning
There are a number of faces in the center of the exhibition hall in New York's Freedman: white, black and red, each of which has almost the same appearances, which are bound by lines from the ceiling.
The 30 pictures were created by artist Hister, Duwey-Hagborg, using Chersey.
Mannin, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison by intelligence analysts, was sentenced to prison because of a secret diplomatic e-mail through the Wiki-Communication website.
The exhibition was opened on August 2nd, titled "the same area".
This is the result of two years of communication between Duwie Haggburg and Manning, Duweh Haggburg combined his studies with his own technology, computer science and art, while Mannin was a well-known divergent, and ended up in prison, where he was sentenced to three days before the end of his term of office.
Through the analysis of the calculation of DNA from Mannin, and thereby created 30 images of "probably visible external charts". Heterduwie Habog made a very brief and rather unfortunate comment on this. His comments were both multistaken to DNA, and also to the concept of identity itself.
The name Bradley Edward (Bradley Edward) publicly acknowledged that he was a woman at the time of his birth. In 2013, he was convicted of 20 allegations, including 6 inter-law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In the prison, her image was blocked, with only one picture, with a black picture of her skin, which seemed obviously uncomfortable, sitting on her lap, wearing a golden falcon.
In 2015, Hisserduwi Habog achieved great success in her 2012 project " Stranger Visions " .
In the article, she used a court certificate from tobacco and oral sugar, a DNA derived from a fracture, to create a 3D similar human image.
That's an e-mail she just received from Paper magazine.
"They want to visit Chelsea Mannin in prison and need a photo of her son, " and Hesterduwi Habog spoke to the media in an opening ceremony.
She was unable to watch or photograph, so they contacted Cherie and asked if she was interested in making DNA photos.
Thus, this artist and her imprisoned cousin became an impossible friend and exchanged many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a "pressure image" of a comic book, painted by Shoili Kanungo.
And Obama asked her to be released a few days after she was published. This may be a coincidence, when Mannin was just over the seventh year of his military prison in Kansas.
In addition, the exhibition is of another depth, because in the United States of America, the government has consistently declared war on government secretaries and revolutionary soldiers, while finding new ways to break up on Twitter, and this exhibition is intended to combine.
When asked about all this special occasion, Hesterduwi Habog said, "There's a reason for anything."
In an artist's statement written on the wall, Mannin's super-significant sign below (in the name "i" with a heart drawn up) called for the end of "diversity of parties based on sex, sexual orientation and culture."
On the wall is her linear DNA sequence, with a cross-sectional curve, Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By including 200 letters (or nuclear acids, a complex scientific dictionary for every artist), Hesterduwi Habog wishes to express at least on the organic structure that people are like.
"I hope people will get out of this situation, our genetic group will not care who we are, how we read the public genetic data, how it is the subject of "Hesserduwi Harbog" and his 2007 film work is also showing a false memory."
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so it's 30 of them."
The last work of the exhibition, in one room, comes from a page in the front diagram.
It was shown that the U.S. soldiers were floating under the expander, a man of the Kim Cantonese type.
"When they stop your talk, they win," wrote the wall.
"So, don't shut up."
"These articles came directly from her writing to me, " which came from the artist from the city of Fei.
"I'm afraid again, I'm still telling you."
Mannin hasn't even seen this show herself, as expected in the comic book, but when she does, she will be welcomed by her own DNA painting, like a group of protesters at the exhibition center.
It is also meaningful, as is the case with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the information she has written on her cell phone (5.2 meters, Mannin's height).
"In the past, I put them on the wall, but I hope they think they're like a group," said Duweh Haggburg about the painting.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protestors who followed Chersey, just as people were going to release her."
Professor of the University of North-West and staff of the University of Oxford were interviewed
The police indicated that a man was found to have been killed in Chicago City Hall, and a professor of the University of the North West and a university employee was subsequently contacted, and that suspects are now being searched throughout the country.
The record of the Cook County Court shows that on Monday, 42-year-old Wyndham Lessem and 56-year-old Andrew Wallen were sentenced to death by a non-warranted warrant for murder.
According to the document, 26-year-old Connell Duranlon died of multiple injuries.
The community alarm issued by the Chicago Police Department stated that the body was found on 27 July.
After the police got to the Grand Plaza apartment, they found a lot of injuries on the victim's body.
The police said Connell Duranlo was dead and the investigation was investigating his murder, while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Since 2007, Lesem has served as Deputy Professor of Microbiology and Immunization at the University of North-West.
In an e-mail statement, the Deputy Director of the School Relations, Alan K. Cobbec, indicated that Lesem is now away and has been banned from entering the school in the North University.
“Now this is a criminal case, and the relevant authorities are investigating, and the University of North-West is actively cooperating with the investigation.”
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
In an e-mail statement, the speaker of the University of Washington University said: "We have kept in touch with the British police and are ready to assist the United States investigative institution as necessary. "
The statement adds that Wallen's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he could vote for himself.
The chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Gullermi, strongly encouraged suspects to take the lead in the authorities.
Guillerme said, "The police have a general idea of their descent, and we are trying to find a location where possible."
Gullermi said that local, regional and national authorities were working hard to assist in the search for suspects.
Guillerme said that the police had received a phone call from the Director of Grand Plaza, who had just received a secret notice that the 1008 apartment had occurred.
The police said the situation was terrible at the time.
Gullemi indicated that it is still unclear whether the event took place on 27 July.
He said, according to security footage, he confirmed Lesem and Wallen at the time in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lesem and the victims have a relationship," said Gullermy.
The management team of the Grand Plaza made a statement to the population: " The police are currently studying the timelines and background of the victims and are investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents. "
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutco said, "We will complete the world road map in the near future."
The Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Vitali Mutco, said that the implementation of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) would not be overdue to the rest of the standards governing the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Retraud Body (RUSADA).
" The implementation of the road map standards has been carried out at a certain stage, and RUSADA has the right to plan and test with UKAD.
WADA's road map has been updated in this regard, "Third Mutt.
In commenting on the second part of the “compliance with the provisions” road map of the world's anti-inflammatory institutions, the Deputy Prime Minister Mutco provided standards for the restoration of the rights of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.
According to the Mosaic Law, the standard does not include any matters that may cause Russian concerns.
He added, "Everything has to be declared, everything will be implemented.
And in the near future, the results will be submitted to the International Committee of the Regions [IOC] and WADA."
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list was that the Russian Anti-Fraud Agency must publicly accept the findings of studies approved by Canadian lawyer Richard Michael on WADA on the support of Russian States for the use of anti-Smoking events in its national sports campaign.
In this regard, Mutt said: "We are investigating that our immune system has certainly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist."
Mutco replied to Vitali Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Reaction Committee.
Smirnoff, who had accepted a visit to the Russian outlet RSport earlier, acknowledged the issue of the existence of Russia's immune system, but he added: "We have said several times in various cases that the report contains conflicting positions and provisions.
No one is planning to accept this report unconditionally, Smirnoff said.
In November 2015, following an outbreak of the virus, WADA suspended Rusada's right to carry out an anti-inflammatory inspection in Russia.
However, this year, in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate checks under the supervision of international experts and UNHCR.
WADA, Director-General Olivia Niagry, visited the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, indicated that RUSADA was "in the right direction", trying to restore its rights.

We don't have to buy any more!
At the sampling press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, a high-level speaker from the Ministry of Commerce stated that, as of today, our country had 15 self-employed agreements, involving 23 countries and regions, covering the remaining 8000 import products of commodities.
At the same time, the imported products, the Icelandic tributaries, the Chinese red wines, the Asian hot fruits... these products you want no longer have to be bought at a price.
At present, my country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have entered into force, covering the remaining 8,000 import products of zero duty.
For example, as a result of the implementation of the Trade Agreement, consumers can spend four months each year on products from different sources and quality-quality agricultural products.
For example, the Asian rainforest, sludge, hot-rolled fruit, such as the fire pellets, import tariffs fell from 15 per cent to 30 per cent to zero.
The import duties of third-country fish are reduced by 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs fell from 14 per cent to 30 per cent;
There is also a greater reduction in the number of special agricultural products such as beef and milk in New Zealand.
(c) Import tariffs for industrial products, for example, in part of Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
The import tariffs of the table were reduced by 50 per cent and would be reduced by zero tariffs in a few years;
Korea's electric refrigerator, kitchen and mollusc import tariffs have decreased by 40 per cent and will be reduced by zero in a few years;
There is also a greater reduction in taxes on electronic products such as consumption.
At the same time, commodities under the Trade Area also include the necessary intermediate products and raw materials for the production of domestic end-use products in many countries, and have contributed to structural improvements in the country ' s consumption.
The press speaker in the Ministry of Commerce commented on the fact that almost one third of the products from my country's total imports can benefit from the treatment of preferential tariffs from the Trade Agreement, most of which are final consumer goods and bring real benefits to consumers.
Further reduction in import tariffs for consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, my country has adjusted the import tariffs for certain consumer goods and has further reduced the import tariffs for consumer goods, covering food, health products, pharmaceuticals, daily supplies, shoes, household equipment, cultural entertainment, Japanese currency, total 187.
The average tax rate for these consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost by "injurious"!
Since 1 January 2018, my country has also made some adjustments to other import duties.
(c) Import tariffs from 10 per cent to 5 per cent of the import tariffs for certain ingredients such as salts, oats and salts;
After the reduction of tariffs, it meant that consumers did not need to be reprocured and that there was no longer a need for foreign products to be purchased outside the country that was old-fashioned.
In 2018 we import goods: import of red wine, nuts, fruit...
External reports: The United States final trading year provides a wide range of purchases to be careful.
New Central Network 29 December
According to the U.S. World Day newspaper, Christmas just came back.
According to the U.S. Broadcasting Company (ABC), over half of the goods sold last Christmas last year were repatriated.
In addition, a number of readers have been deceived into buying explosives networks and consumers need to be more concerned about buying things on informal websites.
In general, large purchase companies have formal and reasonable withdrawal procedures, but there is a need to be careful if they buy gifts from certain small shops or electronics.
Ms. Rolang's local-time maid, who was at a store on a special-saled stock store on 1 December, bought a package of over 60 dollars (U.S.), and has not yet been sent.
She sent the mail to the guest, and she didn't see any response.
Other online explosives, last year's U.S. travel, bought a cell phone to third party sellers, and then found it in the back of the box.
If you know that you have been deceived, you can apply for a discount on the website and get a full refund.
However, some customers also believe that the website's discount service is not 100 percent perfect.
A North American resident king of Watts said that there had been two purchases of emergency delivery services on a site and a four-price service, but neither had been sent on time.
Then they applied for reimbursement, and they were not answered.
There are better returns policy in large markets or shopping areas.
Macy's spent a total of 180 days in the majority of goods.
But the goods must keep the original "like" and have to buy receipts such as receipts or bank records.
In the absence of a certificate, customers can also obtain a collection of goods and purchase other goods.
Targets normally have 90 days of withdrawal time for general goods, and electronics usually 15 days.
However, the electronics purchased for the period from 1 November to 25 December 2017 for the period from 30 days to 30 days for the withdrawal of goods of the category of entertainment.
It is important to note that the period of 30 days of withdrawal shall be calculated from 25 December, i.e. to repatriate until 25 January 2018.
It's a very great shopping experience, and it's a new era in the development of the shopping circle.
Over ten years ago, my country was in the market in general, and people's choices were limited, and needs were limited.
But after decades of development, the market has already achieved a shift from the market to the market for buyers, and now consumers are enjoying a lot more, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple purchases of "a hand-held hand in hand" that are simple.
As a result, the next competitive point of competition among property producers was how consumers received a very high-performance procurement experiment.
But in many factors affecting consumer procurement experience, the impact of the shopping centres in the business circle is the most important.
See how urban builders focused on procurement.
There are no two completely the same nests in the world and no two completely the same shopping centers, a well-known shopping centre must belong to its own particulars.
For example, Kanyon, a world-famous shopping centre in Turkey, was designed by its unique bloc design from the Canyon Valley, which is therefore named Canyon, and is located in the valley in the distance of 200 metres from the Central Minister of Kanyon.
In addition to the design of the hall, there is a large-scale exhibition site in the centre of the shopping center, which is unique to the outside, often performing special performances.
Because of the open platform design, it allows visitors to travel at each level to watch the activities carried out in the "Water" and have the impact of the transition perspective.
In the country, there is a business street in South China, known as the main forest-based slow-downs in China, which combines goods with the environment, and children's speech is perfect.
7000 square meters of green space, 3,000 square meters of surface water platform, a project consisting of 9 individual buildings, adjoining the airspace between the buildings, designing the entire bedroom, and taking the floor floor of France's alpine trees into a building, and creating a forest area.
Walking in the woods of the forest, like an unattended cave in the memory of the Elysmonds, the surrounding trees will build around, the grass, and the flowers represent, bringing people into a fully organic and vibrant forest.
It also re-enacted that the lake's well-being water business circle, plans for hundreds of businesses, plans to introduce more than 50 international top-level fleets, more than 100 international top-level brands and more than 500 brands abroad, resulting in a collection of service industries, the theme of which is unique commercial centres.
In addition, the water business environment also integrates the environment into the building, leading to the public transport of TOD, collecting goods, services, food, entertainment, education and movement into a community, leading them to enjoy a unique "water culture", to the enjoyment of goods and water, and to relax perfectly.
It can be seen as a whole that a part of the room has now been exposed to the discovery of this new urban business, while businessmen have pointed out that this, with consumer experience, will also lead to future urban development.
The current business circle is not only a collection of goods but more than a integration of art culture, an integrated site of the topic of creation, and also a responsibility for the urban population.
Therefore, in meeting the needs of consumers to eat a seasonal material, the greatest emphasis on the multi-stakeholder spirit of cultural art and living needs must be on the top of the future development of the business circle.
In the mountains of the country, the country's active northern coastal mountains, the northern coast, are close to the bridge, the world's commercial beauty, the border around the international capital, the first round of cards, and the close-up of international time.
It's a step-by-step.
The East Bank has a better procurement environment, and the East Bank is in the vicinity of South-South trade, which is unique to the four-level road transport systems leading to the West and the country.
(b) The gardening of the two-tier road and the Vanda-wide road has also been improved in the view of the site of the recording, the growth of about 300 acres [300 ha], the production of 40,000 square metres of land and the promotion of the South-South business environment;
And the lake Lake Lake Lakes, which is close to rejuvenates the first low-pressure water business round – the coastal water business circle, surrounded by nine square yards, the commercial districts, the open level, makes people more willing to stop, stay and enjoy the taste of the goods, rather than the people behind it quickly move forward and actually achieve "progressive purchases".
Today, commercial competition will only become more and more intense, and it is worth considering how to kill a blood route in the codification of a serious market and the glory of the "purchase sanctuary" in the hearts of future consumers.
A single divergence strategy is not far enough, only those who really put consumers in the heart, who are in urgent need of consumers, and those who want consumers to be able to laugh at the market that comes in a storm.
Of course, to the end, I want the most happy or rejuvenated people with such a good shopping experience and business circle, and no one can imagine today's prosperity.
Materials: Consumerism has a deep interest in covering real environmental prices
1682 million dollars, which is a 24-hour transaction for the consumption of pets during the "Twenty-first global festival" on 11 November 2017.
In particular, after the launch of the two 11s, a short three-minute transaction of catacombs would break into 100 million.6 minutes more than 200 billion dollars and 10 billion hours.
On that day, the total number of payments made by global consumers by payment of the asset was 148 million and 41 per cent more than last year's.
These consumptions will produce 8.12 million flow lists.
Whether it's a sky-cocking platform or a pay-out platform, it's all part of the Ariri group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that a single young person would come from a culture that created itself on November 11, which would be a collection of electricity and become a multi-stakeholder "Two 11" of the current phenomenon.
On 11 November 2009, Aribaba was the first to use the "smoothing of Christmas": no one spoke to you about love, so let's buy "single dogs" quickly.
As a result, it was unlikely that the transaction in the city of the diocese (formerly "the cat") would have broken down by $52 million, 10 times that of the daily transaction.
Since then, "Two 11" has become a promiscuous celebration of the purchases made by Aruba, from the beginning of a country's domestic salesman's self-sustainment, to the present day of the world's merchants, nine years ago, over 3200 times that year's "two 11 billion" transactions have been viewed as "Black Friday".
The windshield's two-tenths and a lot of electricians, of which the most powerful "Kitts".
"Kython" has its own shopping season "6.18", but there is no "two 11" impact this year, from 1 November to 11 November, to $1127 million.
And after "two 11" the next thing is the same "two 12" broken down, the New Year's buy-in period.
A new year has passed, waiting for the annual purchase of goods by Chinese consumers before spring, the purchase of goods by lovers, the consumption, will not be allowed.
Environmental problems resulting from time-consuming marine consumption have caused concern for professionals and institutions.
According to the New York daily TV report, the normal standard maintenance of each pack of 0.2 kilograms in the industry produces at least more than 300,000 tons of waste during this year's "Two 11" period.
The Director of the Green and Eastern Asian Pollution Control Project, Huwa, told the interior dialogue that this year only 160,000 tons of packaging will be produced of "two 11" bottles.
The National Post Office had published a report in 2016 that indicated the rapid amount of approximately 7.8 million items for the period "Bi11" (11-16 November 2015), using over 300 million packages, 99.22 million containers, 169.85 million cubic metres, and the length of the bridge could cover 425 square miles of Earth.
This year, the National Post Office is expected to have more than $150 million in the accelerated operation of the two 11s.
A director of the Boeing Centre in Beijing told New York City that the garbage that went on every day after "two 11" was more than 2000 tons and more than the treatment capacity of the heating station.
The company has already realized that environmental pollution caused by the fast-paced industry is unhindered.
Some companies, including Sünnn, have launched "two 11" quick-to-use re-use bottles of plastic, which can be reused as containers of goods and bags, but which are not high enough to be accepted by the consumer concerned.
Mao has also supported "green packaging" and "green stream".
It's got more than 68,000 "honests".
What kind of move would the Germans want to pay?
Cold side: Unexpected payment by the Department of War in Germany.
The micro-credit payments and the bills have moved the warfield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the occupation has not changed -- the Chinese, is it a globalization?
There's a place to pay for the baby. There's got to be a little letter to pay.
In accordance with the agreement of the German electronic payment servicer Wirecard, the payment of micro-supply was officially initiated by Germany this November, and was gradually published by businessmen within Europe.
The two 'old cities' resurfaced in Europe.
For all time, the payment of wealth and micro-enterprises has been high on the way to globalization.
In relation to the globalization of China's migration, the Council "Third-Third China's Ministry of Industry Study 2017" summaries to two types: one through strategic investment, expertise, input and support for foreign land movements.
It is through the consumption of Chinese tourists and the promotion of foreign trade services to foreign merchants, which will change the awareness and acceptance of foreign land payments to China.
It's true that Chinese people have to go to heaven.
China's economic development is rapid, as well as a large population base. China's tourism in Europe is one of the number of tourists.
But it is also determined that this time China's movement in Germany was unlikely to pay for the war.
The payment and payment of coins but the transfer of war sites to Europe, the position of competitors has not changed, the occupations have not changed — or the Chinese, is it also globalized?
A more open survey is that China's move is possible to pay for landfills in Europe's soil?
For example, in Germany.
"New sales of magic."
Al-Qaida: It is worth all the time or the motivation to announce the entry into military stores and warehouses when the 10 largest retailers enter the world.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first entity bookstore in West Asia and subsequently two libraries in Portland and Santiago.
In early 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and planned to have at least 8 stores by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that no-one-on-the-fly (Amazon Go) pilots would operate under the flag, that customers would not need a series of orders, and that they would not have to be booked, and that they would have been able to get the goods out of the market as soon as possible, and that the purchase would have been automatically removed from their Amazon account.
In the case of Amazon, for recent years it has been a very rare thing to do in the company store.
As CEOJev Bejos, in early 2007, stressed that it would not be easy to open an entity store unless the following four conditions were met:
We must be confident that this new opportunity will enable the shareholders to return their investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is important to the whole company;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be sure that in this market we have sufficient resources to make a difference in the face of customers.
The bookstores and warehouses are the most coveted category of two entities sales, as well as the first downside opponent after Amazon's revolt.
Amason announced the entry of the two entities into the military when it entered the world's ten largest retailers, and whether it was time or motivation it was worth it.
Amazon's practice, and the assurances in the equity letter?
The other side of the earth heard a similar voice. On October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Assembly in Zhaoqing, the President of the Board of Directors of Alabama made a speech on the subject.
He said: "Alibaba will no longer mention the term 'e-commerce' from the beginning of next year.
The period of pure electricity will soon end, and in the next decade, there will be no electronic commerce, instead of 'new sales'.
A new deal will be made under the line with material flows. "
For a time, the three words "new sales" were used as magic, often tied to the mouth.
But what does "new sales" really mean?
If it's just connected to the line below, it's not strange.
In 2016, eMarketer followed the largest of 180 electricity producers, estimated that the total sales of electricity amounted to about $2,000 million, with the largest 25 of which accounted for $1590 million.
Among the 25 families, 18 were traditional retailers who started operating on the line in the last five years (e.g. Messie, Nordstrom, Target, Gap etc.).
And the Aribaba Group is 283 million in the Sunni Chamber, and it has also been seen.
From a global perspective, retailers and electricians are turning from one channel to the entire retail system of entrepreneurs, electricians, mobiles and socialized media.
Is the "new sale" more a summary than a prospect for the future?
If not, what's the difference between the concept of "new sales"?
Maybe the key to the problem isn't online that won't be integrated with the bottom line, but it's how.
In the past 20 years, the price and ease of the electricity industry has been focused on prices and advantages, such as the rise of early retailers.
Depending on these two pain points, the electrician transferred high standardization products, such as books and CDs, from the line down to the line.
As the growth of consumption practices on the line and customer experience continued to increase, the electricity industry also became more attractive to other categories and began to increase efficiency.
" Using Internet thinking and technology to fully reform and upgrade the total number of existing social negotiators, it is said that the increasing demand for consumer consumption in China can be effectively met and the process of production, transport and service throughout the Internet has become more effective as a result of the widespread use of data."
Thus, the path of the electrician is the path of a light asset and a path of real revolving assets.
"light" means fixed assets, staffing, management processes without traditional retail size; "weight" means large input in terms of material flow and storage.
The change in the mode of flow guarantees the efficiency of the electricity industry.
According to information from the Government of China, Prime Minister Leek of the State Department presided over the holding of a permanent meeting of the State Department on 28 April, which considered the expansion of domestic consumption needs was a stable growth and a major structural initiative.
It was established that the relevant sectors would be required to draw up specific programmes on the basis of scientific assessment.

Further progress was made in facilitating the linkage and return of foreign passengers and in strict implementation of the law-making initiative to declare tax requirements.
(c) Develop a testing policy to support cross-border imports of electricity and to clean up the import chain of unreasonably costs;
To speed up the development of China's product promotion cards, support the development of the entity store, and achieve interaction under the line.
Normative market order, serious fraud, promotion of excellence.

On 18 January, Aribaba reconvened the high-performance dialogue between the electricity trader and announced a new "Internet + poverty-relief" model to facilitate the eradication of poverty and rural rehabilitation.
This was the following rural strategy, the launch of a rural boutique project, the rise of the agricultural poverty platform, the creation of the Aribabat poverty fund, and the re-commodation of the poverty-relief.
Poverty eradication is one of China's most important national strategies.
The total eradication of poverty in China has never been achieved in the past thousands of years.
"Electronic poverty is a new innovation initiative for poverty eradication, which is aimed at improving poverty and improving poverty eradication.
It is centrally important and noted that the Internet can play a role in facilitating the eradication of poverty, improving the eradication of poverty, improving the eradication of poverty, and enabling agricultural products to leave villages through the Internet. "
As a result, Ari had introduced rural strategies early in 2014 to calculate and globalize large data gaps and be listed as a three-year core strategy for the future 20 years.
In the same year, Ari started a rural boutique project, recruiting "Little II" in rural areas, bringing farmers to poverty through the electricity business.
In 2017, Ari worked with the business sector to promote agricultural poverty, which is now estimated at a total of 13 provinces in the country and 120 in the country.
There are 2118 villages in the Ali Platform.
Nearly 400 people attended the province ' s poverty zone, 33 attended by 13 countries.
In 2017, the national budget sales totalled $11.2 billion in the country's budget at the country's retailing platform in Aruba.
Courage was expressed that, in the face of a country strategy to combat poverty, Ari had been thinking about how to use technology for the Arian economy, large data and innovation, such as the blind, and a new way to get out of poverty.
Among them, the village was the main platform for the removal of poverty by the Ali-Estros, and a direct Internet-based channel for the release of the link between poverty and poverty.
A joint support for agricultural crops and small loans is carried out in rural and rural areas.
In 2017, in the 832 national poor areas, there were 795 gold mines serving them, providing them with easy payment and credit services.
Food birds resolve stocks and streams of matter, pets are responsible for sales, and the great data from Ali-i-i-kuns guide agricultural production, further improve supply standards for agricultural products, quality and market competitiveness.
The development of the electricity industry, not only needs products, sales routes, industrial planning, but also needs people.
Ali, through the University of Quebec, has launched an electric business course to standardize agricultural transmission, qualityization and measurable cultivation methods to achieve a combination of "poverty-sustainment" to make farmers sustainable.
These courses have covered about 92 per cent of national poverty levels.
And the "public interest rate, business means" escapes poverty, and it also ensures that Ali does "very poor".
The President of the Board of Directors of the Arab Republic stated that poverty eradication should be divided into poverty eradication, eradication and a three-phase phase.
Poverty is to give people fish, to remove poverty is to give them fish, and to make them a "fishing" for farmers, so that farmers can eat fish.
The industry's driven by electricity is the production of fish.
In terms of industrial poverty, Ali, in cooperation with Shilo River, has been promoted by the relevant sectors as an example of national copying.
Ary's efforts to eradicate poverty have also been approved by the decision-making level.
The electricity business represented by Aribaba has been sent to ensure increased growth of farmers through online channels.
Some small and medium-sized civil servants were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share experiences in the eradication of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme China Office has been working with villages in the field of electricity-producing industries, such as Aung.

She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issue — the issue of globalization and its use, as well as the phase of globalization.
Many feel that globalization has ceased, and many developed and developing countries differ in their attitude toward globalization in the new phase, as opposed to the model.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what is the restriction of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The restrictions imposed on the economic environment are the result of the change in globalization.

The post-market upgrade has become the topic of the new retail sector, where is the new brand?
"In 2018, we will enter the country quickly, before spring in Beijing, and over the sea, the state will start a large store."
At the second new round of sale, CEO was born on 10 March 2018.
" Since 2018, the box has been not only a generation electrician but also a life-style electrician that meets the needs of the consumer.
Under the core model line is flow, experience, and real sales on the line."
Unlike traditional supermarkets, supermarkets, boxing is a popular "net red shop" in many consumers' eyes, even among middle-class agencies that have opened the concept of "boxroom".
On-line power stations and retailers have different advantages, but consumers are on several channels, so both parties are trying to complete the channel model.
In industry, it is believed that in the large context of consumer upgrades, the gatekeepers of the "class horse" of 2018 will be increasing.
In the new year, the market in retail is becoming more and more innovative.
"For example, the mode of operation combined under the line drew the consumer's eyes, and the life-changing supermarkets that are open everywhere are called good. "
"But these relationships are more and less useful, and you finally realize that you have brought a good experience to the consumer, and I've tried to buy them. "
It appears that in the new retail environment, the consumer custom has changed and the purchase demand has changed.
In fact, the line is broken, the line is broken, the line is broken, the line is broken, and the line is now joined, because the consumer is no longer separated from the line.
The share of capital in the struggle to satisfy the current demand for new nuclear fuel for life in the supermarket.
The analysis suggests that the current competition for new brands in one city has not yet reached the border of the Red Sea, and that there are still many opportunities and space in the market.
The different types of industry will lead to a multi-manufactured development status for new retail exchanges.
The Economic Strategic Research Institute for the Central Bank of China's Association for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is the annual development report of the Chinese electric operator in Myanmar, has addressed a problem for all.

Helps you avoid the company becoming the next priority
Amy Erett once wanted to see the happiness of the entrepreneurial investigators in her electronic business, but the investigation had no effect.
The response received is often inaccurate, useless, even worse, and misleading.
Even though she has committed herself to adopting an anonymous form, some employees still do not believe in this process.
Edret, who is responsible for managing 75 old-fashioned electronic business supplies, said that "the lack of coherence and objectivity in response."
So she called for extra help.
A number of new human resources, such as the spring of rain, were created to help companies understand the feelings of workers.
They build and authorize software dedicated to measuring the participation of employees, thus enabling companies to carry out a rapid voluntary test for specific groups and groups of population, providing the employee with identification and complaint lines and, in some cases, allowing the reporters to report directly to the Board of Directors.
"Now, you can track your health with tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit from the company?"
Erett indicated that within three years she had received more insights into the thinking and feelings of staff members using Glint.
In addition to the rapid investigation and voluntary investigation of the specific team, Glint also provided a map of the company, which of the most complaint units, which of the managers' approvals were low, and one point was that it enabled her to understand why.
The companies began to realize that they had to master the company's career culture in order to be the next priority. A blog article describing the environment of harassment was published prior to the pre-priority workers who were punished by the company, and then their priority was to be put into confusion.
For companies such as Glint, the company's desire for supervision is an endless business of money.
Based on data from the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, global governance, regulatory and regulatory value by 2020 may exceed $1187 billion.
Convercent of the first creative enterprise in Darfur, Colorado, was committed to helping companies to prevent and detect wrong acts, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this regard during the earlier year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including pets, Microsoft and Tessra.
Prioritize the recent contract to become a client.
Like Glint, Convercent can send a well-designed "scientific" survey, and actually collect confidential responses and look at the map of its area of question.
Convercent also provides anonymous telecommunications hotline to inform employees of the misconduct.
If the President is contacted, the complaint will be directly taken into the Board of Directors.
The founder and chief executive of the Convercent said: "Although the Tribunal has seized the authority of the regulatory body,
If a company has been found to be ill-treated or to show misconduct against employees, even if the regulatory body is not involved, it may also face consumer resistance, and the high consequences of the loss of workers and involvement in proceedings are expressed by Küllan.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant with over 500 locations and over 25,000 registered employees, which has been used for over a year to ensure that workers understand the working guidelines and working procedures and provide easy access to the headquarters of the associated company.
Before that, if the staff member wishes to report issues, he must find the company ' s telephone number or e-mail, submit formal complaints, and hope that the Headquarters will be able to address it seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as the legal adviser to Ruby Tuesday, James Witrano, said that he did not think that there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
But now, using the Convercent, the company can find and solve problems that are unknown to the city or state, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair payroll.
"I can be closer to 360 degrees in full knowledge of work experience," said Wittrano, who was responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We're protecting our shareholders from employment proceedings. "
Küngland stated that, following the closure of security information from the Angolan accounting company, companies began to give greater attention to morals, values and employee employment since 2002.
But as soon as the social media entered their own world, the companies realized that they could not prevent their explosives from being spread online on the virus.
"Before we use technology monitoring behavior, people view hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent both provided their software as services and the regular costs of collecting products for companies.
Such business models and business opportunities are supported by risk investors, which have been supported by the two primary entrepreneurs.
In 2 months, Convercent collected funds from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and increased its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10,000 from Bessemer Venture Partners, totalling $6 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, cultural and risk investments, these investments will hardly surprise people.
More and more studies have shown that the expectations of workers today are higher than they had before.
In the highly competitive markets such as Hong Kong, high-paying and interesting projects are just a joke.
Staff members wish to feel accepted, respected, and feel their time spent on a company with an active mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voice is heard and their work is useful, they will be more committed to making the company successful," LinkedIn, Vice-President of the Global Welfare and Industrial Test, Nina McCartney.
Investors are well informed when their investment group shows good performance; the company is good when it is loyal and respectful to employees.
If the third-party analysis tool undertakes to increase the integrity and integrity of employees, they will also find insufficient financial support.
The cultural expert at the workplace said that data on staff employment were very important.
However, these data are of no use unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company requests workers to offer feedback, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change is slow or there is no progress, it may lead to disappointment, and it may lead to the withdrawal of employees from the company.
Russell Lasser Rass, the consultant of the Cott International Business Management Company, said: "If you want to look for 4,000 recommendations, you need to be prepared to engage in 4,000 dialogues." He has seen errors that some companies have over-depend on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow it all the time, the employee will think, 'Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why do I care?"
Edret said that Madison Reed was now conducting a monthly staff survey that had been able to take action on the Glint report on that day.
After collecting feedback on their feedback on decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to address the problem through the regrouping internal team to increase communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is receiving new views on its employees, and they long to see that they wish to be able to transform into a sector that is well-known to be high-fashioned and better preserved.
"If you're not committed to creating a transparent culture, you'll lose people," said Wittrano.
"If you lose someone, you'll lose your client.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company."

NCAA cancels the training twice a day and prolongs the training period for the white team.
At 11:00 a.m., a group of football team members from the University of Los Angeles, California, spoke out in a loudspeaker near the new campus.
Some of the players have already removed the movement belt and revealed that the first day of the training camp was trying to train the back of the body.
For a large part of the team, it's a few minutes of rest.
The participants in the summer course will return to their final exams after three hours of training, and the next morning at 6:30 a.m. We will return to Wasserman at the Football Centre.
"The next three days is a match with these guys," said the coach Jim Mora on Tuesday.
NCAA cancels two daily exercises (to reduce the load of light ballers), but actually prolongs their training days - at least before the end of Friday.
That's why the first three trainings at the University of Los Angeles, California, were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. in order to adjust the time schedule that the ballers have already completed.
From the elimination of two training days to more than one day, the team of mice trained about a week before the previous season, and Mora was first trained in the six season of Westwood.
They planned to start 18 training courses from August 20 and then to start an official race for agricultural workers in the capital state of Chad in September.
Mora said that he supported the adjustment of the rules of NCAA, although this would also increase the activity of the players.
"For three or four days, we will provide them with great training, very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed, they're training, they're all great kids.
I thought on Saturday, we'd have more time, really great."
At the end of the course, the University of Los Angeles, California, will stop training. Taking into account the nearby parking lot and Luskin Center's clear line, this is not an easy task.
But Mora admits that once these rooms are in the middle of the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really worrying problem, thinking that someone might rent a room and sit in the room and that's not a good idea.
If you have a training tape, it's very good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in the 8th parking lot.
We'll use existing resources and do the best we can.
I won't worry too much about it.
We've made a plan."

The book of face-to-face checks will be carried out against false news.
On Thursday, the book of Faces claims that more potentially malicious drama articles will be sent to the Third-Party Inspection Authority and show the results of the investigation. The world's largest online social networking network is trying to combat what is called the fake news.
In its statement on its website, the Facebook company indicated that the facebook would start using updated machines to study the possible maladies and send them to the actual verifier and could show the actual verification results below the original.
The book has been criticized as one of the main sources of propaganda known as fake news, and many believe that facebooks have affected the 2016 presidential election of the United States.
The issue was also an important political issue in Europe, and before the presidential elections in France in May, the electors had suffered a wide range of false stories, and Germany had first adopted support for a penalty plan before the September elections and would be punished if the social media network failed to eliminate hatred in a timely manner.
In a separate statement made by Germany on Thursday, France, the Netherlands and Germany are launching a new actual verification test.
In a blog, the Facebook news director, Rasara Su, said: "In addition to the questions raised by third-party verifiers, there is a need for more background to help them make wise decisions about what they read and share.
She added that the face book would continue to test its " relevant articles " function and to make other changes to its content in order to reduce false news.
Create a drawing: The story of England's castle
In recent years, the small Scottish castle has become the main source of printed music videos, and once it has become the shelter of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher for the 1970s.
However, Scotney saw a 700-year-old motion history at the convenient location of the Bay of Belo, Kent, and is now a source of inspiration written by Jamie Rhodes (Jamie Rhodes) (a special love for the historical document, keeping his head cut off by the Jacks).
"You can see the signs of ancient times 300 years ago, and I find this very beautiful," he said.
"What kind of personal distinction can make this letter fall in my hand?"
Between the Middle Ages and the era of Edward, "An English castle" read the book to families living in Scotland, each of which is different from that of future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book to be the original material of the archives: he also wrote "the teeth and other stories of the dead in 2014", a book published by the British Library, a work completed by him with a creative spirit that is beyond control.
He said: "When I see the impression that the text is left behind, I can't stop the writing movement of my own, which was written by a two-year-old agent working for the Jacobi team in the 18th century."
"That's his finger!
And the message's always smells like a piece of smoke, because then you need some light.
For us, 300 years later, it makes people feel like they are with us.
Oh, I like the text of the file!"
For those who have been driven by old papers, it seems that they can have the support of the British National Commission on Trust and Art and live in the castle for nearly four months (“in fact, my stay is a little longer”), and that doesn't seem to be true.
Rose spent several days visiting Victoria's "New" castle, reopening the archives, researching many treasures and gambling in the garden, such as the caverns on the wall, and the bottles of several centuries in the wall.
He slowly conversed with the miners and the miners in the old castle, sometimes in the garden, with artists in his books.
And then at night, he's gonna "drink some whiskey, then write."
The history of Scotland's secret history is still unclear, since the National Trust Organization of the United Kingdom entered into full entry only after the death of Elizabeth Hessie, the last successor.
Ten years later, when Rose arrived, the staff began handling the file, he described them as "the people of the hundred years ago, "Oh, put it in the building."
The newspaper, a letter from the British Empire, described the map of the country's territory: "You would think the land dispute would be boring," said Rose, but two families would be very much affected by a white tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work were from the beginning, and later came to a broader extent to study the history of England, including "the Workers" (The Laborer), which was a clue to a man who left the new castle to participate in the agricultural induction of 1381.
The story of "Kent's family and Sussex's " (Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex) recorded a riot in the castle in 1380."
"Agricultural farming begins in that area, and I think it's a good place to start.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as "The Priest" (The Priest), which tells the Darrell family about a seven-year story hidden by a Jesuit priest during the British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, the owner of the story, was 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was considered to have performed funerals for himself by means of stone-filled mats (his tomb was discovered several years later) .
"The Darrells" is the most popular Scotney castle family: "These men seem helpless, always borrowing money and buying things they can't afford.
In the second century, men of Darrell were able to solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women, and I think they should be a small group of British men and understand how to seek women. "
As he finished his mission in the castle, Rose began looking for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a painting in the wilderness of Finland for two weeks, which was about "El?m?"nm?ki", a 20th-century early hospital, and then it was abandoned slowly.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
"I'm sorry to leave," he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I've got to face up to the reality of the cake.'
According to the newsmagazines, the intelligence team's headquarters is located on the shores of the Sea, and the pilots are implementing the Deputy President's Vampire for Inter-Agency Communication.
So who's the richest member of the global energy company?
Last year, a prominent PFC energy company issued a strong list of 50 high-quality city energy companies in 2011, with US oil gas producer Ekson with $40.6 million in value of the U.S. oil chain, followed by China's oil and Dutch royal belts.
In this list of PFCs, the oil had been questioned twice in 2007 and 2009, and the other year the lead was occupied by Ekson.
Among the 50 strong lists in 2011 were three companies from within China, with the exception of China ' s oil category 2, as well as China ' s 9 oil mining and China's 15th oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, although the current oil price was far higher than four years ago, PFC energy company CEO noted that there were many reasons for the low value of the general market, particularly the decline in gas prices in North America, and the low life expectancy in the global stock market.
According to The New York Times, the recontamination of the weather from the 16-day period and the surrounding areas increased to 19-day, with the "explosive" on the AQI in the north of the river.
United States of America Amend Green Card Provisions
The media called for President Donald Tranp's statement that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend the Green Card.
The plan aims to reduce legitimate migrants to 50,000 persons per year, with temporary work visas and family visa applications being subject to stricter restrictions.
The new provision is submitted by the Communist Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the Chambers.
The U.S. media quoted Tranpin as saying, "This law would reduce poverty and raise wages and provide millions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the United States' green card to other national citizens.
The Act will replace the current programme to reduce bond-based migrants.
This new application process is conducive to speaking in English, with financial support and with an applicant with an enabling skills for economic development. "

In order to build an environment for the optimization area, South America was built, and in the near future, the South Pacific Institute of Smoking (Sub-corporate) organized the "636 "Volume Service Team" on the "Wilding Forests, Love Houses" environmental protection activities.
The activities have not only been supported by the work of the Department of the Whole of the Department of Tobacco and have also attracted the Department of Retirement, one of the employees and one of the members of the staff involved in environmental practices, three-year-olds' heart-to-child collaboration, the mining and cleaning of garbage, and the construction of the South American power.
This volunteer service activity is designed to protect South-South perspective resources and promote the concept of volunteer services "love others, love society, love of nature" as well as to convey to the next generation the idea of voluntary services.
Since the establishment of the "636 " Voluntary Service Team, 16 members have been members of the Joint Development Committee since the beginning of April of this year, who have previously conducted a series of voluntary service activities, such as the smoking of low-sales customers, and the smoking of agricultural remedies, and the desperate contribution of Japan, have become a volunteer volunteer army with a heart-to-powered message.
In the eyes of journalists who regularly report on the project, the post-Creation Section has already become the potential of the next Lyndane.
According to the Department of Public Information, the Inter-Americans had a friendly consultation on 20 December in the South Sea on the successful completion of the transfer of unmanned submarines.
In recent years, Kongong, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have played a major role in the field of human engineering (AI).
The sex machine's really excited, but we should be careful.
A new technical development report has been issued in the area of sexual organs when you think it will not be more unusual in 2017.
Yes.
Now the sex machine is a big deal.
Recently, the FRF (FRR) issued a report that looked forward to the development of the sex machine in the next five to ten years.
According to Professor of Technology and Human Wisdom at the University of Field, Mr. Noel, co-founder of the FRR?
Customers can choose the color of the eye of the machine, the shape of the skin and the type of the finger.
When Shaki released the new report, she said, "People are laughing at the back, but the big companies have actually launched a lot of sexual instruments, and we will see more."
Modern love plants have become machines from airborne evaporation, they have pellets, they are warm, and they are especially used in the use of human intelligence.
Users can also "determine" their machines to satisfy their own tastes, from the eye color, to the shape of the needle or color can be chosen.
But it's even more disturbing that a lot of machines with "personality" will make it look much better.
Modern love has developed into a machine that has a spinal cord.
For example, RealBotix machines can be defined on the basis of characteristics that the user considers attractive, such as shame.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex machines developed by True Company, which predictively define personality characteristics, including a bit of a shy "floating falsifier" and a "greeding on adventure".
"Roxxxy Gold machine has the same personality as you can," True Company's website has fun for this.
So she loves you, she hates you.
She had a little passion for those days, just like normal people!
She can cry, she can talk, and she can't say "sex"!"
The excitement of the sexual organs has led to much insecurity — not only replacing true human relations — but also the female characteristics of the calf and the most disturbing sign of rape on the part of Pharaoh.
True Company puts Roxxxy on its website more exciting than men.
"Why can't a man have Roxxity if a woman has a shock?"
However, these sexual organs are not just a mere object, nor are they just a sexual instrument.
Their appearances and their growing knowledge point to more darker and deeper aspects of our culture: escape from perfect gender equality and move towards a more choice of sex.
Of course, most men do not have sexual instruments, and although the FRR notes that sexual instruments are increasingly welcome, they are still on the side of consumer culture.
But things that come from the opposite direction can make us see the process of our times.
Many people were not prejudiced or aggressive until the free market gave them a chance to do so.
These specific sexual organs were at a time when the rights of a global woman were threatened, and there was another president who accused women of sexual violence, which was not consistent.
The television drama "for women's story" is not a real picture, it's not about the body that's attached, it's not about the eyes of the two who's been buried, it's about the real idea.
The Republic of Chile is a leap, but it doesn't seem far away now.
The aim of these sexual organs is to create the most real woman in the world at the expense of technology (even though the proportion of sex stars).
The Creator of these machines wants them to have human touch and imitate the real human movement.
But frankly, their "individual" does not represent real women.
They can't split up, they can't go out.
They have no support agencies nor follow-up stories, absolutely no independence, nor any possible defeat of full-time slavery illusions.
In other words, they're curious slaves.
Or according to the 2017 usual statement: for women.
In ancient times, a Chinese forces for the protection of human beings and for the war of death in the long known cities of the world with wild beasts.
"Run, brother" has been recorded for the last time in the fourth quarter, "run a man" has received on May 30th evening news, a brief interview of netizens from "tutor" in the "run" to "devil angels" and "devil angels" in the "dangerous" group, and the "dangerous man" smile, and the impression of "a hundred-stars" to the audience is constantly changing.
"At the show, the same thing I won't do, to keep up-to-date."
The great success of Tranmp?
Mitt Romney becomes a regular shadow.
Political discrimination has led to two extreme divisions of American voters, and from a microview, it has ruined American families and communities.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, U.S. newspapers were filled with commentaries on how to respond to the fear of elected Tranquus relatives.
We usually think that we're doing our best to break our "extremely dust."
Less than a few comments were made about the strength of Tranp to unite the family.
I mentioned this because of my sister, a left-wing woman living in Chicago, who had been staying with our family for a long time, and he was coming to New York this week.
She reminded me that solidarity and mutual opposition could have a powerful effect.
Because of working with Tranmpu in the White House, she knew all the people she knew, including those of the political parties who had been fighting for decades, now suddenly and strangely standing on the same front line.
It's a good thing if you're all on the table, but I'm surprised that from a broader point of view, it's going to create a serious risk.
Although the left-hand side has been hit by the dragonfly of Tranp, he has led us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and "Tranpp," we are referring to the possibility of worrying, that some day his weirdness might stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scene, which, in general, "normalization" is a relationship with the right-wing party, which was once opposed to the standards of the President, and now suddenly seems to be a legitimate symbol.
I have recently found some strange memories of Met? Romni's crazy memory: the taxes on dogs on cars, 14% (but at least we know his tax declaration) are relatively small compared to Tranton, and these two moving crimes seem to be relatively small.
After the Tranquo era, the next joint party candidate needed only reasonable improvement in his ability to achieve an unestimated improvement.
When my sister lived in town, we took the children to the New York Park Roof, which is the largest round of the New York Park Managers, and if you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets are your most consumer value in this city.
The voice of the tree is as large as the raccoon, and the central tower is designed for a glass of glass, and all the small and animal heads are turned around, and the horror and danger are looking at their shoulders, and the sound of the bells as loud music is alarmed.
Too many traditional cities are disappointed: from the perspective of the high walls, the sunline has become too familiar to provide too much incentives, and the reality of the city has not given rise to dreams.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I've found this Swiss little house is not actually Switzerland, but it's a place in the old Swiss Cottage bar, and I can't remember it, but near a crossing bridge in northern London.
However, the rotation of the central park continues to be an amazing experience for two 2-year-old children, an 11-year-old child, and two 40-year-old girls, each of whom enjoys a great time.
If I could evaluate the rotation of the tree, I'd be satisfied with it, but fortunately no one would ask.
But this week I was asked to make a five-star assessment of my transaction before the credit card was signed.
In the coffee shop on my street corner, too, you can also choose 15% of the cost, which is to buy things on the table.
The effect of doing so is not only to reduce the rate that it should be a medium-sized transaction but also to force the service provider to add personal factors to situations that are not necessary.
The poor woman in this hundred store was so sorry, and I was tired, and the credit card transaction was worth five stars.

Can milk, milk products and chocolate help alleviate infectious diseases (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like your system's smell.
A new study, however, shows that eating foods containing meat-containing proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the related symptoms of pathogens.
This disease has a life-threatening effect on approximately 130 million Americans and some 300 million British people, leading to nausea and vomiting, frequent or bleeding, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually recommend that patients avoid exposure to food and milk products to relieve their symptoms, but researchers found that key protein protein acids help to promote the growth of immunization cells, which can enhance the endurance of the pathogens.
Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immunization cells will be patrolled in the path and will ensure that harmful microorganisms in the food will not penetrate the body.
Balances between cells caused by infectious diseases and cells that promote tolerance and protect the body from harming vulnerable organizations of all kinds.
If the balance is too high for cancer, it is likely to cause infectious diseases.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunization emerges from a small white mouse containing special bacteria.
The enzymes need to form a cell's surface of coloric acid (one of the components of protein)
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a group of bacteria (Royian fungi, which is a normal part of microbiological groups) and a link between the development of cells that can contribute to endurance.
The number of whites in the diet is increasing, and their immune cells are increasing.
He suggested that if humans use the same methods, the combination of pathogenic acids and fatty acids could create a more tolerant and less sensitive pathological environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganawas studied a patient immune cell when she found that a group of microorganisms had this cell, but the same group of bacteria had not been fed.
She suspects that this difference is related to the microorganisms of the white mouse (usually living in the fungi, viruses and fungi) group.
There are 6 types of bacteria in the microorganisms that have immunized cells, but there are no white cells in the immunized cells.
Small whites grow in the non-movable environment, so they lack microorganisms, and cannot develop such immunization cells, and the presence of pathogens creates immunization cells.
In order to understand how the immune system is affected, researchers develop pathogens in the fluids and then transfer a small amount of non-cellular fluid to unaccompanied immunosuppressed cells separated from small white rats.
Immunization cells should be developed into strong cells.
When the active substance is purified from the liquid, it can prove that the active substance is a subproduct of colouric acid, called ion-3-beta.
The number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent after the number of colourings in the small white cells has been repeated, but the number of cells decreased by half when the color of the acid levels decreased.
Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same cells that promote endurance, and most of us have pathogens in our pathogens.
Whether human beings can develop the cell-based protein-subproducts from the pathogens in the body, as in the experiment, and are not yet known, but there are genetic defects associated with coloric acid-related diseases in patients with pathogens.
She said, "The development of these cells may be the result of what we want, because they can control the immune response in the inside of the cell.
It can be said that the high-level phytosanitary acid that exists in the pathogens may lead to an increase in the number of bacteria.
José Murino thinks Manni's signed "Scientific" Nemania Mattic.
On Wednesday night, following the first time that Némania Matticy had opened up against the conflict in Sampore, Murino found out that a middle-class "scientific" player had signed Mannio.
Mattitch came from Chelsea, signed at $40,000, and won Paul Bogueba's and Andreas Perera's gold medal in the last quarter of the final season of the European summit in Dublin before the King Madrid.
However, during the first cycle of Asia in the Brussian season, the status of the Matitch game was severely impaired, and only 45 minutes of time was completed, and Murinio recognized the need for improvement before the summer of the British superseding season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and the way of thinking -- he's thinking about football," said Murino.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
At the beginning of this season, Murino began to organize his lead contest, and just like Matticy, new footballers, Victor Linderov and Romelo Lukaku started the game at the Enjewa Sports Centre.
The independent newspaper of this week, Murinoo still wanted to introduce three gambling players again, but he insisted that the club "work is great", and in his heart were four top players, and the club had introduced three of them.
"The club introduced three of them, and I am very grateful. "He added.
"If the club could bring in all four players, I'd be happier, but they've made a lot of effort for me."
If China didn't build this type of ship, would it fall?
With the advance of the construction plans of new protective vessels by the United States of America and the latest programme of the U.S. F.G., which had been announced by the United States of America in the course of one night, Japan had become concerned about the concerns of the military in the wake of two new safeguards in the 2018 defence budget, which led to the eventual collapse of the Japanese DEX guard plan and the latest programme of the United States of America's FFG guard plan had recently been published.
As the latest 054A guardships were built at the end of 2017, there were more than 29 high-level 054A guardships, and the total number of 053H guard vessels was close to the total of the 053H series, and from the first 054A to the present period of the 2006 construction of the 054A were 12 years long, even in the world, the construction of such a large number of high-powered general protective vessels, with the exception of China, and only the United States of America, which was built in the seventh and 80th centuries.
And why the construction of so many 054A is so simple, that is practical, useful, and complemented by many years' marine forces.
054A has been awarded higher sexual values and good fighting force for many years by the Chinese Navy, with a volume of about 4,000 tons of water, with a volume of 76 mm main, 32 units of RF-16 and 8 anti-Semit shells fired, 8 hits 83 and a vertical-9 helicopter, although the design of a vessel was earlier than it was in 2006, but it is still not too bad, and can reach the level in the world's range.
However, this is a type of vessel designed in the early 21st century, which is placed on the one side, and its power system and electronic radar equipment have been very different from the present world's main protective vessel, as Europe's same type of protective vessels have been equipped with full power to move forward, with small multi-functions to control Péreda, with large-scale helicopters, and with the development of new types.
So say how China's new protective vessel should develop, which is directly linked to its future position and our strategic approach to the Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be entirely a Blue Sea Army, and the future will also be a journey to the oceans, with rapid deployment of areas of interest-related interest in China, demonstrating the presence of force and, where necessary, having a strong fight to ensure that China's short-term interests in the region are not damaged, so that the new wave will lead to a massive and far-reaching development.
Looking again at the situation in the future Chinese Navy series, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the United States Navy, except for the necessary near-sea defence ships, other major ships will be formed as a group of pilots or as a group of two-wheeled combatants, as necessary.
The role of the new protective vessel in the future fleets should serve as an anti-potential position in the Middle and Middle-West regions, and in the fight against two-phase vessels as a protective vessel, so that, in the light of such needs, the new type-protection vessels must have a strong anti-opportunity and good medium-sized space capacity.
On the basis of the above-mentioned position, there can be a tremendous picture of the future country's probationary vessel.
For the first time, the amount of water for the current type 054A protective vessel would be significantly increased, estimated to be about 5000 to 6000 tonnes; the power system would use a QC280-improvement system, with a maximum speed of approximately 30 seconds; and a maximum speed would also be significantly increased; for the installation of 76-mm and 1130-millimeter-squares, an additional 10-pound launch system, with a 32-48-pound and a total of 16-particles, would be fitted with an 8-16-m-ray system for the launch of the new aircraft; the engine and the system would also be increased, with two 10-wheels of fuel engines; and a four-phares of machines; and the size of the size of the machine, according to the size of the size of the machine A.
The overall level of a new type of protective vessel will reach a current global standard, even if it is relatively small in comparison with the United States' FFG.
The concept of the above is, of course, only the idea of a new type of protective vessel in the country, but let us look forward to the time when we can only wait for a new type of protective vessel to fall down.

China's family debt is closer to the United States than it's more terrible to buy a house?
In recent years, what changes have everyone been discussing in the area policy, and are they going to break down the property policy? The land policy for the topic will not allow the price to decline?
However, when we were concerned about the price of property, the macroeconomic controls, the future trends of the real estate markets, the "People's newspaper" was reprinted, and the last time we specifically discussed the "People's newspaper" comments on the determination of property controls, and now the "People's newspaper" statement was a more serious matter than the purchase of housing, which is even if you buy a house and you have to pay?
Today, we're going to talk about more serious housing issues: loans.
I. A growing debt crisis in China
According to data published in the National Institute for Finance and Development, the National Institute of China, the National Institute for Finance and Development, the National Institute for the Development and Development of China, issued a three-week report on the "Third-Third-China Debt Debt Process" that the population sector continues to increase trends from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, with a 1.3 per cent increase in the first three quarter of 2017.
The debt of the housing sector in the entire economy is greater than that of the entire entity economy, and the rate of inflation is faster.
The study showed that China's family's debt to financial institutions was the master of consumer loans, which accounted for about 2/3 residents, approximately 2 times operating loans.
Of these, the average long-term loans for housing loans amount to approximately eight in the consumer loan, but the growth rate of short-term consumer loans is faster than the medium-term loan.
In addition, China’s family debt rate has only been recorded by the family sector as a total of loans received from financial institutions, while China’s family also has a number of civil loans, including loans to close friends, which are large-scale debt.
In view of such data, there is a lack of evidence that, according to statistics from the Finnish Financial Institute, China's population is only 3 per cent in 1996 and only 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 there has been a rapid growth rate, which has doubled for a short period of six years, reaching 36.4 per cent. The population population density has reached 48.6 per cent by the third quarter of 2017.
We have issued a cross-border 9-country investigation report for almost a thousand visitors compared to one data, which was published by the Bank last May last year.
The mission of this report is for young people of 9 countries "tillion generation" (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, 80,90 young people in China had 70 per cent of their housing capacity, and two times the United States level (35 per cent) of their foreign leadership (46 per cent).
These data tell us a very possible problem, which is that the biggest possible "grain cow" in China is still being estimated to be in debt compared to the unspoiled house.
Second, why is the debt crisis the most serious issue?
As we have discussed before, although we have always said that China's premises are higher, but in comparison with other countries in the world, China's housing levels are actually quite high, so do I fear that you will still have loans to ask many of your friends now?
We look at the world-wide real estate market, and China's real estate market, because of slowing down later, in addition to what we have said, has not yet experienced a major real estate crisis, but the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008 is the United States of America's real estate crisis.
The causes of the U.S. property crisis are attributed to two rooms: beautiful and beautiful premises.
At the time in the gold era of the United States, the real estate company sold the house for a very low-primary sale to the low-income population of the United States at the time, while the real estate market was also a favor to the United States, but it was not long expected that as the United States economy had stopped its growth, the income of the buyers decreased, resulting in a large number of family consumption losses.
However, while the United States was a component of the United States family assets and property assets, the United States' low income groups were almost all households' assets, while most of the former high income groups were financial assets, resulting in a higher debt in the United States of America than in the poor.
A serious fact is that these people were all houses that were bought in a better time of economic life, so the payment of money was also calculated with their better income, and when the income came to decline, the pressure of the premises was not only reduced because some of the loans had increased, so that the issue of property of these American families was so gradually transformed into a crisis of property.
As a result, there was a decline in the price of the rental property, which led to a further decline in the price of the rental property in the region, resulting in a negative turn of prices, which led to a fall in the price of the premises, which led to a fall in the price of the premises, which led to a fall in the price of some of the houses, when the increasing number of buyers discovered that their house value was even lower than their own loans, resulting in more people to stop the continuation of the rent and more damage.
Thus, a huge evil cycle is formed:
"Economic inconsistencies -- income fluctuations -- some people still have no housing loans -- bank's low cost of selling low-cost housing -- more people stop borrowing -- bank's selling --
Moreover, the question is, since the price of the house is constantly falling, you are no longer obliged to stop lending the house to the bank after it has been sold. If the bank has not yet received the money you owe to the bank, then you still need to receive the money, simply assume that you have bought a set of $600,000, $24 million at the time of the price of the house. When the price of the house falls to that house only 20 million, you will no longer lend the bank to the bank, after the bank has sold the house, you will not only lose your own $600,000, and you will lose the bank 400 million debt, and you will still have to receive the money.
Thus, under such a one-off cycle, the United States' economic downturn is falling, ultimately leading to the financial crisis in the United States in 2008.
Thus, the level of family debt in China at the present stage reached 46.8 per cent of the high level of family debt is a problem of a very need for warnings, which is currently seen as being less than the level of developed countries, but the root causes of the problem have begun to arise, and since last year, it is a very clear conviction that if the family debt rate continues to increase, there will be a great risk of serious financial risk.
As a result, houses were used, not to be used, but to be used as a place of refuge, and the country was more rapidly creating a multi-topic supply, multi-channel security, procurement and reorganization measures, and further understanding of potential risks.
For our individual families, it is imperative to give up property investment and to do so as much as possible when buying houses and to avoid overloading their families, and only a reasonable assessment of their income and liabilities is a healthy family rich development path.

According to the military records published in the journal "Times", last month the White House decided to carry a marine army helicopter to South-Westphalia for the tremendous glory of the American manufacturing industry, with an amount of up to $24,000.
Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as the Marine Army War I) was an important demonstration of the United States project construction activities on July 17th.
President Donald Tranp, Vice-President Mike Vance and senior officials of the White House have been watching the production of products from all 50 states.
The exhibit has a helicopter made from the state of Connegie, a train from Maine, a fire-fighting vehicle from Wisconsin and a train from Mississippi.
According to the record of the first HMX-1 Air Force Force Air Force Air Force (HMX-1) operating the helicopter, the White Army Office requested that the helicopter be present at regular orders (FRAGO) only 36 hours before the helicopter landing in the South Pole to participate in this "special" activity.
One day before the event, HMX-1, commander of HMX-1, in an e-mail to the Deputy Commander of the Upper Marine Army Air Force, said "I just want to confirm that you know, because this event is highly important. "
The information indicates that the helicopter will be on approximately 7:00 p.m. to attend the activities at 3 p.m. and leave after 6 to 9 p.m. on that night.
The information also indicates that once the time has been delayed from the White House, the travel schedule is limited because of the need for group II staff.
The ex-computers were waiting on the helicopter during the activity, while security forces were waiting on the ground.
The journal "times" did not make it clear in the record whether the latter group members were needed.
"Hatche Act" prohibits the use of government property for political purposes by federal employees.
According to the record, HMX-1 had asked whether this activity was in violation of the Act.
The commander writes, "One of the questions we ask is whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and it was informed that there was no violation. "
"It sounds like you're locked up," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The White House has defined this "United States" activity as official activity, so it is not subject to the "Hatche Bill".
But even official activities have political colors.
In the event, the President raised the issue of the Senate at the time: medical reform and a strong breach of the control of government legislation.
The use of military army 1 or aircraft 1 for political advocacy is no new matter.
The former president was asked to ride these aircraft.
But it's not common to take it for a photograph.
In February, Tarnup was concerned at the slow slow pace of the presidential process in Melbourne, Florida, and finally stopped the background of his first election session, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of former Presidential experts.
Linsey Walters, a White House journalist, said that "the White House was no longer excited to see the 'United States' exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states, all of which were manufactured by American workers. "
The HMX-1 team regularly trained in flight training near Washington and the South Pole, where the President of the United States was placed in the White House.
During the first few months of the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 was held in the White House 58 times.
One official stated that this United States manufacturing activity was included in the training requirements for staff of this month group.
The helicopter forces also flew 11 hours that day for "non-Presidential support mission".
The White House claimed that tax collectors did not bear any other means of this activity.
Sikorsky said that the company did not participate in the exhibition of South-South helmsing helicopters.
HMX-1 does not retain the budget record of the President's flight, so it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of National Defence, according to the hourly cost of the financial year 2017, VH-3D costs may be reimbursed at $24,380 per hour of flight.
The military records recorded every 30 minutes of the aircraft flying from the base of the U.S. Army Air Force airport in Chechnya, Virginia.
The white hole claims that the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than the cost.
Walters says that "the cost of taxing is highly misleading based on the cost of payment.
These estimates include staff costs, maintenance costs and many others, including unencumbered costs in annual allocations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the costs of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence did not include staff costs, but did include oil costs, maintenance costs and contract costs.
At the time, the former White House journalist Sean Spike used the helicopter to defend this activity,
"The idea is to show the United States made this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Conching are proud of this, and they have all contributed to our country's security, and I guess there are thousands and hundreds of people working to rely on this.
And I think, like most Americans, we all feel proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of a number of Americans who do not give up.
So it's obvious that this isn't inconsistencies."
We don't know if Tranmp is interacting with the helicopter when he's on a tour of the South Pole in the event, but he's actually sitting on the train seat.
In the White House, Trannon spoke to Sikorsky, the representative of the company, and he was playing with the media with his own plane.
He said, "I know very well the Sikersky plane.
