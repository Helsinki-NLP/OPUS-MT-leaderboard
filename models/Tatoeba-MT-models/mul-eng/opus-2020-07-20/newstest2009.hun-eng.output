The pig's trash has been reduced to the end of trade
The damage to the pig's trash has been corrected after the morning hunger strike.
The transactions carried out by the Czech Energy Company (CHEZ) have been assessed close to the current day-to-day trade.
The pharaoh has been very active since the start of the second trade, when almost six percent of it happened.
Now there's a chance of the Wall Street shares after the fall.
We also welcome the market response to the result of the vote of the US Representative, which reiterated the support of the current financial sector's stabilisation plan.
Shares in Asia
In Asia’s wasteland, the dramatic rain of the shares was over, even though during the day, the indicators lost part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hong Seng trash index has written almost four percent during the course of trade, but later lost part of the losses and reduced the decrease by about 2.5 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong market was closed by 3.8 percent of Hong Kong Enterprises Index, which was responsible for China's shares.
The side effects of Sydney's trash have been reduced by more than five percent, but the losses have finally decreased to 4.3 percent.
According to the Taiwanese index, 3.6 percent of the population was.
"The timing of American rescue action has no proof and has an impact on the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, director of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, its monetary policy is independent of the Central Bank of China.
In Hong Kong, the bats are at the same level as the United States.
According to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should resume negotiations immediately and accept the financial system's support proposal.
In particular, it is a threat that other countries are experiencing the consequences of this.
U.S. shares in blood transfusions
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, to which $700 billion (at least 12 billion) would have to be converted.
The legislators therefore ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan will solve the main issues of the financial crisis and will help stabilize the whole economy.
In the morning, U.S. shares were transfused and the lead share indexes were registered for 20 years.
Almost seven percent of Dow Jones's life was the last one in 1987.
The index has already taken place before the vote, but when it became clear that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index began to be released.
Congress Regression: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The U.S. Prime Minister of Congress and President George W. Bush have taken the lead in the broader form of the agreement and in the financial assistance provided to the American financial system.
They're voting on this at the beginning of next week.
In negotiations on the approval of the pension scheme, the US legislators have found a breach in the form of a financial assistance amounting to $700 billion (about 12 billion) of the US financial system.
But I haven't won yet.
The Congress should consider certain aspects of the agreement before it can be publicized in the final form and votes of the law.
The financial system's support plan shall be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Thursday, he informed the Reuters Bureau of this information by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee of the Financial Services.
According to sequential sources, it is likely that a vote will take place on Wednesday at the latest on the plan.
According to the authorities, it should be reported that the pension plan is being approved, which is the first important factor in raising money markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, it is a "delegation" that follows.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have taken a great step.
We have clarified our different views on the form of a package to be used for market stabilization," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
He thinks the final vote can be held on Sunday.
The lawyers' representatives met with Henry Paulson on Saturday night with the U.S. Minister of Finance to give the government a final form.
This should be purchased from financial corporations for unusual assets that are subject to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are in favour of the final agreement on a plan that will work and which must be equally effective on the market.
The improvement plan needs to be continued, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Notice of Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on participating markets, which are extremely low.
According to German Democrat Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are therefore obliged to stop at Congress on Sundays.
They also want to ease investors before the start of the Asian monetary market trade, where the decision of Congress may primarily affect the trade of the week from the tax period.
At the same time, however, it is not clear whether the two friends of the United States Congress are voting on the law, or not, or whether the negotiations cannot be stopped due to any problem at the last moment.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still subject to many changes.
The total amount of aid for the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
The Congress may, however, block the issue of the remaining amount, which was determined in another $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it feels that the programme does not work.
Bush assessed progress in negotiations
Although the President may implement this decision, the Congress may, however, suspend its Members.
In spite of these changes, however, the programme remained the basis of which was the acquisition of material instruments for the purchase of securities that cost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to lose their trademarks.
"We've all grown up.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Sunday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The President of the United States was also satisfied with the transfer of the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said that the president was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and appreciated the "double efforts to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of bus performances
Christopher Dodd, Chairman of the Committee of the Bank of the Senate, said that the legislators had assumed responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of benefits, and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law limits the performance of the bus drivers involved in the programme and establishes a basic monitoring committee.
The foundation should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on this, and we've made great progress on a deal that will work and that will be useful to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan is also made available to households with the help of those who have problems with the loss.
The government should issue new disbursements from the indicators purchased by it, with a view to reducing the monthly deficits of the fees and allowing them to maintain their homes.
Marek: Help for the Family
The proposed plan, by David Marek, is a good idea for the management of Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"It's wrong, because you can't know what kind of mechanism and what price you're going to buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," says the iHNed.cz website Marek.
According to Marek, it's not so important that the plan is now left intact or at the beginning of the coming week.
"It is much more important that the Congressman be invited this week to support the plan and, as far as possible, give his award.
The importance of the spirit to bring up an agreement on the adoption of the plan, the most important thing at this time," Marek stressed.
Parharc on money: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll help you answer.
While almost every mobile device is able to upload MP3 files, no single MP3 player can be dialed.
It seems clear that it's better to buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there is a lot of reason that people would get a special MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which you use it and on your own needs.
You're probably having a hard time getting a high-quality haircut at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc.
Some of these musical products are not in the background, but there is no objective aspect of this quality.
However, if Polish is full of art rock, jazz, or blue buckles, it is likely to dream of such an explosive.
This is similar to the journey, i.e. multiplied - simplifying with MP3 music.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
Some may not be acceptable for a depositor to issue an eight thousand crowns like a Pink Floyd circuitr is likely to find it difficult to accept a meat crown market operator.
It's a two-way distance that everyone has enough space.
The choice is wide.
The survival of the elements also depends on
Some high-quality music is much more powerful than simple music, but even for which most mobiles are not even supposed to.
They're no longer as universal as the phone.
The primary features, in addition to phone and text messages, can also play music and video, both of which can be played, has a better camera, and you can even navigate.
And if we take into account the smartphones and the comms, it's gonna be a little computer in the pocket.
It's a little miracle, because there's no cold screen, and no single TV can take pictures.
More functional mobiles are also behind them.
The more you use your cell phone, the more often the display will be sent to the computer.
And music is one of the biggest power lines.
Small mobile devices are capable of playing music for more than ten hours, much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the most simple) are significantly more performance.
Count on empty cell phones, so you're not gonna play for a couple of hours.
If you're still on the phone here, you're going to get your place of work for the sake of security - it's also for the most expensive products.
The MP3 provider will not have such a problem, and even the worst will be performing a continuous operation for at least 9 hours with a backup.
The next problem arises when you upload music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only limited parts of the equipment are available with universal USB connectors and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be directly fixed to the memory card, but only a small card reader will turn around without adapter with a thumbnail card used in the mobile.
There are no special software for iPods other than iPods.
It's enough to download the equipment from the computer through USB.
Most of the mobile and viewers are already creating their own music library based on the manufacturer's name, the artist's name, or, for example, the user's rating.
Some of the products just paint a architecture similar to the Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating systems).
Dealers are easier to handle, mobiles know more
The choice of a particular device would be interested primarily in accumulator life, memory capacity, volume quality and type of volume, and of course the ease of treatment.
If the music serves you in the first place and you listen for only a short while, for example, on the villa, any MP3 mobile will be in your favor.
And that's actually any cell phone that's capable of.
You don't have to pay particular attention to what kind of music you know about your cell phone or display.
With MP3, each gets excited, and most of the music that comes out of your mouth will be in this format.
The MP3 is one of the most legislators and the decisive majority of the products are also featured in the WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) is less developed.
For example, on-line shopping makes it possible for better mobiles.
Just visit the appropriate pages of the server (or other servicer) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service can also be self-tested for the purchase of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of services is limited to the currency and usually limited to the same radio broadcasts.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally possible that the music will be managed in the future by such a mode of sale (whether via GSM, on the Internet or on the Internet without guidance).
Most people keep their cell phones on their own.
Whenever you're tempted to listen to something, your cell phone gets stuck in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 host is at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always keep the audiences or at least the audiences.
If not, you can use the built-in audio player, with almost every mobile, but only a small MP3 player.
For many, the greatest benefit of the music mobile will be the price.
In general, the most common side effects are less than three-fold corona.
You can get a pretty decent walkman between three and four crowns.
However, more than that, it limits you to the lack of a traditional audience.
The best and most equipped telephones can also be made in the back of up to 12 square miles [3,5 mm] of traditional ski lifts.
At the same time, it is not easy to treat patients.
In no way is it necessary to treat the most vulnerable (see our options) all of us.
A minimum function, a treatment that is similar to the previous normal injection of magnesium or gramophone.
There is no threat of interference in the form of unintended mobile internet, nor in relation to the following serial account for data transmission.
What Are Our Answers?
The most expensive mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually open to mobile memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
With the purchase of the appropriate card, it shall also be added to a maximum of two crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types only support 2GB maximum capacity cards.
Only the most expensive can start with at least 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have your mobile and even cheap MP3 provider, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irvert.
On the basis of capacity (max. 2 GB) no more than 1 100 kroner shall be charged.
If it belongs to the most important audiences, choose more special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungok).
These devices also have a special MP3 manual, which helps you get the MP3 adapter.
The most popular in the sector was Sony Ericsson, who has the same user interface as the special purchased MP3 player.
The above-mentioned MP3 brands can provide the same service in the same category up to four years, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, at least 35 hours).
The first virtual waiter has even come to Chechnya this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market has been substantially developed and our service providers offer services that are practically the same as the rest of Europe's partners.
Nevertheless, there is a lack of virtual service here for us - the basic price reduction of classical servants.
Maybe it won't be long.
The Mobil.cz website has been written many times that Czech servants are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the CTU, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in Chehora is more expensive than in other countries of the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission's regulation of roaming fees, this may lead to a controversial situation - some mobile phones from Czech companies will be cheaper than their homes.
How is it possible to compare Czech prices with Europe such high?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition you really want to fight.
This may sound counterproductive, because we have three mobile phones, and the penetrations are up to 100%.
In contrast, mobile servers complain sincerely that the Czech market is highly competitive.
Paul Dvorík, also president of the Czech Telecommunications Council, has several times stated that there is no new servant in Chechnya.
It may be true that a classic servant no longer has too many possibilities with his own network (but may still find it very difficult to find frequency).
However, there is another possibility - the virtual service provider.
At the same time, there was a significant decrease in the price of mobile servers, followed by the reaction of classic servers.
Even before the big fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile Great Britain, similar sounds were heard.
However, he has assured such ministers that they have their place and can indeed be successful.
But for example, we don't have to go too far.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of mobileking virtual service in Poland.
This service provider has not been able to acquire more than 100 thousand clients over a period of half a year and becomes the fifth largest service provider in the country.
Next to Mobilking is the Penta's financial group, which is owned by the U.
The advantage of virtual servers is the possibility of focusing on a much more complex target group.
For efficient operation, the same standard service requires a much smaller client.
It is not the same as the high cost of construction, mobility and maintenance.
Virtual servers in the world are generally low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, which are often opposed to less service.
For example, the United Kingdom Tesco Mobile offers at least five percent of its competitors a cheaper SMS.
But as the example of the Netherlands Mobileking shows, it can be a whole good move to a target group.
This service is the same special concentrate for men.
"The real men choose the mobileking service - which they like to trust," says David Seibert, director of this virtual entertainment company.
It's hard to say if we're going to get a picture like that of the Länder.
Miroslav Čepicý, Vodafone's dictionary, argues: "The Czech market is relatively small in its approach to the event, based on the majority of virtual servers.
In addition, it has been sufficiently satisfied with regard to the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, it is impossible to establish mobile servers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual service in Chechnya, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful development of this project, but the agreements in Czechoslovakia do not seem to be too hopeful.
In order to start the Mobilking, we are going to be in another country," said Jana Studničko, a spokesman for the Penta Financial Group at Mobil.cz.
In addition, he confirmed that existing Czech mobile servers are not overextended by this idea.
On the contrary, they are committed to making every effort to prevent any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has no longer hidden its interest in the introduction of a virtual service, which would therefore want to take a new step towards becoming a real competition partner for the company's Telephonica O2.
"We are very interested not only in guiding our customers but also in providing mobile telecommunications services.
More than ever, it's better.
This opportunity was again discussed with all the Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already been able to move forward in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group's speaker.
Maybe it's better time now.
Unofficial information seems to make us happy for the first virtual servant by the end of the year.
However, the birth of an undisclosed child is about to take place.
"At this point, we do not think that a fully-valued virtual service provider would be in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special against the other markets.
He has not always told us about us alone, a complex and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sršön, on the 02 media site of Mobil.cz.
The Czech market also refers to the special situation of other service providers.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile dictionary, adds with the exception of O2: "We have not yet identified a single-life and bilaterally successful business project which could be further based on it."
And he added, "In the T-Mobile network, it's not likely that by the end of the year, we'll open any virtual service.
At this point, there should be a specific agreement at the table so that you can think so briefly."
Vodafone pays more attention to the implementation of its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav Čepicý adds: "We are new to possible virtual services negotiations, primarily in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
In the eyes of the clients, we're just keeping this to the most cost-effective.
Vodafone's main strategy is partnership in this area to build fast mobile networks."
Responsible offices - a house with servants
The process of mobile service providers is easy to understand, a new entry of service would mean a rise in competition, a reduction in prices and a reduction in their benefits.
So why would we make it easy for such a competition to enter?
When service providers cooperate with one another, they also witness about the birth of the U.
The biggest pressure for ČTU is probably difficult to generate by the T-Mobile company's U phone.
This is a witness to the information publicly available on the CTU website.
But right now, U's going to be a good idea, so we don't let the virtual service come in.
Martina Kemrova added: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently weakened access to the fourth mobile market.
In view of the situation of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that a new player's entry into the market and service will meet high requirements."
However, given the full lack of interest of the Czech regulatory bodies in order to contribute to such an increase in mobile services, it is equally surprising.
It is not just about adding CTU, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to engage in economic competition.
That's all right with the Economic Competition Office.
However, the office is clearly referring to the whole problem.
"The step of the virtual service mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider has been concluded with respect to the provision of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, since the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not appropriate to traditional service providers," said Kristián Chlapua, a foreign class of the Economic Business Office.
No one would be surprised by such a statement made by the representatives of the service.
However, from the point of view of which consumers should represent their interests and also be subject to the fact that no one can return to their market situation, it is more than strange.
As an exception, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual servers usually work, we can note that our market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile services."
However, in the interests of the EU, pressure does not include the proper functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices.
In this case, many agree fully with the three mobile servers reaction.
The question is, if it's really just a misunderstanding, it's about itself.
However, in filling stations, completely identical petrol is certainly only the work of opinion and hard competition.
"The Office did not cover the signs of uncompetitive proceedings in this case, so there is no need to intervene in any way.
One provider has no leading position, i.e. no greater responsibility for market realities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual servers are probably also missing the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leader's position is one of the many points of discussion.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the ČTU, based on telecommunications from the single market in the face of economic competition.
After such a market, of course, there is no single Czech servant in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different view - approval of the network operator is always necessary for the virtual service provider to be established.
And the mobile server has a monopolium for its own network.
So, in a particular case, it's necessary to be dominant.
But even if we do not accept this opinion, it should be at least as important to the House that three mobile servers appear to go.
Interested parties' complaints (including the aforementioned GTS Nouva company) show that they are facing very similar obstacles in the ongoing negotiations with all service providers.
In addition, ČTú’s concern for ČTú is a very common trick in telecommunications, which the ÚohS will take over the whole matter.
That's what we've met in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the texts of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the extension of the law of the Czech Republic in the field of economic competition was not successful in telecommunications, although a number of experts hoped to improve the situation.
This must be well known by the representatives of the Lord, but it is likely that others are interested in it.
It works when no one pays attention
The operation of a number of virtual servers that are already operating in Czech mobile networks is not taken into account.
These are companies that issue their own mobile service prices, but are only partially published.
It's about companies dealing with the same multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The prices of these companies are usually limited to the chosen ones.
The insurance is based on the fact that the company acts as a classic company client against the service provider, which provides a large amount of SIM card.
You will receive special offers (and other benefits) after you become an exceptional customer.
The problem is that all mobile commercial conditions for Czech mobile phones leave the same precedent.
"If there were any cases to be dealt with, there could be a breach of contract terms, which we would deal with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrova answered our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that the information about the effectiveness of the work would have been available to the people responsible for the mobile service.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be a number of thousands of clients.
There is no protection against such a procedure by any service provider.
The activities of these companies have the same unsatisfied benefits and, unlike the actual virtual servants, they are not particularly threatened by their official markets.
Miroslav Čepicý warned about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, but the services of these companies only use a percentage that customers can afford.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot be fully available as regular mobile servers' clients."
But the CTU should at least make this strange.
In addition, another question is addressed to the LORD.
If mobile servers have lost their eyes to similar procedures, why are they blocking the birth of a virtual provider?
It must be added that the NUAHS has a strong right to take action and, if he does not wish, it should not be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not have any such capacity and that their commercial conditions would prevent them from doing so.
When we're not gonna be the favorites
As mentioned several times in the text, access to virtual servers has led to a significant decrease in the price of services.
In particular, in all countries where virtual servers have been created, classical servants have tried to prevent their creation from being created more or less.
The concepts used by them were practically identical - too small, possibly too much a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developed countries, the regulatory bodies were introduced at these moments, which did not in any way protect the interests of mobile servers but their clients.
It was then either formal measures or information pressure that created the first virtual service followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are giving the whole case to each other.
On the basis of our standards, we cannot free ourselves from the pressure to have unreasonable competences in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service is really soon displayed, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If any service provider would allow any virtual mobile service provider to be established, the UOHS may only be able to remain together in order to prevent further interested parties (to discrimination).
And in other parts of Europe, we may not be able to call anymore.
The new church has four new versions of heaven.
Choose the best
Listen to four processings of the new version of the Czech State.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolán held a celebration on the day of the Czech State. Where is my home?
The sky has been set up by the National Film Festival to lead Jiří Bélohláve.
Four versions are available - with male or female speakers, with songs or instruments.
Caterina Kings and Adam Plachetka's song.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the divine modification.
The iHNed.cz website can listen to all four versions.
Czeh national dance is one of the most beautiful gods of all time.
Cseh Radion has already said that he has chosen a very young representative music that is expressive and popular.
"Although from the beginning both of them, and later in the music, I tried to apply to the pure dictionary, to the meaning of the text and to the agreement," he said.
The Czech state heaven will celebrate the 175th anniversary of the future.
Where is my home? Title song first held in the Rendi Film House in 1834 in the band called Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, finished with the music of the Francisc Šcroup.
It became normal, and people looked at us spontaneously.
And the first verse of the verse became a natural part of the state's divine nature after the Revolution of 1918.
After the invasion of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
What's the "new" heaven?
For the first time, the rail transport company is also sent with a chip card
On 1 October 2008, it shall enter into the history of the Central Transport Office as the first route to the metro, villas and buses, which will be the electronic purchase of paper in the pocket.
The coupon can now be purchased by about a hundred people who have an OpenCard chip card.
Travelers can buy 30 days and 90 days and an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and can also travel to their bikes at the Central African Republic Information Centres and at the Museum, Museums, Museums, Nádraží Holešovice, Andël, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrad, Kacherov and Luka metro services.
The coupons are also available on the Internet from yesterday through the Transport Office website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by several customers in the 4th century.
Those who start using the Internet trade can eventually forget the cost-effectiveness of the metro buildings, where they have to carry out regular long lines for the lines.
The coupon can be purchased in the same way over the Internet and also stored on the Opencard card in one of the sixteen books of the Watch Tower Society.
"In these places there is a bottle of services available to passengers who help interested parties to buy online and buy their tickets," said Martin Opatrní, project spokesman.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons will be able to go to Opencardra in some pre-service cars.
How do these cars look?
Pirosk, the reporters were reminded and the passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budéjoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"There are now five of them in the city, but they should be eight by the end of the year," Opatrní added.
Check the cap automatically instead of the driver
It's easy to handle automatics starting tomorrow.
It's enough to place the Opencard chip card and a previously paid purchase will leave you alone.
Electronics are not only in the capital but also in the neighborhood.
Thus, between 300 and 499 buses and bus stations around the city, the main destinations of the Mediterranean region are to travel to the capital.
"In the context of integrated rail transport, fish have been seen with cardboard readers, who, with the help of the buyers, have also established the validity of the trains," explained the control of the lines from the Ropid organisation of the railway network in Filip Drapal.
In the buses around the city, the card readers are on the driver's side of the bank.
The driver must therefore show not only the chip card when ingest, but also the Opencard must be placed at the location specified on the cash page.
This is how the driver monitors the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it is easier to ask the driver for this," Drapal added.
Travelers who travel by bus outside the city and don't even remember the validity of our purchases will be able to go back to the autosellers on the cards.
The information on the validity of the documents is displayed here on the label of the device.
The prisoners wanted a vote from the United States.
The Germans were asked to join the United States in 1945.
This is from the letter contained in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Korea.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is likely that this was the wish of some Germans who were sent to the US President in 1945.
This is also evident from a letter left out of my own book, which is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Korea today.
The Germans of Česky Krumlov in the letter ask the US President not to allow the return of the "Shuumava goe" to Czech Republic, which Hitler has still taken under the Munich Treaty.
"The situation is well understood and we really want to be certain of the words that the American teams in the German territories say that they come not as persecutors or as enemies but as freemen," says the letter, "People whose hearts are singing the Shuumava race" under the signature.
Since the association with the Czech Republic is likely to give hope to the Germans of exile - in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - only to brutality, intolerance, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the author's authors ask the American president to take over the protection "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of the four million inhabitants, this area would be judged by a foreign country, which I condemn and defend the minority, and at least nothing would contribute to the victory of the allies," says the letter.
The fact that the authors couldn't write down is that I'm afraid of the "csech printing" fraud.
So if the president of the United States were to doubt in the opinion of the Sumavian Germans, it would be enough for you to hold a referendum on whether they want to become part of the USA and whether they want to live under the United States' patrol.
While the text of the letter may seem a bit vague with the current knowledge of postwar history, it is appropriate to describe the expectations of the imprisoned Germans.
Even if the Czech Germans had to be at least able to learn about their departure from the country, only a few of them were aware of the possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to stand in the same kind of autonomy for their prisoners.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, a journalist born in the Czech Republic.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German budéjovicei during the war.
At the end of the war, when the British were arrested and taken to the Dutch concentration camp, thousands of other Czech Germans joined in teaching them to do so.
"They believed that when they go home, the Czech language would be good for them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war were considered to have been expelled from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think you're paying!
The sensitive campaign attacks leaders
In the case of Chechnya, the most expensive action for road safety.
This would be the case with the media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Saturday.
However, the Prime Minister of Russia hopes from this campaign that he will abandon the leaders from a dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be on television, on the radio, on the music, on the Internet, and on dictionary pages.
The leaders should be removed from the fast movement and from alcohol.
And you should remind them that they're going to put safety belts in before they fall.
First of all, young drivers, motorists, professionals and not the last ones to get to know the trainers.
And what does it mean in the ads?
Feelings are offensive, primarily human history.
This is also the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you're paying!
The word "do not think" is written with great letters on the system.
And in his blood, he's called "paying."
This must mean that a person can pay for a temporary neglect of life.
The viewers are "lost" until 2010.
The ministry was developed by campaigns similar to those in English, where victims of accidents can be seen on a regular basis.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The ads were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Get up, get the horses.
"The driver's "take me, get me" order is valid.
'Stop 'to numbers when they're going through the piroson, so they're saving time.
'Take 'em' is a risk of punishment or accident.
The driver needs to remember the risk," says Martin Kořán, a psychologist at the Na Homelce Hospital.
And that's why you need the information campaign in the media, primarily the negative campaign, thinks the psychologist.
He considers the driver’s attention to be less effective than the risk tables.
"If there is a risk warning table, it is likely that soon the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," Koryan warned.
He'd almost return all the frozen land to peace.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke about the return of virtually all areas, namely the rest of Jordan, the East Jerusalem and the Golan Islands, to peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
That's what he said in an interview that was published by Jedio Akhron on Sunday.
"We have to deal with the Palestinians, which means that almost all of us must return the whole (resurrected) area," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We have a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians have to give a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He recognized that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and primarily wants tractors and bulldozers not to go over the foot, as one of my best friends had to give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, following the attack on two July cities where some people were killed and some thousands were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple Mount, Holy and Historical Places" in the city.
"Those who want to protect Israel's sovereignty across the whole city must integrate 270,000 trees.
It won't work," he stressed.
Exemption from Golan fensicles
He also expressed an opinion on the Israelites' expulsion from the Golans, which makes it impossible for them to enter into a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose peace with Syria only on the basis of the exit from Golan," he warned.
"The hearts are well aware of what they have to say in order to get Golan.
They must provide current relations with Iran; they must provide links to Hezbollah (Site Movement); they must provide regular support for the terrorism of Hamasz (Site Movement), Al-Qaida and Dzshad (holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister pointed out.
After a accident, are passengers allowed to stay in the buses?
The law doesn't know them, you don't have to drive in a remote bus
In connection with the tragic bus bus accident of the Student Agency, the question was raised near the Italian Padova, whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus.
"If we want to keep the law strictly and formally, the road searcher's activities are contrary to the traffic law," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
In the past week, the death of a hundred-year-old passenger was probably caused by a truck driver.
The poor girl sat next to the driver at the moment, at least in the safest place, although she had two more places for her.
The bus can be slowed down, or it can be slowed down at the same time as you serve the passenger coffee or offer news.
It has a role to play in whether the bus is available according to the marketing authorisation.
If there is no approval in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The Student Agency's remote buses do not have their seats, which is confirmed by Radim Jançura, the director of the company.
"We tried to find a solution with this ministry, and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this was rejected, and we came to the point that passengers could go to the hall on the road when they had their own meetings," he said.
The law doesn't know the passenger.
"There is no clear rule of law on the role of travel - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services.
The road traffic law knows only the vehicle manufacturer's law; it does not define his rights and obligations," makes it less clear to Hanzelka's dictionary.
Josef Pokorní, Director of the Department of Road Traffic Operations, is against the view that the law is dealing with the problem.
"It depends on whether the bus is involved in the business permit.
And it's over," she says.
According to their differences, the buses may be cities where they are located and limited to maximum speeds and to higher speeds between the cities and allowed to stay and to stay at the maximum speeds provided by the safety zones.
Like in the plane, the expert says
Jaroslav Horín, the BESSIP transport safety expert in the movement of passengers does not see a basic problem at the bus stop.
"In the course of the continuous movement, there is no risk, we can compare the situation to the service at the airport.
It's not safe here when there's turbulence and the air traffic controller can get his head in."
"If, however, the bus would soon wake up, of course, the physical laws.
Just like the city bus or the villas.
Travellers need to deal with the safety of passengers with internal rules," he says, and at the same time he feels that the problem has not been solved by law.
Jançura is ready to destroy services
The Student Agency provides travel services as a single bus driver.
Two hundred passengers were employed.
After the accident, the manager does not keep his employment at risk.
"But as soon as I'm under pressure, the occupation of passengers is dangerous, and I'm down.
The coffee and the news are available when passengers arrive.
It would also be cost recovery," he says.
The lack of passengers was due to security concerns in commercial vehicles, Alexei Litvin, the head of Asia, who operates two courses in comparison with the Student Agency.
"We don't have any passengers, we'll face this from the beginning.
Before or after, it ends with some deadly injury," he said almost a year ago to Tyden.cz.
An Unexpected Tragedy Happened
The company's two-year-old plsenian passenger died during a daily cycle.
The Slovenian truck probably broke out of the station without using the driver's license and stopped the bus.
The bus driver's shoes were tied up with a manoeuvre, but the bus's better-fashioned part of it.
The fact that two permanent places were sold for the rest of the passengers would also be sold back to Jancura.
"These places can't be held on their remote tracks, they're blocked."
The company wants to follow the driver of the truck.
The Agency does not wait for the court to punish the family of the girl, but it also expects financial damage from the criminal.
- Rehabilitation?
In the future of the distance
The accuracy of the movement of passengers could be reflected in the bus coverage of the legislative amendment, which takes more than one year from the third-party expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"The group, however, did not achieve any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the focus system is on the vehicle at maximum speed allowed and on mobile use in driving," says expert Horijn.
"The Ministry of Transport does not maintain the activities of passengers, which would pose a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, saying that monitoring the safety of buses is within the control of the police and the employment offices.
The hope of the Desseldorf in Frankfurt
Written to the employees of the Bank's government of WestLB is not quoted in large words.
The units of the Desseldorf and the Frankfort Deka-Bank can create "the central capital market organization of the Financial Central Bank" - write a letter published on Monday.
WestLB will enter a permanent "competitive block" in such a business.
Such a relationship could give rise to further mergers in the relevant banking sector.
This is the reading when a government wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the unconfirmed WestLB bank continues to suffer a great deal of pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Board, who was recently informed by the North-Westphalia government that the deadline for finding a permanent solution would come.
However, there is already a good time to talk about the same kind of relationship - part of Frankfurt between Deka-Bank and WestLB.
Franz Waas, director of the Deka-Bank at the end of August, knew when he was informed that the bank in Mainzer Landstraße and a bank in stock, such as Helaba or WestLB merger, had no meaning.
Despite this, the Director of Deka, one of the banks in charge and the other of the representatives of the cash banks, entrusted the administration with continuing negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In this case, the capital market or certain parts of it can be spoken.
However, the negotiations - they set up financial circles - have just begun.
The name Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, does not first appear in relation to the consolidation of the cash sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deka-Bank was alone with the Landesbank Rhineland-Pfalzcal and the Helababa.
However, nothing has yet been made of this third alliance.
The plans were almost publicized, and the coastal government opposed the interest of Helaba.
After that, the other two banks didn't find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to Baden-Württemberg instead of the State Bank.
However, the idea of the Deka-Bank and the reserve banks has been re-examined.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Government, spoke against the plan of mergers with his bank.
This is independent of the recognition that it is necessary to approach the various banks of the central sector.
Now, after the country's national collection elections, the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected first.
This isn't necessarily good news for Heba.
If pressure on further mergers is increasing, possible partners can be stopped as soon as possible.
In South Germany, it could only be a small business, but both the financial crisis has been significantly better purchased than the Munich and the Tutgar banks.
The merger between WestLB and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, 85% of the business in Helababa, was terminated at the beginning of the year.
You'd better stay in NordLB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of my mind.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how different business models of individual banks are to you.
In June, Merl announced that the German Takar money and the Association had not yet responded to the decisive question of the business model to ensure the future of the banks in question.
Finally, it is possible to introduce WestLB, which they do not want to know about.
Thus, by letter from the Italian government, it is part of a "complete solution" in all cases.
That this is how it is compatible with the association of the individual units with the Deka-Ban, it's still the next song.
The second weekend of October is known as "loose weekend"
For the first time, Luca's the third or fourth time.
Now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything else, says Luca.
After them, the Kaiser brand has a strong body with a strong body of expertise, and it proves to some 200 people who travel the Oktoberfestre how deep they can stand in front of the tower.
First, she'll kiss Luca's face and then kiss her.
They came from Bologne to Verona.
From here, the Porta Nuova beach next to the bus park four buses started at 23.45 a.m. "Destinazione Monaco, festival della burra" road goal, arriving at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses, mostly carried by the Italians, travel only in the fourth brazilian.
In one of the parking lots, the South Americans were already sitting next to their shopkeepers, and the meeting was started in the evening.
And it's so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who has a long, mechanical, and wide, cold-sighted view.
He spent five years traveling to October, only three trips this year.
It's there tonight at 8:30 p.m. in October.
The hotel would only mean a relatively low cost, Marco says.
The road is reached in Euro 75, which includes a welcome tour of Kaiser, which has been brought up under the law of the Bajor's sordidity law, as well as the disaster insurance and the German-language navigation - Marco Frankfurt has carried out a German language course.
And they're already taking you to the bus at night to Brenner.
It's okay, it's still gone.
The bus will be down soon, the passengers will be asleep.
That's all right, they'll need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are a number of Italian buses in the 8th highway and a short drive ahead of Munich.
When Marco's group arrive at the park near Theresienwiese in half a week, there are about 50 other buses coming from Europe.
Elena, Luca, and the others are going to meet, Marco has another last informant, informs the head plan.
First of all, everyone pick up the yellow hat.
On this page you can read the phrase "Oktoberfest" on the left, along with the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggindo.it".
Next time, "When the sirens open, run," Marco gets in the morning.
"Fout!" is the recording of places on the back of the flight and the back of the hall.
"Not in front of us, because we're going out and don't sit on the floor like that, but let's put it in the chair."
The single course is reached in Euro 8.25. Marco's hour.
And don't stop the drill.
"Show the security guards how to behave well.
When you leave the places, they'll take them."
Third time, "I'll be back here at midnight at about ten o'clock!" Do you understand?
And he's headed to Wiesn.
While on the road, one man binds silk hats as a guide to the trees, the tables, the fact that one of the great bajor people is also a choice plate.
You've got to get ready for the reconnaissance.
This is the second weekend of October, known as "the last weekend".
There are no accurate figures; there are about 50,000 people who pass through the Alps in the resorts, which is estimated to be ten percent of all visitors last week from Italy.
The Munich Police will strengthen the seven South-Third Police forces to assist the Bador Red Cross, which, in its national statistics, includes about 200 medical supplies, the Italians take the first place, in front of the districts (kb. 80) and the British for the low-cost increase (kb. 60).
In the Italians, he was particularly fond of the Hofbrüller.
Unbelieving Nights for the Hippo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system was relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "studentally" and, in his statement, also believed that the German banking sector did not demand critical developments.
Because this is the end of the week.
Daxon, a company owned by Möncheni Hippo Real Estate (HRE), received billions of loans from the German banks to protect themselves against market turbulence.
One person who knew the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan payments amount to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should only be paid after the required part of the claim.
The money comes from private and private banks.
In the background, there are losses of the Depfa girl.
Depfa, which concludes state funding assurances, is a long-term loan for long-term projects, and has refinanced itself for these very short-term loans - which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash balance decreased by EUR 95% to EUR 2.37 million, and its own capital also decreased by 1.6% to 1.45 percent.
Net income from current incomes and cash flows from previous year's same year will be zeroed from the appropriations for the claims and determined securities and revenue from the calculation of the credit assets will be returned to EUR 5 million with a 70 percent reduction.
Only the higher revenues resulting from the final cost of the conversion of the former Depfa group, as well as the loss of revenue under the concession, and the relatively low revenue of 16%, were attributable to businesses.
Following the privatisation in 1990, the former State financer was exposed to the company's assets which were later transferred to the Aeral Bank.
As the classical state funding could be reduced, the Defa was increasingly involved in infrastructure projects as well as private investors and public-private partnerships (PPP) and internationally expanded its activities.
In the case of female companies, the Hippo Real Estate should now perform descriptions that are generally used to show the group's results.
The fact is, the payment of the department didn't happen.
The division has already been reduced to the third in 2007.
Since the transfer of the Hippo Real State to Defa, it has become a significant public and infrastructure fundant.
Other financial institutions are more dependent on the refinancing of the central banking market because they do not have clients.
The Bank of the United States Lehman Brothers' investment bank concluded two weeks earlier that the banks had settled between each other because the banks were maintaining their liquidity.
In order to refinance a part of the Depfa credit portfolio of Hippo Real Estate, some EUR 50 billion is needed for short-term refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the group's funding requirement is covered by the time the credit is available, and the company has protected the company "from the impact of the currently highly operational international financial markets."
According to other sources, the refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the HR administration, stated in this regard that the financial markets should not be taken into account until the Hypo Real Estate group is available.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Service Authority (BaFin) see that the Hypo Real Estate group is already equipped with market capacity.
This gives hope to bank participants and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and indisputableness of the crisis, certain things cannot be done.
It is not even possible to imagine that funding should not be fully required.
But this opposition can't be stopped.
After the late Saturday evening news told me that the bank was still on the side of your chair, it was still not able to ease the tastes.
The share volume is reduced by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
In this respect, they are able to keep themselves in line with the bonds.
While the tax rates are slightly changed in the first place, the subsequent regulated bonds are significantly reimbursed.
In particular, the crisis affects the past generation, the bonds of Württemberg Hypo and, in a way, the excessive running hours in 2009.
As long as the Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously viewed as a speculative investment alternative, the valuations should now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system and to the point that the bank's presence and the financial institution took the crisis home with the transfer of Depfa.
As long as the records, governments and less-hazardous business banks are still ready to support the system, it can be triggered by the loss of revenue for the duration of the journey.
Or it will come about that no one can hope to survive the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports relating to the partial stateisation, the short-term likelihood of specificity has now been distorted by a legitimate hope.
Long-term creditors can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to choose from their investment.
Short-term investors may, however, use the sale in order to cover the taxes paid after the next few years' price savings.
Sylvana and the Bento box secrets
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up at the Tachibana High School on his first day of education, girls start to cry: The German girl has a "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the monks - you're talking about Japan in the new CSE blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was really nervous.
I was on my way to school on vacation.
I live on Tokyo, on the Kavasaki side, and travel 40 minutes to Tachiban High School.
I had to find the way alone, I didn't regret it.
It seems that the start of education in Tachibana is not taking place as seriously as home in Alsó-Sauszor.
The students start in eight hours until 8 a.m., 40 hours a short conversation with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the education started, I had the chance to show it.
And I'm not the kind of guy who's willing to talk to people in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet had my school uniform, my roommate had an old habit of wearing blue, blue hair and black leather.
So in this dress I stood in front of the cathedral and tried to make it all right: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - called Sylvana, I came from Germany, and it's going to be my birthday in a week.
At this point, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language for two years.
All 31 girls were baffled, angry and confused, and I heard the word "fucking" all the time.
I've known this from my grandmother.
This is about the Japanese girls' basics, and that means "cuki, sweet."
Then I went to my place quickly.
The girl who sat next to me was deeply moved, and she felt honored that they had sat next to her.
The back part of the hour was quiet enough, but when he spoke the cold, they usually broke up.
Everyone spoke and commended him, and his questions puzzled him, and it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then everyone packed his pen.
I've also had such a meal - it's completely different than the ten-hour sandwiches of the unaltered Germans.
I've got a hairy rice, a little cloves, salads and oil, fruit juice and a kind of brown meat.
Most of the time, I don't know what to eat here in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they have a completely new taste.
I mean, it's all very nice.
Well, yes, maybe with the salt-induced exception, brrrrrr!
In Japanese schools, the bento is not just food.
Suppose a girl gives a boy her own hand-made bento, which is especially artificially composed in hopes that she can get to know him more closely in the lunch season.
That's what I read in my mother's pictures.
I'm curious if I can watch this here too.
"Why, indeed, Japan?" - My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
"Because you're just getting dressed."
I've been reading mangoes for years.
And that I understood the pictures and the culture described them better, and I started learning Japanese once.
It was quite obvious to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're in big trouble here.
Japan is one of the latest techniques and trends - and another is strict, armed and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I've never felt lost to myself, even if Tokyo was the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
The rats have feelings, too.
You're going to go for a pack or a lot of trouble, does that mean you're scared?
Joseph LeDoux is a neurological scientist who is convinced that animals also have feelings.
But how can you examine whether they feel the same way they treat us?
In the "Edge" online journals, prominent scientists have published the articles for years.
Spiegel Online is one of the series "What's the truth without proving it?" from the answers he received.
I believe that animals have feelings and other knowledge, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, and it's true that we can't even prove that we know other people.
In this case, at least we can hope that all human brain configurations are identical.
However, as we examine other types, and in the sense of feeling or generality, we ignore the questions of knowledge, which are difficult to reach because the hardware is not compatible.
When a pack is threatened, he does the same as many other animals: he's killed himself, he's gone, or he's attacked.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in similar subjective experiences from some researchers.
But I don't think so.
The structure of the brain makes it difficult for us to pass our own subjective experiences on to animals.
The human knowledge-related price circles are almost always included in the page's pre-frontal question (because of the role of the short-term memory and implementation/direction functions).
This vast area has been developed higher in human case than in other major groups, and it seems that other species are completely lacking.
At least we know about the aspects that depend on the pre-frontal grid, for example who we are, or where planning and decision-making skills are appropriate, that man is different from other key individuals.
Another dramatic characteristic of the human tongue is: Since human experience is an important part of language, it is often said that knowledge depends on it.
In this case, animals can be eaten.
However, even if it does not depend on language knowledge, the language will certainly affect the animal knowledge, no matter what its nature may be, it is likely to differ greatly from most of our knowledge.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what information may be available for other animals.
If knowledge is not measured as internal and subjective things, and because of our special hardware, it cannot be measured on the basis of our own experience, then our research will be of serious concern to us.
Most of my findings relate to the content of knowledge, but there is also another aspect of knowledge that is likely to be closer to science.
Animals could be tested without regard to the content of the scientific processes, and that is precisely what happens in the short-term memories of major humans, especially in the case of visualization.
However, under the conditions examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they are more likely to support foreign relations than for criminal mechanisms: Both can be identical, neither can they be.
Interestingly, this statement also highlights the importance of the pre-frontal silence in the creation of the visualisation.
What is the result of this feeling?
This leads me back to activating an emotional system, such as fear, in a brain that is pure of its own activities.
So what we call "my body" is the mental state in which we are when we take into account the functioning of the localised protective system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions).
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the areas of the brain that are characteristic of humans and especially humans.
The sign of the language is made up of fine improvements because with the help of words and language, we are able to distinguish and categorize them as well as to describe them to others.
In this respect, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings are derived from the simpler activities of the brain and the body’s physiology areas, such as Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can play an easy role in the broad sense of variety.
I don't think I can handle this, but I'm not convinced.
Pankzeep thinks that what seems to be a fear of rats and people is probably the same in both cases: How can you check if the rats and people feel the same when they behave the same way?
You're going to go to a safe place, do you think he's afraid?
In my view, the same behavior has not yet been proved by the same experience.
While neural association continues to help: our brains are like rats and people, we don't even have ears.
But the agent is responsible for the feelings?
And even if this could be true of people, how can we prove this to be true in the case of the packs?
I think the packs and other people, but maybe even the clowns (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove this.
And since their feelings are basically different from theirs (because human knowledge is a special commodity and language) rather than the emotional behavior of the packs than their emotional feelings.
In any case, the flow rate in these areas is at the neutral level, if we measure the same in the packages and in the people.
Like I don't know the language and the knowledge of the packages, I don't know if they exist.
Others may seem to be a short-term addition, but they are more likely to die than they are to be constantly suffocated.
Because I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of the UEFA: Long term for Poland and Ukraine
Mr Ivan Vasjunik, Vice-President of the Office, announced that the preparations will be soon under direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government, in its decision of UEFA Bordeaux, sees the confidence and testimony of Ukraine that they believe that Ukraine is able to organise the European Union together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there are still many people in both countries."
The construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports is in the remaining two visiting countries.
It is possible that the number of EC stadiums will be reduced by eight.
"We can't waste more time.
We need to work very fast now," said Grigory Szurkis, President of the Association of the Red Cross in Ukraine.
"UEFA will continue to hold us."
In Poland, they were even more radical.
Following a number of bottlenecks, the National Olympic Commission suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN, which was sure to be replaced by the independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission took the initiative of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
In addition to the "complex risk that PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," Drzewicki announced to the Polish PAP News Agency.
"In writing, we have assured the President of UEFA that this will not adversely affect the EU's 2012 preparations."
In the past year, only a number of first league teams had to be manipulated into the lower class and finally the link starter had to be fished.
The newly created Dennis Quaid
The dancer would like to advertise a new film, talk about her own experience, and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband.
One who steals - and returns
The Russian war of Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-wife: The two Hollywood dancers fought each other for seven years after the election - before the public.
And Ryan, in an interview with American InStyle, announced earlier last week about the answers: "Dennis was very rude to me, which caused many pain."
And only after the election did you know how many women Dennis had sex with.
The mental stripper Ryan's new video on the film "The Women" was filmed, which illustrates the history of a marriage breakup.
Dennis Quaid, who was resolutely responding to an angry husband, declared: "Servish" - the 54-year-old dancer to the New York Daily News newspaper - "that We will re-examine and reverse our relationship history."
In addition, it's "supply" that 16-year-old sons, Jack again "reminiscently of the many pain and change that makes the answer a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the answer, Quaid has grown up again, and recently became a stepfather.
That's why the next page ends with the answer: "My life goes on everywhere.
I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in order."
Prices for airport tickets and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008 European airports and hotels were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one current study, in Germany, aircraft were less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of airports and hotels were even more favourable - so can the result of one of the American Express travel and financial service studies.
The company analysed the data on the first half of 2008 and established a significant valuation in the second quarter following the first quarter of the price.
As the prices increased over the years in the hotel market, the hotels became much cheaper.
Between January and March, prices increased by an average of 6.9% in 48 European cities surveyed by the year 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, there were 3.6 percent lower prices than in the previous year.
This trend was shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
This is what the American Express sees in the low price of the dollar, which led to "the American tourist's pleasure of walking".
Reduced hotel rooms are better affected by financial centres such as Frankfurt or London, such as industrial cities, e.g. Hannover, Kolnt or Stavanger.
In Norway, 26.3 percent of the hotel prices are European records.
In the first quarter, there was also a growing change in guidelines for airport prices.
As a result of the decline in kerosin, tourists had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-term flights required for large-scale fuel have cost 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist class tickets decreased by an average of 12.5 percent from the previous quarter, however, business and the first class showed only a more moderate change in prices.
In Germany prices were even higher than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the prices of domestic flights in Germany decreased.
The decline in prices is partly due to the growing economic growth of the company.
The search for the airport market has been slow in many respects.
On the other hand, after the Open Skies Agreement on the liberalisation of air travel between the USA and Europe, the pressure exerted by the competition is strengthened.
The situation is confirmed by the loss of the aircraft, and in the first half of 2008, the number of aircraft reported has been reduced to 24 aircraft in Europe alone.
HSV 1:0 to Gladbachot
The Hamburger SV lived on the table in a round and simple way.
Luhukaya in Borusia is not yet able to complete the working group.
Christopher Klein's Biggest Deep Island for the nationally elected Marko Marin.
The gladbachi player is only late in the game, and he's getting back from his hat.
He's got a message that he's clearly accepted. He left his mouth open.
She just knew she was right.
"We need the second floor," said Hermann Rieger during his journey to the hamburger arena cabin.
Not much has happened in my catacombs, due to the end of the drought, and most of them have stayed in their place.
Rieger was about three years old at HSV's physical therapy, attracted to a larger view than some hairy players.
That's what he asked for. He found a hearing at his place.
Cornelius Jol, a helper, was injured, and he showed up on his cell phone.
Cornelius is the leader of the hamburger, Martin Jol's son.
His command could have been similar to saying, "Here's the second floor."
The execution of the order is still in progress.
"Today wasn't always a good sight," she later met Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt also "showed it" the thing.
The success of the hamburgers is due to the head of the Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that the very weak gladbachies could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a great victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this week.
The viewers had already celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the arena poured oil and the table on the exit, which described the crowds as class leaders.
It'll be a birthday without a party.
"We know where we're going," said Marcell Jansen.
It is estimated that the evidence between the table is more quantifiable than that of the HSV dominance.
Although the team will soon find its contracts - for the Brazilians, Neves and Silva, for Petrics, and for Jansen from the FC Bayer, you will soon find yourself, but you will not be brilliant.
"We need more feelings and action," demanded Joel.

Concentration affects the flight of steroids
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing inconsistencies among researchers for years. The dark matter affects the speed of the vertebrate during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts believe that Albert Einstein can't have a full level of relativity.
The Ulysses' army was flying around 18 years in the world.
The fast-paced fuel lines threaten the cold.
Scientists have been working on a secret phenomenon for years, the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means gravitational pressure levels of the gravitational zones, during which additional radiation is added to the earth, such as in the gravitational area of the Earth.
Thus, the probes can produce a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research team used this physical pressure to the same extent as Ulysses' Sun.
What has been done for years, however, for researchers: Aircraft objects do not behave fully as expected under the law of ancient gravity.
Instead, irregularities occur at speeds.
The bodies are unexpectedly up or down.
The physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was passed through the anomaly of Swing-by.
Some experts believe that Albert Einstein may not even have a general relativity concept, which puts the mass of the substance in place as a barrier to the area.
Stephen Adler's American physical worker, Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continued to believe that Einstein was not wrong, and the Swing-by anomaly is trying to explain with the so-called dark material, which the surgeons were hiding in the universe.
"The dark substance may be responsible for the anomaly, which may be found even around the Earth," says Adler.
From the existence of the dark matter, the lighthousers have only been informed for ten years.
Clearly, there is a gravitational force that can monitor the effect of other compounds.
However, the substance itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially does not release or return any visible light.
According to scientists, the total amount of space in the universe is well combined with the dark matter.
Exempted Travellers in Egypt

In a similar vein, Egyptian state television, Al-Arab Arab TV and Italian media were included.
According to Italian Sky TG 24 television newsman Franco Frattini, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed the fact of free forgiveness: "Our officers and the other prosecutors were released.
Let's now examine health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Roman citizen, as well as eight Egyptian explorers, were familiar with Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the Soviet expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
It continues to be a cause for shooting before the prisoners are released: According to an Egyptian security officer, the prosecutors have already shown a willingness to forgive the prisoners when the Sudanese army has miraculously killed dogs.

"It led to suicide" by the modern-day forces.
The court ruled that a woman had committed suicide because she had been raped for years.
Cornwall, who lives in the City of Stithians, was 57 years old when Michael Trerise was in prison for 6 years after he witnessed an eight-year-old rape attempt.
The court found out that she had regularly bound her daughter, Stephanie Randle, between the age of five and a week.
Trerise wrote in a statement, "I feel sorry for the death."
The negotiations concluded that Randle was suicide on 1 April 2007 in the fourth home of the city of Mulley, Plymouth, 34 years old.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise forced her face and put her face in front of the meetings while her mother worked in a refrigerator.
Trerise became his wife in the 1980s and re-elected Cornwall.
He's now moving to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was revealed that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time on the National Trust's charity organization, was sent to the camps twice a week by two returning forces.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who had previously been in love with pain and grief, said her friends, "feeling dead" and "lost about life".
In April 2007, her mother, Terrence Randle, died in the apartment of Plymouth.
He probably got caught up in a bag.
Mr. Randle's daughter's father, who wrote her testimony in a letter, said, "I've always bound and closed her eyes.
I didn't have sex.
I feel responsible for death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're a strange fetisher, and you're sure that this sacrifice was disgusting to him, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unfortunate family member ended up killing the victim.
However, the fact is, if you don't, the case may never have been brought before the court."
The judge added: "I call attention to what effect Stephanie's parents have had on the girls of the crimes committed by you over the years.
If that hadn't happened, she would probably have become a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Important information was placed under the charge of a prosecutor
According to the BBC's assessment, they accuse the government office of having clearly forgotten confidential documents in a mission in June.
The man was sent by the Ministry of Defence when he left two carefully hidden documents in a container of Waterlobo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This is a more legitimate charge of the violation of the law, and there is no doubt about the causal procedure.
Frank Gardner, a scientist assigned to the BBC Ministry of Defence, has taken a lot of action in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would handle the case as internal affairs," he said.
An application which cannot be named was filed under the law under point 8.1. This paragraph refers to the protection of information.
The State Prosecutor recommended that the charges against officials be represented by the Metropolitan Police on behalf of the male in relation to the United Committee of Commerce, which may be sensitive to the nature of his work.
The documents lost by it included confidential investigations concerning Al-Qaida and the skills of the Iraqi army.
They were notified of the decision on Monday, and then moved from home to an unknown location.
Residential agreements are paid on account of B&amp;B
The United Kingdom Housing Contracts can account for an amount of 80 million English pounds in excess of the Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank after redemption.
The government has spent 14 billion pounds on the protection of members of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
This loan will be paid by all companies using the money of the owners, including 59 housing agreements.
According to Adrian Coles, President of the Association of Residential Contracts (BSA) that companies and their members should be paid.
The 14 billion key exchanges will be reimbursed after the return of Bradford &amp; Bingley's notes.
However, it is estimated that during the current year, cash flows can be attributed to the 700 financial companies that use loans.
The Financial Services Board confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing agreement is also one of them.
It is ironic that the institutions that are still operating ... must now pay the accounts of those institutions which were less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We know that all companies need to be paid in such a way that the amount of cash is in the bank, and companies share 18% of the costs between them.
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, the amount of credit will reach 450 million points in 2009.
This means that companies need 81 million points to pay for the first year's payments.
Adrian Coles, head of the company's housing company company, told the BBC that he was wrong to take the measure.
"It is desirable that institutions should pay the accounts of less prudent institutions which have gone around during the adjustment of the housing market."
According to the BSA, no single company has been affected since their operation began in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to examine this case in the next few weeks in order to allow us to protect the housing companies and their members from the significant amount of accounts," he added.
The annual ceiling in 2009 shall be eight months from the end of this year from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, a full-year fee is to be paid, which can be even the present two.
Since the housing agreements are self-helped organisations, without participation, the members will eventually have to pay the account either at higher prices or at lower rates after their entry.
The milk price rises by five pounds per literate
In Jersey people have to pay more for the oil.
Jersey's company announced that it would raise its wholesale price by five more per litres a week.
This is the second increase since the increase in two pennies in February and after an examination by a consulting company.
The respondents decide whether to increase prices to consumers.
Before the fall of February, the price of Jersey milk for wholesale trade changed to the last one in 2002.
The former representative of Bangladesh was denied the request for freedom of movement
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request for protection from former parliamentary representative Sheikh Hasina, who was free to return to the country, which meant that they could be detained when they returned to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to protect him from the charges in connection with the claim that 50 million copies of a businessman were withdrawn from him at the time of parliamentary representation (729,700 dollars).
This case is just one of the innocent charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Ziát was released this month.
Sheikh Hasinán will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his partner, the Awami League, follows that the interim government of the country, supported by the military, will grant him full freedom in advance.
According to the authorities, although it was conditionally free to be treated abroad, it is not clear from the conditions of placing the leg free to guard its freedom when it returns to the country.
Advocates say that it will now be brought before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Court of Justice has sent a request for Sheikh Hasina's advice that it is not necessary, since it has already been set free for a while and is taking part in foreign treatment," we were told by Judge Rafiqueul Huq.
"We are going to challenge the decision of the Court of Justice."
According to the defence opinion, it is therefore necessary to protect the free movement in order to return to the country and to prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina was expected to return home after October 17th.
Later, Tavay was taken into custody of the temporary government supported by the military, but in June he was released from prison for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both face charges against all of them.
Concerns about the protection programme against the Afghan polio
According to the ENSZ, at least 200,000 Afghan children remained out of the recently organised polyol protection programme due to the strength of the tabloids.
In the past week, the ENSZ has organised a six-day defence operation.
However, it was said that for safety reasons they could not come to the children living in some parts of the southern Helmand and Kandahar.
According to an ENSZ spokesman, all happened despite the promises made by the Taliban: they will not attack or impede the work of thousands of key personnel.
The BSkyB increase was rejected in relation to ITV
The entry BskyB was rejected against the decision of the Competition Commission, which directed the reduction of interest in the rival TV, in the ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its participation in ITV by less than 17.9% of 17.9%.
In the past, the Commission decided that BSkyB's participation would stop the competition and that the company would be adversely affected by ICT.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 and thus effectively prevented the NTL - which has since been called Virgin Media - from buying IT.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that BSkyB would risk the independence of ITV by encouraging the Competition Law Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virginia's manager, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's surveillance were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB concluded that the reduction in its VAT participation was to be accompanied by a pointless and uncompromising approval - in particular in view of the fact that BSkyB announced that it would be desirable to grant voting rights.
Further examination of the case of US government audits
The U.S. Supreme Court appointed a special prosecutor for the investigation of the disappearance of nine U.S. government officials in 2006.
The action was followed by the criticism of the decisions of the officials of the government by the Chief Inspector-General of the Judiciary.
The judge judged the officers of the White House, the lawyers and the former prime minister, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that government controls had been removed from political attention.
Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor, is now going to examine whether the officers who have been heard during the investigation have tried to prevent justice.
"They have not yet examined serious charges of possible crimes and have not been cleared," said Glenn Fine, the chief supervisor.
One of the main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who is empowered to witness to the Witnesses.
The series began with nine judges from the removal of the United States Legal Officer in December 2006.
They said that they had been forgiven for their poor performance.
Later, however, it became apparent that the missing government audits did not receive anything worse than many of their colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that post-derogation was due to political importance.
Some government officials participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others were not willing to take part in the investigation of the charges against the Democrats with regard to elections.
U.S. government audits carry out investigations and judicial proceedings.
They can pass, but they can't get away from their position on political issues.
The leader of the Justice Affairs Akori, Alberto Gonzales, became the main target of government attack because of the disappearances, and eventually disappeared.
The Court of Justice has tabled a number of other discharges.
Gonzales, in his report to the chief supervisor, strongly condemned the role involved in the case. He considered that the highest official "priority" was responsible for the discharges, the "responsibility" of the director, and the "expected" himself" of the process.
Other honourable officials - including Karl Rove, former Bush assistant - judge that they did not testify to cooperation during the investigation.
Get Meat Loaf eposa elliptical
The rock star Meat Loaf will be awarded recognition in the awarding gallery of Q Awards for the Episcopal Godship of Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who takes over a special gold medal at the London Festival next week, said he'd be honored.
The nine-minute, five-second-long dal Meat Loaf in 1977, was the title of the public show album.
Coldplay received most of the marks for the temporary fees, four categories were added to the list.
Paul Rees, the principal editor of Q magazine, said, "There are a few lines that cross the time or operational boundaries, and the "Bat Out Of Hell" like that."
The song bought by Jim Steinman required a lot of sound, and that was the song Meat Loafé.
The song started with a two-percent audio break.
In 1979 it became small, and it reached the 15th place.
However, the album "Bat Out Of Hell" in Meat Loaf has been present for at least nine years, and then more than 40 million examples have been provided.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Ayday - is currently struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003 it was surgery because of a heart attack, after he joined the stage.
In 2007, some concerts had to be held because of the high winding up of the mountains.
Later, it was discovered that it was found in the earphone.
Unknown city street, where they often wonder about it, and they may soon sell it.
New York City has thousands of fans, circles, and other attachments. Some of them are famous, others simply perform practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-distance local residents would find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is located in East Village, and it lies on the north side of the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between the Bowery and the Second Street.
Kb. 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much prefers to a pudder as a main road.
There are no streets.
Usually, it cannot be found on a standard map.
But there's miracles on the street.
There's, for example, Avalon Bay, the construction of the recently built First Street luxury plants.
He wants to redefine the Extra Place again, and he wants to make sure that new buildings can be sold and sold in a cleaner way.
Among the marvels of the road are the long-distance neighbors here who took it to the corner street, that it was the only one left before the changes in the surroundings.
However, the owner of the road, the city's building and development class is not interested in it.
At a meeting of the Committee on the Management of the Land of the Region on this month, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay offered a proposal that the builder would buy the road.
However, the Commission would prefer that the road remain in the city’s management and requested a new plan to be submitted in the coming month, including Susan Stetzer, the Regional Director of the Government’s 3rd Board.
"There is a very small area in the city's district, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"So there can be proposals for the renewal and treatment of Avalon, but we also want to ensure that it is available to the public."
Avalon Bay reported a few months ago that he wanted to rediscover the little street and want to stay with the tops. These are part of a coffee shop that will be used by the construction worker in the future.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first brought to public this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's dictionary says that even if the company wants to use the road, it doesn't bother to turn around.
"Avalon Bay's main focus is to renovate this damaged sinker and build a decent public place," she said, adding that the city proposed buying.
Seth Donlin, the head of the building guard's office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for the development of the buildings and not the handling of them.
For a closer neighbor, it's not very historically important for the Extra Place to Bowery.
According to some, in 1802 he received the name "skin land" when Philip Minthorne broke the big gates between his countless children, and no one was required to travel to the small land.
The Punk-Rock works closed in 2006, the CBGB back door opened to Extra Place, and the most famous photo on the street was produced there on the album cover of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great place," said Danny Fields to the Ramones manager who produced the photo in November 1976.
"He was full of clothes, clothes, leather and pastry clothes, and debts and debts."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how to take East Village into custody, are opposed to the sale of Extra Place. They believe that the property has to remain in the neighborhood of the community, regardless of the area.
Others refer to the Extra Place as a resort, which is a city's remains virtually unchanged, and which must be left at peace.
Jeremiah Moss, a blog writer called "New York's missing" ("The Book of Sirals: a brief narrative of the city's appearance"), posted a blog entitled "The New Yorker" on Extra Place, which appeared in 1952 in the headlines entitled "The New Yorker" on the weekly "Various Speech".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a small, small box that is still dark in the day, which has been cut off, which has been cut off from glass-made tractors and spaceships, and where there are several news on the streets."
The road, apart from some exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A package was passed through at the end of the road, with the back door that led to the CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher price-added box.
There was a graffiti on the side, and an empty, 0,75 litres of beer palack was covered with an old, fresh paper.
A few drivers said that the Extra Place would soon be on their way, but they think it would be better if the upgrades were to be made.
Fields said that it seems that some underestimated the beauty of the street in the current state of affairs.
He said, "I have spent most of my life in darkness, open and unwelcome places."
Discussion on bilingual education: Further insight into the English language environment
In this part of the course, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Isumi discussed their views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher and director of the California Studies Institute in the Csendes-Ocean Common Policy Research Institute and the director of education, is entitled "Not as good as you think: Why is there a need for a high school education opportunity?"
It is not easy to get in the favor of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
The recommendations related to Barack Obama's education are also included here.
Obama's campaign says "Afro-American and Spanish private students are significantly less likely to receive a diploma than the white students," and that is true.
In order to overcome these differences in performance, Obama has explicitly supported the educational plan - among other things - "temporarily bilingual education" for English students.
At the same time, for Obama the question is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which is based on non-English school education, is of interest in overcoming major performance differences.
Take, for example, the 6th Street Prep contract general school in the eastern part of Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of the students, who have recently arrived, learn English.
In spite of this, 100% of the fourth graders have achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics study.
It is equally amazing that 93% of the fourth graders were performed in an excellent way in the English language and in the office.
This incredible performance was not valued by the tool that Obama would share.
Sixth Street is the seat of the voice for repetition, practice, continuous assessment of the preparations and for refusal of seizures.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street School, the principle of education for students who learn English is "full degree in understanding" in the language environment.
The method of evaluation is the unique use of English in teaching other subjects.
Michaels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said, "We've shown the first success in getting someone to a classroom, you wouldn't notice who was the student who came back from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It works," he said, "We work."
Would Obama set the following example for other, significant numbers of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking schools to teach schools such as the Six Street Prep?
The results of the school should be clear in order to make the choice, but because of their own learning policy (the National Educational Unions support bilingual education for a long time), and since they are consequently different from bilingual education, we cannot be certain of Obama's reaction.
Although it was agreed that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made an excellent statement on the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "excessively speaking English" of the law.
Instead, she said, "They should be able to speak Spanish to their children."
If Obama really wants to get rid of the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking at them and getting them into nothing.
The price of oil has always been caused by concerns related to the economy
On Monday, I am afraid that the oil industry will not be able to restore the economy because of the concern that the US financial markets will not be able to cope with.
The seven percent of the profit paper was returned to New York's Business Office at $99.80 before it was settled.
Prices fell by more than $20 every week.
In the past two weeks, the stock market has opened up the Wall Street financial grid, and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price reached $145.29 on a Wednesday in July, at least $90 on a Wednesday at the beginning of this month would have been returned before the financial markets would have been affected by the irreconcilable uncertainty.
In the afternoon, concern was again expressed to investors even after the congressional leaders had reported that they were able to agree on the economic recovery that counts for the greatest in the history of the school.
The news has raised concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for long.
As the most recent event of the emerging crisis, the Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation bank business, the government announced on Monday.
In time, the European financial conglomerate, Fortis, was established by the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments.
According to the Barclays Capital analysis, as a result of the two-week bilateral agreements, "it seems that the treatment failed to compensate for the benefit of trade in cash."
As the economic situation deteriorates, goods, such as oil, are expected to decrease.
"The future of the market for heritage, stock exchanges and currency exchanges would become a worldwide phenomenon," the Deutsche Bank wrote an analysis of investors.
"We don't think the market for goods will be going to get rid of the "pocket."
In terms of commodity, the biggest question is how much the US "disease" affects the whole world, especially with regard to China."
As a result of the slowdown in economic growth, oil consumption has decreased, the Bank's expectations for the next year's benchmarks have been reduced by 20%, with indications of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The record of the team set up with your second four bravors
After spending more than eight months in Jet's jungle than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played the defensive end, thought he had seen everything.
But then he saw your second four out of the market on Sunday when Jets changed a game without a point into a sensory game.
"I've never seen that before," said Ellis.
Your second quarter then began that the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully in harmony with the dark skyscrapers.
Brett Favre, a quarterback 12-year-old touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This became a perfect advance for a day-to-day, during which their outstanding cooperation continued significantly.
Favre gave Coles another two touchdown pass in this fourth, among others, when two cornerbacks followed each other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret poverty," Favre said about all the pass for Coles.
"Very good players.
So far, we've been able to communicate with each other, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles were kidnapped, the defense stopped Cardinals' manager, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, who was in the corner back position, caught a bad bag and returned with 32 yards, which touched down.
Eric Smith, a safe player in the middle of another pass, and he got the ring.
David Bowens, the linebacker was able to pull the trigger out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing mozzana in the race.
However, when Cardinals lost the blade before the end, and Jets got it, Jay Feely was hit by 20-year-olds, setting up the score of 34:0.
This was the best result that Jets had ever had in a quarter.
When asked by Jet's teacher Eric Mangin to mark the highlight of the game, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When they told him that both of them - the third quarter of Cardinals had received 21 points that the Jets had not bought anything - Mangini said, "I have to say that I enjoyed your second quarter much better than the triad.
We've got a lot of points in a short time."
The guest Gebrselassie has adopted his own world order.
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie again showed why they kept many of the best medium and longevity ever lived when he set his own world record in Berlin on Sunday. This made him the first one who spent 42,2 km 2 hours in 4 minutes.
The comfortable snowboard, 2:03:59, successfully reached Gebrselassie 27 seconds ago at 2:04:26, which he met in Berlin.
For 35 years, Gebrselassie has established 26th World War II in so many areas that from 1500 meters to the Marathon, it has gained all the world unity, or world record.
A month ago, Gebrselassie left the Pekini Olympic Marathon - which, in return, may have proved too careful - that air pollution continues to cause asthmatic problems.
Instead, he was invited to Berlin's marathon.
At least between perfect conditions - at the start of the day at 9 °C and at the end at 13 °C - Gebrselassie won Sunday, unbelievably, 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the marathon did not start earlier, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to the longest distances, the marathon record has decreased over two minutes in the past few years since Brazil gained Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 from 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago her legs had been broken and she couldn't teach for two weeks.
Obviously, he was frozen under the heavy rain and did not grow up.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"It's all made perfect.
A week ago, I started teaching again, and today was my doubts, but it's all right."
A few criticisms - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's East-African Rivalis - have been used too much resources during the competitions, usually avoiding many world-facing marathons, leaving them on hold, as if they were flying in a ball, and the world conditions are heading for competition.
However, this criticism almost reduces the magnitude of Gebrselassie in the long run.
Gebrselassie came to the summit at 1:02:04 on Thursday with four Kenyan rockets operating.
Two-week Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the rockets were formed.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometres before the goal, Gebrselassie left Kambai with a last sprint, which was the second time for the goal at 2:05:36, with 5 minutes to improve one's best.
Kamathi entered as a triad at 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, has spent a year worth paying attention to the seventh victory, 2:19:19.
The world party is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25 p.m.
Last summer, after 36-year-old Mikitenko's surprise, he won the score of the London marathon at 2:24:14.
He was unable to take part because of an opportunistic attack on the Beijing Olympics, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he was five minutes older than his own. This was the third marathon trip he took.
Okos won the competition by counting: he first allowed Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance a four main group, and led to a significant defeat, after 30 km.
Ethiopia Ascale Tafa Magrasa for the second time 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop was the third result of 2:25:01.
A unique city, the height and try of the blacks
In the Great Orland park of experience - for a few miles away from everything that stars, sounds, and powers - create a quiet little town where the height of the African life is high and bona fide.
Eatonville, the first clean black city to be integrated into the country, which was home to Zora Neale Hurston's children, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: "The five toes, three toes, 300 toes, 300 toes, 300 towels, 300 towels, many towels and two towels, without prison."
Now you're in trouble.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the Zora festival of the year. The celebration of Eatonville is held by the most famous female writer in Harlem, Hurston.
Yet, in many respects, the city which has been described and which has made tourism - which is also an exceptional part of the Floridian journey of the Soviet Union project.
Just as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote a letter from Florida, city black people were often not willing to share their real thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know where to stay."
Even in this year when the black president, Barack Obama, has made a public impression on the kind of issue, there are a lot of mistrust about the appearances of foreigners.
"We are very concerned about how to tell our story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here for the rest of his life, and a member of the city's oldest church.
"You've got to tell me clearly."
Eatonville has long been characterized by victory and struggle with paradoxone.
At the same time, the historical importance of blackouts is a model, while at least 2400 major communities, where the poverty indicators reach the national average double.
In part, an office complex, and in part an example of the American slave trade that has been created as a result, it has sometimes been viewed, sometimes for beauty, south, city, black culture, which flourishes in the price of cotton.
It's not surprising, then, that the residents here are once proud and protective.
And the picture of Eatonville is important since Zora, (there's everyone called Hurston).
In books written in real, powerful dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Watching God" (1937) - he showed his parents the world.
The Florida road map changed five paragraphs to the city, which lies along the 17th road, from the center of Florida’s long-standing black history and human dramas to one location.
Hurston, who was courageous in life and in the office, as well as the doppelganger, introduced his readers to the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke's business, and entered the most reliable areas.
He wrote: "We are better able to find the modern public school on the ground with a white dress, with well-adjusted toys and players that Howard Miller thinks, even though he can easily write and read."
He made a mention of the new wine Dash's husband, and he wrote that Lee Glenn "all kinds of drinks at the price, and anything that may be needed at the transitional hotels."
In a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to his autonomy, but at the same time, he was not writing, repatriating, and having sex.
It's clear that Fodor's travel book showed otherwise.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Zora said things like they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters. Hurston would have made them immortal by throwing them out of the lovely pieces that men had sung about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a student who has often visited home after his family moved to the Florida Jacksonville.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin observed that when Hurston entered the city, he usually came into a cavern in Chevrolet, a cigarette, and a long distance into a city where people are still proud of their decent dress.
Most of the people were surprised, Franklin said, but many were impressed.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, looking at the tower of Sabelia, where Hurston was found with the greatest likelihood, he added, "It's never been too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer released.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with a large part of the world, got rid of it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at the Barnard University in the 1920s, he died in the Florida Fort Pierce, where he had lived before.
There were no significant reminders or major public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how rich the world was, or what he'd left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, who was born in Hurston in 2003.
The turning point came out in 1980.
Orange and her officers wanted to build five roads through the city, instead of the double main street, Kennedy, which played an important role in the life of the community.
In the same way, it was possible to enter the city’s restline with Interstate 4 cars connected with the States.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still under arrest after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, the end of the strong integration of the Community is a relatively idyllic indifference.
In the 1950 ’ s, wars involving racial discrimination led to hate with the community.
"A group of white boys went through the hall, and they broke up on the street with oranges and other things," Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in this.
They threw a Greek girl out of a car."
In 1955, Hurston, writing to the newspaper "The Orlando Sentinel", asked about the decision of the Supreme Court to establish a strong integration. Thus he declared the decision "Brown v. Board of Education": "It's no longer hurt, it doesn't respect my species."
People today say that the disaggregation of schools was so positive in some respects that it weakened the content of the eatonvilles and under the confidence of young people.
"The black kids used to kill them - I remember - the man killed his teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins, director of the non-profit organization called Meg Eatonville Community.
"It stayed until the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't kill our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, cultural differences were among us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston to raise – in black writing, coloring and art, who have grown up in standards, as he did, with such wonderful self-confidence and order as the following: “How can anyone get away from my company’s enjoyment?
That's incredible to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker was assigned to Hurston's most significant cry, and she began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, the bookstores were written by Robert E. Hemenway, a well-known life of Hurston, who re-entered the Americas.
The construction project would have begun when the most famous daughter of Eatonville was refocused.
And this time, Hurston's former neighbor was regarded as a rescuer.
In 1988 the community began to organize a Hurston festival to tell what would destroy the street with the main street.
More than a thousand delegates came to the event two years later, and since then many return to the event every January.
Well, a few years later, the ship stopped the construction proposal.
"As a result of the suspension of the main road, the community has relived, which means real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd just said, "He saved Eatonville now."
The success of the construction project has helped change the city's self-made image.
In a larger number of people outside the city, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started going to church in 1993, and the locals began to reassess the past.
In 1998 Eatonville entered the National History List.
In 2006, he opened the new, unique book called Hurston, in the newly renovated and beautifully Kennedy.
Eatonville still has Florida's catacombs: it's not only 10 km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like it's a foreign appendage at the time of the spring rain; it's as small as when 27 black families were built in the 1880s.
(But the population is 90% black.)
They're still being cautious about the aliens who come here looking for Eatonville's story.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's longest haircut, which paints a white man and works black on the ground - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville - among others, self-evident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to our life as a pirate - are afraid that they will neglect their different communities.
And yet, as Hurston's festival became ever more widespread, parental pride grew.
In particular, young people look more and more at Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own species: amazing, problems and not even worse, as well as the same proud, creative, generous, confused, confused and confused as other ethnic and ethnic groups in America.
There is a genuine civil commitment to Franklin's grandson, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to work with the local government or the police, according to which they are looking for help.
And it seems that young people have also learned to represent Eatonville properly, such as 11-year-old Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most of those who just move here think that this city is nothing compared to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after the funeral one Sunday.
"But if someone stops and just takes a little time to get to know the story, it's a very nice city."
We all speak the language of money in New York.
Nothing's changed in the top.
If tourists don't care about the newscasts and the powerful television broadcasters in Times Square, I wouldn't notice that they're in the middle of a storm.
They would never find out that the wine-growing, soft-made offices have crossed their heads with bankers and risk-taking managers who hold New York in power since 1929.
The drivers still carry out five tea cakes on the roads, sending muffin-filled bags to the morning talks.
Even in Spain, certain men are still walking between the houses of drumming men, with a five - inch - wide [5 cm] hip and a five - inch - wide [5 cm] hip, which are replaced by a straight line.
The office workers are still in line for their breakfast breakfast at the train's restaurant and still cannot get a taxi on Monday between 4 and 7.
I didn't feel that there would be any crisis until, despite all the alarming news in the morning, I didn't decide to give you a new bank account.
I've been planning to get things done in the days of the Daylights, but I've got 20 people in front of my JP Morgan Chase bank.
Not on the banking board where money can be bought or paid, but on the customer service, where old customers have a check-in box, tourists ask for guidance in Macy's shop, and where new customers open the bank account.
A lot before me - I knew about Start later, from my "ordered" banker - as well as my heart was in line as I was.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their money out of smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was taken out of so-called trust banks (such as housing agreements), credit agreements, and small bank funds that operate only in a single country and are treated as a permanent family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been ruined in silence.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in cash, was under mortgage, and when New Yorkers came home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank purchase of $440 billion.
The offices and bots in front of me were transferred to a bank, which seemed to be a safe waste, to the bank, where most capital injections were carried out on Wall Street.
The simple New York people have become skilled in their finances for the past few weeks.
A woman in the local Chinese store phoned to talk about Lehman Brothers Bank and the powerful executive director, Dick Full, as if he were complaining about a bunch of colleagues.
And Lynn, my apartment's house is a five-year-old, final Sunday theme, not about Brad and Angelina, or about my food supply, as we used to do.
So he said to me after I went to the bank, "I put all my money in the money market tools.
I changed, you didn't risk it."
A Muslim voice was heard while on the right side of Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, the left-hand Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, the Belgian top-left party, the Vlaams Belang, participated in a meeting in Antwerp on 17 January 2008, in a series called "The Guards of the Revolution of Islam Ellen".
Marks followed by transport tables depicting cross-sections with a red line.
According to the police, the extrapolated majority of the officials were responsible for the interpretation of the Austrian Muslim defenders, which took place at the same time during the week when the majority of the exploratory parties took a significant lead in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 complaints about a serious crash in the Trauni cemetery next to Linz, sometimes between Friday night and this morning.
Several letters were made by Jewish characters, such as David's star, but researchers have only tried to hide long - term principles that reflect the hatred of Muslims.
It is not clear whether the incident can be related in any way to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islam community said that after the funeral of the Muslim religious month, it was not long before the end of Ramadan.
At the same time, Austria has a well-known survey following the parliamentary elections of the day, during which political measurement is better marked.
The two sides, which received at least 30% of the votes, were campaigning for the future of the Freedom Party and the Association of Austria, for a strong immigration law, and some of their slogans were sent to foreign critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party, who holds more than 18% of the votes against the leaders of the campaign against the leaders and the bourgeoises, has also completed its assessment of the fight against Islam in relation to food.
The party spoke of "European brotherhood" at the final, monetary gathering, which would help to prevent the strengthening of Islam.
He wants both sides to prevent the construction of museums and mines in view of the political symbols of their exploitation in Austria and Europe.
According to the opinions and analyses carried out following the most successful elections, the change was thanks to the majority of young people who were concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter was banned from a foreign trip.
Gary Glitter, who was accused of child abuse, was known as a rock star in the court of France and Spain.
The judges then decided to stop Glitter for six months to inform the supervisory authorities of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The county police officers received a ban on the journey after giving evidence of the court's judgements against Glitter, which had been brought against the children.
Glitter, actually Paul Gadd, was not involved in the Ashford Magistrates negotiations, but the Corker Bining attorney was represented.
One court speaker said: "On 25 September, the county police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court to ban Paul Gadd's planned visit to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd doesn't mean it personally."
64-year-old Glitter therefore informed the authorities of the purpose of foreign travel, as this is required by the law on the registration of perpetrators of sexual offences.
It shall notify the authorities of their intention to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also necessary to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If he does not notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
The county police said they don't want Glitter to go into private cases and talk about his situation.
We learned from the Kenyan police spokesman: "The Kenyan police will do everything in the protection of children in the country and abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to check someone if he does not leave the United Kingdom because there is a comprehensive system for us to be able to handle potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kenyan police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continue to monitor the behavior of the persons involved in the reporting of sexual crimes and those living in the rest of the world, to minimize the potential risks of the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the rape of a 10-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to be driving to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad, and he had no intention of flying to London.
The territorial authorities did not allow the travel inspection to be carried out, so they finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities did not allow them to enter the country, so they returned to Bangkok, where territorial police and immigration authorities forced them to return to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow airport terminal 3 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, did not go to the London court,uxbridge, because, according to the request of Scotland Yard, he was sentenced to a court trial in order to register sexual crimes.
Glitter spent four months in prison to bring back pictures of the forced training of children in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a local ministry source, Jacqui Smith, a local government official was satisfied and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't make the photos on the screen because I want to show the artist on a personal page."
There's no dessert, no bread, no dancing.
From the front of the flamenco Grandmaster's body, the action was without any excitement: to get to know the face of the dancers' weekly.
From time to time, art.
On the other hand, the man on the weekend.
And these two pages can't be separated, except in moments away from intimate, public moments, when we can afford a personal movement, we can capture the depth of an image, or we can focus on the beauty of an art that is really, really, very expressive.
The German photo series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people combines the theatre of musicians, dancers and guitars with this less-known weekly page.
The photos show the private iconography of Flamenco from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Film Film Festival, "shows the increasing international importance of Flamenco on the day," says the actor, adding that the Flamenco-people could be anyone's actor, because when the images were seen, the viewer noticed that these images were not typical of painting the works.
These people on the street are the ones who are able to take pain, sadness, pride to the stage... and ruin the public.
At the same time, the photos are not suitable for the capture of their personality.
Their personality and character live in the most personal.
I'd like to create a massive atmosphere that allows me to acquire the personality of the Grand Flamenco."
The Cante de las Minas festival opened a long way to Bauer in 1997, with a flash camera on flamenco songs, guitars and dances.
These portraits show the classic photo of the camera and the theme selection.
However, the use of various stylistic instruments is different from the drawing of the traditional image, and modernism. The next thought reflects the thought of Bauer from the flammoral: "This music with traditional dances, however, changes every day and is always surprising."
It's not the dance, it's not the song or the song itself, it's much better the artist's personality, it's a character that's a sign of the public.
In the days of the El Photoma gallery, the driving force of the actions can be seen with the essence of the meeting with the artistic device, which can be seen through the sensation, the existence and the way of the display.
The famous characters of the flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, reflect this collection of art that will be shown in six months.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon produce an album corresponding to the portraits presented on the exhibition.
Bauer, who had suffered for two years as a athlete, was forced to repeat the idea with the series "SportART Project" (SportART Project).
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is somewhat different from this, the artist adds: "I don't like to see people, get to know them and enter them for a longer or less moment in their lives.
I think the photo is the easiest feature of the portrait.
You meet people you meet, people you don't know, people you meet, people you don't even know, or people who only take a few minutes to take pictures.
But despite these circumstances, I always try to carry out my ideas.
The exhibition of Flamenco-people, chosen from the short flamenco portraits, shows the Alameda de Hérculess with parous calle de la Mata 20 can be seen in El Fotomata Gallery until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa says the rain that works, "be careful of wakefulness"
The scene and the action are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also busy writing his new novel. The main director of the region is a nationalist, Roger Casemant, who spent a hundred years in Congo and Amazon.
The Irodalmi Nobel Prize was also an opportunity writer at Hay Festival Segovia's event yesterday that his current work "precise alertness" and "all signs show that the kingdom should not be written".
"If I were more reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and hope that I will do it at some point at the end" - with these words he closed his presentation at the festival of essays, thoughts and opinions, which he held in the city of Aqueduct for four days, hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and visitors.
"The city and dogs" was one of the largest participants in the office's festival, and it also changed its hopes.
Vargas Llosa won a prize with Hay Festival, a former edition of the Dickens "Our Single Friend" by participants.
Félix Romeo accepted the audience's offer. The audience soon got to the hour when he told the audience about the time when the Peruvian writer was able to recall and give a high dose of humour how he was made out of his unique passion for reading and the desire to live; how he was able to pass through his writings by means of a well-recorded written method, with excellent documentation, many corrections and re-enactments; how he was able to write to Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memories are the stories of his works.
The Latin American registrant acknowledged that it was impossible to detect or demonstrate whether the books were changing our lives, but added: "I don't think that the office has an empty experience of entertainment or entertainment," because it has an effect on people and thinking of them, so he asked the writers not to allow them to read easily and act on their responsibility.
As a result of the current process, the Pozoblanco boutiques will remain
The traditionally organized horse-carveded yesterday as the closing season of Pozoblanco was removed from the metro after the rest of the horse trolleys found the arena ground unusable on the way.
As a result, the Commission agreed with Fermín Bohörque, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to remain with the Bicavia.
The timetables were based on the agenda, since no two of the three agendas could be kept.
Szombaton was left with the second bicavia because of the fall.
The leading players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblancó bikes would have fought.
That's how it was held on Friday.
The victorious Daniel Luque, who took three wings home as a trophies.
In the same day, Alejandro Talavante received a number of recognition and trophies through two bikes in the south, but he was more grateful to the public than he could have had.
After that, however, El Juli, who was less involved in advancing the fame of the Los Llanos Arena.
After the second bikini went to a comfortable place, most of the audience managed to get out of the basement.
On average, a two-ton start-up vehicle has tried to escape road control
It's four o'clock in five minutes.
The BASK Field Police is carrying out marketing checks in the administrative area of Arminé (Alava).
The Authority shall establish a vehicle in which two passengers are travelling, and the passengers shall try to avoid the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of starters, was still not visible.
The investigators took the roads, and one of them, a 28-year-old man was arrested, and was identified by A.J. - published by the Federal Government of the Basque Republic.
He's accused of drug trafficking and abuse of alcohol.
The case took place in the administrative area of Arminé, where the company of the Álavi Forgalmi Supervision has carried out a marketing check on the N-1 car.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to listen, gave immediate gas, and left the control station.
The investigators were taken to the station, then a few miles away from the vehicle, and the passengers were on their way from the car to a forest area.
Finally, the Basque Regional Police took one of them, and after examining Iveco Daily's truck, he took over his shipment of 2178 kilograms.
The rear of the vehicle was sent by the police to carry out a thorough investigation and to test the drug.
In addition, during the verification, it was confirmed that the vehicle’s false registration table does not correspond to the data contained in the vehicle’s paper, and therefore the procedure is also initiated because of the infringement of the infringement.
The BASK Regional Police shall continue to investigate, in part, the detention of another suspected suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, has been removed from the parking lot, and the origin of the prescribed drug.
The 28-year-old accused, A.A. J., was sent to the police to raise the necessary hearings, and the court proceedings began within a few hours.
Heather Locklear has been arrested for taking his medicine
Heather Locklear was arrested last week by the police in Santa Barbara (California) for taking the medicine.
According to one observer, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito - a spokesman for the People magazine of California’s Business Supervision.
According to the eyewitness, about 16 hours a.m. Locklear's "has already printed the gas, has increased the engine, forward and back, and has tried to leave the parking lot, and several times in the back of the day."
Not much later, the viewer who probably didn't know the actress at first saw Locklear standing in a nearby car park and getting out of the car.
He also informed the police because he was "deprived of Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the dancer was sitting in his car, which partially damaged the traffic of his car.
"It seemed closed," so the drivers went to a specialized centre for a drug and alcohol study.
According to a police spokesman, the dancer was co-operated and the alcohol consumption was released immediately. The speaker also said that based on the first pressure of the officers, they thought that Locklear was under the influence of Locklear.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of being led by an unknown force. About 19 hours were sent to the local prison, where they were released a few hours later.
Locklear came out two months ago from an arison scenario where he was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares uses the IU (United States of America) analogue federation to act in the Silva region
Gaspar Llamazares, U.S. Secretary-General and Representative of the United States today announced that the bottom regional federation will make a decision in the case of Youth and Sport Council of Seville, Francesco Manuel Silva.
"I am a federalist in these things, and this is evidence of the influence of the Andalusian organization," he pointed out to Llamazares the procedure that the party had to apply to a member of the Sevilla City Council.
On the other hand, the IPU president stressed that, in the event of the possible irregularities imposed by Silva, the "visibility" must be kept in mind: "The IU has always been sent to silence, so that such cases can be maximumly transparent."
He added that part of the training was "the strict ethical code in the case of advertising."
"Majussi blood", Garci's epicos alcots
Benito Pérez Galdós National Episods, a work called the National Episcopals, was performed by José Luis Garciti, who is the most famous Spanish filmmaker in May, with a budget of nearly 15 million euros.
According to this, the director has tried to illustrate the amazing human nature and social analysis of the art of the known regenerator. All today, he told Garci about the popular audience of the films.
More than two and a half hours of Mayian blood is shown in the music Friday, and later it will take four hours as a minimum of Telemadrid.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' office, has made this discovery a childish dream. All thanks to Esperanza Aguirré, he trusted three years ago from Madrid Tartomán to prepare a film for the 200th anniversary of the events of May 2nd. Garci accepted the request on the basis of the history of the National Episcopals.
The 15 million budget was funded entirely by the Madrid Autonom Tartom, and Garci had a special opportunity: it could show in time of disillusionment and signage "the lost Spaniards who were led by mistrust, as the fight continued for independence led to a severe loss of control of the country by Ferdinand."
The director also expressed his regret that the Mayis blood could not be counted with the Alatriste or Goya's phantom budget, which was due to double pay. Thus it was necessary to leave a few signs from the shop book, which - as well as many other times - are associated with Horacio Valcárcel.
So the Rehabilitation Order went on to the usual working mode, with the colorings that started the tests before the auction. Casting wasn't because Garci held the "sacrifice" and because, as he said, "the part of the conductive ceremony goes into the theater and music to find out what's going on in the industry we're working on."
The Mayis blood has many colors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci - with four Oscar marks and an Oscar era - believes that the time of Spain's pre-Hollywood Academy, namely the Mayis blood, the Hét France's billboard, and the final Vac orchestra, is the young generation of Spanish music, said.
Garci doesn't care about his film.
"At first you think you're working for the last time, you'll realize that only happiness counts, and you're already happy when another movie is prepared," says Garci after 30 years of professional research.
Isabel Bayón celebrates the life and art of the seville dancer Tötola Valencia
A sevilla flamenco dancer remembers a sevilla dancer.
Carmen Törtola Ferrer, a mother of Italians (Florrenç Törtola Ferrer) and analus (Georgia Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana in the fourth year of her life and moved with her parents to London.
The free dance was an art and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his life as a leader, he fought for women's equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought against the burning of women's freedom of movement.
The dance and aesthetic revolution broke out in war in Europe, and it took Isabel Bayon his life.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gambo, and he suggested to Tórtol, who was really impressed by his personality."
The flamenco dancer declared the following: "Our goal is not to tell the story of life, but to accept the inspiration.
From the title of their dances, flamenco styles came into mind.
For example, "fucking dance" to the gooja, or "good dance" to the tango.
"Servedly dancing and others say that it also means my style," he says.
The light of the presentation is a two-year-old instrument: Miguel Poveda, after the Open door, now sings again to Isabel; and Matilda Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with a former teacher.
"Matilde manufactures the oldest Tötrol, the elderly lady.
I'm glad he said yes to the request, and he's very honored to be on the train.
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga performers and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Pajaro plays the Rafa El Viola wedding, and Juanfra Juárez, who "is playing a constant character with love for the true prize."
In most cases, it also shows the lives of a woman who lives in London, but also enters Europe, and is still far away, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I'd like to remind her of her because her personality had a great effect on her own time, but today they don't know her work and they still appreciate her work less," says Bayón.
The presentation takes place tonight at 20 o'clock at 30 o'clock in the Lope de Vega cinema.
Triennium is also shown at the end of "A fresh married exchange day"
The first illustrated edition of a fresh married couple's day will be in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916, Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia. The present will be part of the program series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) which was organized by the Andalus Regional Cultural Commission for the fifth anniversary of the award of the Irodalmi Nobel Prize and the anniversary of their two deaths.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are closed to the re-examination of the above-mentioned event, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize-winning Memorial, and the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Light Bear". The exhibition opened in May of the year and opened several Italian provinces and, according to plans, visited the International Congress at the time of the International Congress in New York.
The Andalus Regional Cultural Commission has taken up a total of eight hundred examples published by Perdo Taberenro and described by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso on a fresh married day to simplify the reputation and work of one of the most educated and unemployed.
Not without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God causes perfect humans to die.
Paul Newman was like that."
The song comes from a dancer named Sally Field, who works with Newman in a video called the Sentence Victims, and reflects on the horror and incomprehensibility that Newman's death in American music has caused in America.
And how hard it was to get Oscart.
returned in 2007,
and he was in the middle of a disease,
But that's how he saved everyone from death.
"Sometimes our feelings of incompetence are expressed in words, and now I have lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, among other things, "and he has made my life better and this country better."
No one was afraid that they might become ridiculous or overreached.
One of the heroes of music and home went through a particularly dark period in which fear of terrorism and market conditions, American self-assessment and the search for duality.
When such difficult times come and it's very easy to lose the opportunities and so few people we can look at, it doesn't have to be Luis Cernudán to surprise Paul Newman.
In fact, in humans, it has served as a law of goodness and justice.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and was a protector of lost and winning cases, starting with the birth of a child who was lost in the treatment process, from the anti-drug foundation to the establishment of the bio-food market in the home.
There was a real gift for a country that could hardly survive the culture of suicide.
My first miracle was to buy Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman, Daniel Craig, is not a man, but a group of people died with him.
Another English, Oscar loaner Sam Mendes declared that his joint work with Newman clearly indicated his short-term success.
Russell Crowe, a bad guy from Australia named Newman the biggest fan.
"He has made a lot of money for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who today seek to follow Paul Newman's way of life: they demand respect and self-responsibility from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's all possible with our media today.
There's still someone who's trying, and Paul Newman's picture.
He was married once, but after five years in a loyal marriage to Joanne Woodward, and all of a sudden, it would have been a lot of use to the cold.
"Why did you have a hamburger waiting for the cold meat at home?" he smiled.
It can be proud of the fact that the girls on the ground are also very aggressive, which is not too common in America.
"Of all the creations there was not so much pride in the role of a faithful man, a loving father, a caring grandpa and a generous man," they say.
A hard drive of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many dream a Madrid Olympic, and after 2012 failed, it may be from 2016.
But I'm asking, are we really ready for it?
Because if we get out of the train yesterday, I don't think so.
They called it a perfect race, but I see it was the worst of the many I've ever seen.
Dissensitivity has become increasingly evident, and if I should be evaluated once, and I would be the investigator, of course, the result would be clear.
Well, let's move on and start at the beginning.
The misunderstandings started with the translation of the series, so it had to be done earlier.
This isn't a problem in itself, but if you're going sooner, at least give it everything once (including the chip, in the later round).
Well, that's not what happened.
First of all, the series was passed only (first misunderstanding, therefore only to be sent earlier) and (after the usual position), which was only S-es pole (other meaning since I had XL point)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or have they decided that because of the crisis, they're going to burn the material, and they're just taking smaller, smaller pulses?
But anyway, these things are still falling apart from what happened on the day of the race.
In addition, in the early spring, the chip had to be crossed, the stand was held for 15 minutes from arrival, and even the rear was to be removed.
The expectation continued for 35 minutes, which is impossible in the case of more than 11,000 passengers.
So, as expected, the competition started, and we haven't given up on the back, when it ended, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made more than 40 minutes of waiting, which has been described as population and stand-up trials.
I think we're going to get some research interview tomorrow at 500, and some of us, including myself, not with our real time, but with our location.
If you were to ask me about the perfect racer, it wouldn't seem to come to my mind.
So I think we can go on dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Search for Microsoft (virtual) recipe
At the MIT Summit on Technology, Microsoft has shown the development of a new representative and human interaction system, one of which is - not too intelligent - professional intelligence, but capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or a vehicle operating in the area of Microsoft) on the basis of the information learned from the conversation.
This "receptional" camera and a form and facial recognition system enables you to identify how many are in the room, who they are - actually, to note what they are wearing - and to hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
It is also able to group the present on the basis of the discussions.
The video presented by the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company she is talking to and that the company is not using.
Ask him if he came to visit someone and ensure that he will soon be able to help him.
It's all blue without a big picture.
It's amazing.
But, of course, it's his future song.
At present, the company has a more important task, such as developing a new version of Windows operating system.
A lot of people have been arguing that Microsoft's strategy has changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and will contain smaller output programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computer were to run instead of the many commercial features, the necessary programs would be five times faster - Bravo, Steve, this is already something.
They found the Spanish alphabet, pointing out that Microsoft has already added functions and extracts to Windows in every new version.
The change in direction is delayed.
Microsoft's right, the operating system is getting closer to the back, and you're the software.
When Google Chrome showed up on the network, I also joined the idea that Google took the first step to make Windows competition.
Many correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be required, because I have an inexhaustible element for hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to his mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the operating system must be calculated, not absolute, but relatively relatively.
Ballmer's speech this week supports this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
We only connect the computer to open Firefox or Explorer or Chrome and more time turned into navigation than we spent in the cloud world.
What, though, is most of the applications associated with the system?
The smaller times more.
And Windows 7 is smaller, well, it needs to be smaller than VISTAN.
It's less difficult, less literal, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to further integrate its services online and ultimately to make an alternative to Google.
Everything they need, I'll tell you an example of why.
I prepared this photo at the beginning of the month in an open-ended interview for Microsoft users in Redmond.
"Your nurse, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google for online browsing.
On the other hand, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was reported last week.
It's not starting in 2009, but it's going to end, actually, rather in 2010.
Microsoft's probably trying to buy Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the cell phone's still working as a computer.
But the trick, because Android and iPhone are already on the market, is going to run business anyway.
The Fabuleux Marcel
This was done by Pablo Picasso at Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino at the base of Francis Ford Coppola, and this is also one of the basics of the nearby gay shopping community.
And if we are already dealing with the particulars, we can also trust the peaceful figure of the heavy burden of the war circle.
But what are we talking about?
It's about "tank" as English people call it, but none of them can compete with Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of an elegant name - even friends mention only "Marcel" - which is thanks to sport, according to legend, Marcel Cerdan received the name of a lover of the same artist, Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton, unisex style, his own brand, and the small (almost known) belga, also appears among his competitors. This is the last of the most famous models to be hidden in the Polish ring.
But the Belgian company's not just making tanks.
Sport leaders, retro boxers, casmologists, coaches, seafarers, baroques, ministers - and we would like to see them - all of them in the company's products.
And all of them belong to the category of comfortable basements,
I'm sorry that they have to be treated as underprivileged.
That's too good.
"I'd like to be a young mother; everyone who's gonna be the father."
She's very much like her brother, but she's been able to realize herself.
Monica Cruz is small and beautiful, but she's full of energy.
Now the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of the diva.
For Monica, modeling means more than a few beautiful and beautiful girls give a name to something.
It was present in the promotion of the new Paris branch of Mango and in the transmission of the most prestigious dividends sponsored by the Spanish company.
You've got the courage and patience from your side.
In fact, what are you doing in Paris?
We show Mango's new collection of birthdays, which we have planned with my brother, Penelope. We also participate in publishing Mango Fashion Awards' second bid and in the celebration of Valentino's honor in the Opera.
It's a pretty good day, really, but it's really exciting.
This is the fourth season of Mango's company.
We both love the 50s and 60s music, and we've got a lot of things out there.
And then, many times, I'm just going to the city, and I'm watching women dress how they change their clothes and pick up their clothes - that's one of my favorite birthdays.
You work as a dancer, a dancer and a dramatist.
I think that too, but at the end of the day, these three things are related, because there are so many of them.
I've been interested in clothes since I was a little girl, and I've been waiting for my grandfather to come and get dressed in my grandpa's clothes.
Well, you were on the Cana, you almost got up with a glass bar.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
You know what dancers want to figure out our own style for the hours and the trials to make us feel good when we look at the picture.
And in the role of dancers, you're actually identical to your role when you get the mark.
You see, it's all about everything, and I respect all his plan and his skills.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no!
I feel better than ever, I love 30 years.
I think women are in real trouble at the time, they've already had enough experience and they've made less mistakes in their lives.
And the biological clock isn't scary.
I've been doing what I like since I've been young, and it's filled with great inner happiness.
And would you like to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born as a woman, I really want to be a young mother, and I don't want to leave this in any way.
And whatever it is about your stepfather, it's all who's gonna be.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just take a few words from the movie, and you've probably bought more movies that you haven't shown.
Sure, and I'm just waiting for them to come out.
I'm the one who started at the theater. I'm very patient and calm, I want everything right now, but I know it's impossible.
I can hardly wait to show you the last hour and the Lord's day.
I'm curious what you're saying to them...
If I know, you've been arguing with Naomi Campbell for a few days.
Well, no, that's why it's not true...
I didn't go out like a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he has just invited a beauty dramatist to London, who has arranged for his own organization, women for a better world. I have chosen two my own Mango collections.
People don't even know how nice Naomi is.
There's so many things about it, so I know it, and I can make sure it's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked for the drama show, but if he wanted me to stand up, I'd do it.
If women in the third world are in the race for tea, they don't know how to do it.
Returning old leaders will be obliged to sign "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior, following a three-way management regulation, would be obliged to establish a vehicle which would prevent the vehicle from being started if the driver is in an emergency condition or does not fall into the structure.
The proposal was extended in June and is now being discussed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor, according to which the pilot project will last for a year.
Since the project aims to return to the market, the driver will also have to participate in a retraining course.
The test shall also be carried out by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Authority for Auto Safety Technology (FITSA).
According to statistics, 30-75% of the cars arrested for driving several times as a result of the accident are back in the car.
This would prevent Alkolock because the system is connected to the vehicle to determine the level of inlet air alcohol. If it is larger than the allowed one, or if the driver is not in the equipment at all, the system does not allow the car to be started.
The cost of more than 1000 euro instruments would cover the regular value.
A 2007 U.S. study confirmed that vehicles equipped with such equipment could also reduce the number of regulations by up to 65 per cent in the first year of training.
In Spain, estimates indicate that 115 people could save their lives by this rule.
The measure also focuses on two aspects: in part, it is easier to prevent the spread of crime,
In other words, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is in the normal context, while the necessary legal amendments to the criminal reform need to be amended.
The operation in the Spanish market is not yet available in any commercial form, although some industrial and public service vehicles have already been sold in an experimental mode.
The House of Lords will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which, for the example of France, will ensure that the system meets the schools.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With the accuracy of Angola, at the time announced in the programme, the air carrier Asturiasi Hercegi Park was landing in Hungary, the president of the city of Benito Juárez, Mexico.
The day was already in progress, but it was still so hot that we could only see a royal party coming out of the plane as our opponent.
There were Spanish grandmothers and other rare personalities on the steppe.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street, you know that the Spanish Hercegi Par is coming to the city official.
- Well, well, it's a good time, so today there's not going to be a repfer transfer... a woman's infamous or something like that...
No, no, sir, the woman in Spain, she's only lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press knows everything about Asturias Hercegi Par and the importance of their visit.
Many are expected to be in the red sky at the airport, on the 27th of the ocean floor, which is protected by the authorities.
It appears that the Heart, with its smiles, in sea clothing, and the Virgin, is in the long hair of the soul, in restored clothes, but not in the usual, hair-extinguishing clothing - may have been warned that Mexico is in danger of being threatened.
They stop and smile at the cameras and then enter the area where the official approval takes place.
In the hotel’s head – one of the four largest hotels in the city – is one of Mexican television’s third-party reporters.
The lowest diaphragm
The most suitable place in the world is Paris, and among the living theaters today, Valentino is the smallest and most popular.
Mango recently hosted the second bid of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims at international recognition of its youthful abilities.
It's $300,000.
Last night, Sandrina Fasoli, the first Belgian winner of the bid at the Paris Boulevard Haussmann under 54, saw his own design clothes, and made it easy for him to do so.
Accordingly, this company opened the second largest European business and recently opened it in 1335 meters.
The biggest business is located in London.
At the end of the summer event and the words of thanks to Valentino for his military presence, we found ourselves in the Paris Garnier Opera at a luxury.
In Chagalok's most famous company, the table of president prepared by Mango was still more visible.
Nati, who had recently died of a severe heart attack and a sad and sad death, carried one of the Cég's arms and some life-sustaining agents of the ELAH. He tried Valentino with his son, who was about two meters high named Luis, to attend the feast.
And then, the owner of Mango and his landlord had fun with the guests, and they were so jealous at Rotchil's club that they were finally left without clothing because they both offered it to one woman.
Monica Cruz came to the store with her own plan, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At night's opera show, she joined Gaya Toledo's company in the ballet court, and spent the old times on one of the wheels and arranged a large party company.
Inés Sastre didn't take part in the parade, but he showed some pictures of his son in front of his cell.
The next day, we met at Oliver Martinez - he'll be walking two meters high and motorily - and John Travolta came to the Paris Intercontinent Hotel. He also brought his own hats and eliminates, and he said well that he's not asking for a reservation in the room.
The stars of Paris under the stars.
Oh, that's life.
1001, stress relief number
Not 1000, but 1,000 and one way to get rid of the catholic and iron markers.
It is also good news that we can find everything in a single book that comes to the library on 30 September to bring my peace with you.
Well, it's hard to think about how fast it takes to live than it is today in today's world.
The office's name is a fraud, and his computer's back.
Stress is the public disease of the 21st century.
But there's not one or two ways to reduce day-to-day unemployment and work-related problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In the jogg-positions, classic massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution that is most convenient and convenient for free minutes.
The stress relief method includes 1001 relaxation methods and the price break from the Pearson Alhambra y DK expenditure to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that the workplace or personal relationships can at least relieve stress, this manual will certainly be free of stress.
In fact, you also serve with other ideas that help us all together, such as how to get closer to nature or how to produce 100% natural food.
If the adrenaline level is too low to refresh the body and becomes a central problem of stress life, it is time to get back to the follicle, relax and just concentrate on reading.
They're talking in dreams.
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think about those who wake up and tell the whole story about what happened to them that day, but about those who talk in bed.
At first, the scene may look like a fan, but actually it's completely harmless.
It's called sleepy sleepy sleepy sleepy.
Very often, mainly around children and pregnant women.
I'm sure most of them were told that he was talking to you last night.
For normality, it can be completely severe (e.g. only once in a high-level disease) or more frequent (day, week or month once) and usually the child does not remember anything the other day.
A review cannot lead back to only one choice.
Usually with other sleeping arrangements, such as sleeping arrangements, night sweating, night sweating (enures nocturna), or sleeping arrangements, but this is not legal.
As we have already mentioned, a high-level condition, or even an increased stress or mood disorder, may also be an inexplicable condition.
They've studied less than once.
The intensity of the speech is very different.
It may be mild, calm, consistent with words, humor, but in contrast with all of them, it may also occur that it is in the form of a cry, a cry, or a long voice.
If the presence is very intense, it is advisable to watch the child and the child turn to a professional. The study shows that there is no problem in the back and can also offer a solution.
As we have already mentioned, there is no cure for any side effects unless you are in combination with any other treatment form (e.g. sleeplessness or stress).
However, there are some things we can do, so one step ahead of time:
Let's watch the kid stay calm before he falls asleep.
We choose relaxing games and try to see the children watch scary or aggressive TV series or series.
We teach children who are prone to depression or who are suffering from depression some relaxation methods that make it easier to find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep more easily.
If you're still talking during sleep, we're trying to keep our peace.
Don't forget, this is harmless for the kids, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Practical advice
Don't raise your children.
It would be ridiculous, because the kid doesn't have knowledge, but he's gonna get out of bed.
Despite what you're talking about, she's actually sleeping and resting.
Do not be surprised if you have multiple attempts to exert a strong strain on the scene, to turn or determine what will turn out to be a major shock for the children.
If you are able to speak (this is the rarest case), do not start asking him to know anything about it.
He'd be so smart, because he doesn't know how to put all his thoughts in his sleep.
On the other hand, you just listen to the talk, but you don't see the pictures accompanying it, so be careful with the understanding of the audience and the possible consequences.
Never tell the kids they can ask their secrets at night.
It's not even funny.
It's been a very big shock.
So the most important thing is that they don't worry, because it's just a few minutes off the innocent episode.
Finally, at the same time in Illhaeusser
After a long deepening, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new plane and gained a new victory at home.
Although there were no ferret matches, the scars were made several times in a situation from which they were finally able to win one.
The pace of the contest wasn't too tight because the attackers found it hard to get the right rhythm.
The first capura shot by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann tried, but the remote lab was just about to hit the top of the capula. Then Illhaeusern came to the side and followed each other by the shootings: Funderflick tried with a remote shot, then Hirn shot by the cap. Roman spy, and Diebold, at the same time, tried to win Dannemarie's protection.
On the other side, the players were protected by a block in the middle, and only the giant Rihai was in a wooden position.
At the beginning of the second half of the year, the decisive importance arose: first Rihai and Temporale took place on the page of Dannemarie. In fact, he was born on the first floor: after the first explosion, Diebold bought a detached plate with an outstanding location of the Illhaeuserni Marais, and then he got it into the chapel (53 mins).
However, Illhausern’s goal was not to enjoy the beauty for a long time: 12 minutes later he had to leave the palace, so his team members had to continue the struggle in human form.
However, Dannemarie was unable to take advantage of it: there was no cause for concern for the household teams who were just a little behind to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds had some hope when after a great deal of encounter, the lab was very close to the cabin.
Sarkozy meets with the hot fish
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes an exit to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration by the fishermen saved a number of bridges and normal exits, so the president of the public decided to make a visit to the port of Finistère-beli Le Guilvinec in the morning to meet the representatives of the monitors.
The latter promised to accept the president "constructively" and expressed their absolute hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit will be accompanied by the meeting of the "Credentials Committee" set up by Breton fishermen with a view to taking action against the increase in gas prices, as the oil has exceeded the average of EUR 1.14 per literary record.
According to David Martin, President of the public, the President "will discuss with fishermen what solutions can help to recover their competitiveness and make seafarers more secure".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
Two mornings in Morbihan and Calvados held commercial demonstrations, with which they experienced nearly 10 km of storms.
They also saved the transport of Quiberon's jacket, but they didn't close the roads leading to Belle Island.
We've been replaced by half-toners in Quiberon.
In the morning, the seamen had already given evidence of their adventures. Then, at the end of the day, they offered rubberbranchs and rakes before the British exits, while the raids were in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This further movement was followed by the Atlantic Party and La Manche in other ports. For example, in Vendée, the fishermen did not sail to the ship while in Le Havre, about a hundred ships prevented the trade of commercial ships.
The La Turballe and Le Croisic fishing sites in Loire-Atlantic are located on the other side of the Loire-Atlantic.
The Bologne-sur-Mer fishermen, however, decided to wait for the evening session held in the ministry by a decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the same "police committee" must decide on the next step and participation in the meeting planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Bretons would not like to have the interests of the National Fisheries Commission to be represented, since the Commission did not support their duties.
"The strikes continue," because "the fishermen do not allow them to travel to Paris" and "do not intend to travel to Paris" - for example, said Liliane Cariou, president of Lorient's Fisheries Committee.
The commercial fisheries that do not pay taxes after the gas oil are currently about 50 cents in litres, but they believe that the operation of a ship would only be a result of a reduction of EUR 0,30 per litre of gas oil.
The wonderful Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boys have never forgotten their names in the Connecticut home, after 83 years of death, following cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also lost respect for their 83-year-old film and office, prior to Paul Newman.
Embraer did not change the 2008 transport plan
In spite of the global economic crisis, the Brazilian airline plans to install 215 aircraft this year.
The world's fourth largest airliner company, Embraer, is able to maintain the plans and plans to relocate 215 aircraft in 2008 - strengthened by Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company's president.
In the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
Brazil's manufacturing company is heavily concerned with the Chinese market, particularly with respect to 30-120 man aircraft.
Embraer has already spent eight years in total 41 machines for Chinese customers.
More than 15% of the instruments sold by the AIG
The US International Group, established by the financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back $85 billion for its share - it is reported that financial Times is the domain.
In addition to the international level of life insurance and the American pension insurance activities, the AIG level was replaced by a large part of the business – the news that led to resources close to the case.
According to the Times, the Board of Directors of the AIG sat on Thursday evening to examine their sales possibilities.
The AIG has not confirmed this information.
The AIG is responsible for the sale of the equipment by the company’s International Lease Financial Corp., the 59% share of the company’s transatlantic Holdings insurance company, and its own portfolio and audits - adds the Times.
According to the newspaper, however, the final decision is still not relevant to the sale.
The AIG must quickly achieve liquid assets in order to pay back $85 billion, which the US government has approved for its share, thus reducing the risk that its capital should be reduced by 80% and losing its shares accordingly.
The study of Paris History on the morning Meeting on the historic morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic return in the week after the Senate re-established the Paulson Banking Plan. The Dow Jones index was 6.98% (which was never seen, there were about 800 points reduction), and Nasdaq was 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) contains 777.68 points, thus closing 10,365.45 points.
The largest return (684.81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001 when the trade was resumed following the September 11 terrorist attack.
Nasdaq 199.61 points were closed at 1 983,73 points, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index was 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) at 1 106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street trash has already been weakened when it opened, and when the Senate suddenly reopened the bank plan to restore the market balance, it started to reopen.
In contrast to 228 "no" votes, 205 "yes" were returned to the resources requested by the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson.
The plan was signed by two-thirds of the Republicans.
"The market has fallen out of this because Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, a FTN Financial analyser.
"It also appears how much the market has been counted on this plan," he added, and then expressed concern about the fact that if a plan would be adopted a few days later, it would be "too late."
"If the plan is really dead (...), then Fed (the US Central Bank) and the other central banks will be on the line to deal with the crisis, and the credit conditions will continue to improve," said Brian Bethune, director of the Global Insight.
The sense of urgency continues to increase, Paegza adds: "Every day, every new and new financial institution goes into your chest" in the United States.
After Washington Mutual's fifth seal, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's bank business was purchased by a rival, the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis quickly arose, which required emergency measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, in the states of Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market "is not just an American but a world-wide crisis" - adds the FTN Financial Survey.
The chain market has been significantly damaged.
On Friday evening, the 10-year-old rate of State aid decreased from 3,827% to 3,632%, and the 30-year-olds returned from 4,357% from 4,161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television pair
The two American presidential Friday, his first discussion, followed a new one, who had to pretend to be John McCain or Barack Obama as a winner of the party.
Not surprisingly, the representatives of the Republican and democratic campaign told each other of the victory in the television parades, which the American households were watching for the third time.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's action was worthy of respect, he did not prove sufficient "dependant" to establish the decline in popularity: this is evidence of five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, democracy has been better identified in the fight: Obama's public results on Saturday are positive against McCaininel (44% or 49%).
According to the most determined, 39% of the respondents will win, while 25% of McCain's winners will be counted according to an analysis prepared by the CBS.
Obama is expected to increase the benefit of his partner, Joseph Biden, who is promising great success. He is preparing for his first and only public debate, Sarah Palinne.
However, Bill Clinton warned at the end of the week: "It would be foolish to underestimate Palin.
They've got a good feeling."
McCain, who lives in the last few weeks, never hesitates to put his own, undisputed foreign political experience before him. However, he is stressing the "birth" of these issues which were among our first personal visitors.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." - he heard the attack several times.
"I don't think that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the president's position," McCain said.
This is the main attack surface, which has been used by Republican television broadcasts since yesterday.
But Obama made the noise that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be disturbed: he was completely and precisely dressed.
He stressed the ability to make good decisions and to replace the image created by the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama has already come back last week, a democratic statement that tells the Republican leader that he has not yet measured the impact of the crisis on the US "out- people".
"In the nine-minute debate, John McCainek had a lot of speculations about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday before a hundred men gathered in the cold rain in North Carolina for the election meeting.
He did not even miss the words "intermediate" or "workers" in his mouth. In the financial world, he certainly liked Obama, who the Americans are the most useful to save the economy that is at stake.
"The next week may prove a turning point," said Charles Schumer, the influential democratic senator yesterday.
Ram Emanuel, a representative of democracy, is one of the presidents of the Clinton government, who has Obama "with excellent incentives in the field of economy" as Bill Clinton was during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the democratic president, the current crisis is "the final judgment of the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Italian Senator reiterated that despite the taxable costs, it would be possible to reduce the tax burden on the US by 95%, adding that the creation of the country's potential energy dependence through the use of renewable energy resources and the development of a health insurance system is among its primary objectives.
McCain, however, plans to create 45 atomic machines up to 2030.
However, both presidents were careful about the issues related to a bank plan of $700 billion (EUR 470 billion), which was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk, "Did you notice that the election was in progress?"
Boys and opponents were shot on Friday night at the capital of the White House to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening after the vote, hundreds of white people gathered in the capital of Minsk to protest against the loss of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, a number of young President Alexandr Lukasenko has met with the following words: "Mr. Diktátor, tell me!".
Some people say they haven't gone to vote yet, "What would I have done? So they do with my vote what they want!" - a young man says.
The observers do not believe that the race, which has been set up in a good way before foreign observers for the purpose of establishing a European Union, would be a democratic system.
If the elections were to be cleared by the observers, the country could be subject to sanctions that have been imposed by 40 White Leaders, and some bank accounts have been excavated.
According to the opposition, however, the options were not clear.
"We were held by electoral committees, and our observers could not participate in the polling," complained Jury Potyemkin, who was organized by the twelve parties, so heterogeneously United Democratic Forces Coalition.
"The changes were only nominal," said Aleksandr Milinkievic, the 2006 presidential election protest and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who calculates the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the opposition has entered Parliament, it means they have been appointed, and they have not been elected.
But their entry into Parliament makes it possible for them to get a place on television, sit in the regions of the country and submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take a step in political life, because "you must start a dialogue with the European Union".
Similarly, if we are faced with a serious economic crisis in Russia and we are not able to renew it, we are at risk of being under the authority of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition calls for the European Security and Cooperation Service to take account of the election process to adopt the result of the vote.
It is stressed that the participation rate seems too high and that the organisation of the previous vote (as part of the 26% vote in Minsk) has allowed for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that the elections were held here?" - asks the question of the leader of social democracy, Aleksandr Kozulin, who was finally released from prison in August this year as a second time.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition representatives in Parliament, even those who are most in line with the leadership.
In October, the night falls again.
On television, the President of Lukasenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee will succeed.
The blood is safe again
The 10th anniversary of Hema-Québec's celebration last night. Dr. Francine Décary's president was welcome to the event because Hema-Québec has already become one of the most secure and most accessible blood-bloody companies in the world.
And most importantly, it has been successful to restore confidence in humans, which has significantly increased the impact of the blood-related bottlenecks in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood tests conducted by the Canadian Red Cross have been carried out in the 1980s with the acquired immunogenic syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C virus.
After the drama and the general investigation, the Government of Canada launched a formal investigation under the direction of Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, with the aim of determining the light on what circumstances led to the tragedy and preparing proposals for the prevention of similar cases in the future.
While submitting a report by Judge Krever, a number of content formed a committee to plan a new import system for Canada.
In Québec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
Two blood-testing services have been created in Canada by Gélineau and Krever reports: one of the Hema-Québec serving Québec, and the other is the Canadian Bloody Society responsible for the supply of all other products and two territories.
"When Hema-Québec began its activities in 1998, people already had almost 38% confidence in Québec's bleeding system," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was doubtful.
"In the coming years, however, the improvement of the safety of blood products and the results of our work in the area would have been successful in restoring people's confidence." Décary proudly notes that by early 2008, the Quebecese population already had almost 94% trust in Hema-Quebece.
Dr. Décary, however, does not forget that "trust is a very rich thing."
The precautionary principle has been applied since the establishment of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998.
A number of cases have been reported in Europe during this period when the young man, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob, also infected people with a new variety of diseases, is the doctor who has been leading the company since the establishment of 1998.
"We didn't know if this disease was spread through blood.
Therefore, the Krever and Gélineau reports are one of the most important recommendations. It is said that if we are aware of this evidence and are at risk of serious illness, we need to take only measures. In this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob was a disease that causes the brain to change so that it is impossible to die.
Thus, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And for a few years, they have only established that you spread the disease through blood.
This case has convinced us that it was reasonable to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, the market showed a technique that makes HIV-virus more sensitive to diagnosis. It is a nuclear test (NAT), which is directly capable of presenting the virus in the blood of the blood of the blood donors, and not the anti-virus anti-virus antibodies that were used in the past.
With the help of the NAT test, we have been able to shorten the period of abstinence that lasts until the virus can be shown in the blood - explains the expert.
They were able to reduce this period of time to a shorter period of time than a week.
It was thus significantly measured the risk of blood transfusions being infected outside the bloodstream and that this could not be demonstrated.
These developments significantly reduced the risk of spread through the spread of AIDS.
In our day, it's a risk that someone infected with HIV gets blood, 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should take 12 million blood products while someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products every year, it should be allowed for more than 24 years to result in such an event and someone will be infected with HIV through a blood transfusion.
I think that anyone can take it calmly today or write a blood transfusion to restore health - the first number leader of Hema-Québec.
"The challenge of your next decade will be to maintain the credibility of our products.
We'll never know what a new nurse is going into the system.
It was only last year that Réunion was diagnosed with chikungunya virus, which is similar to the Nyugat-Nius virus.
That is why we need to be part of it all the time," continued Dr. Décary, and then stressed that he should take care of the permanent contents of Hema-Quebec in addition to the precautions.
"With the age of the people, the needs are also growing.
As cancer - free treatment has become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
The population's age is also affected by the blood pressure, as the number of people involved in blood on the network is only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years of age, may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
Reporters do not accept the blood average of 14% because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been living in a country where malaria is destroyed have not been allowed to bleed for a year.
"With this 3 percent we have enough to satisfy the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare for us to get away from the preparations.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the elderly are older because they can no longer donate blood after a while.
But it's hard to convince people that they're giving blood, but it's even harder to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
In this troubled world today, it is easy for people to go without blood" - shames Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec, a $297 million annual budget, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart transplants, constipation and skin cancer, which are used only in people who are severely affected.
They analyze these texts, convert and paste them, and then place them in Hema-Quebec, which also handles one public database of Quebec.
Your skin is treated as a medical waste, which can be treated with blood that is rich in your kidneys, thus allowing you to treat serious diseases (e.g. leukaemia).
"We celebrated a few weeks ago that our bank had entered the second deposit box, and this year we planned to write more than a thousand new models.
At the beginning of the next year, we are probably starting to accept these organisations" - exactly Dr. Décary, who says today is very popular.
"My mother is sad that there is no way to do this" - in fact, this is because hema-Québec is not able to make this complex and cost-effective program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Respiratory - front of the Impact
The Montreal Impact team agreed at 3:1 yesterday at Seattle Soundrst on the USL-1 manufacturer and entered the premier with the total of 4:3. This was the fourth-handing and crucial argument in relation to the components that took place at the Saputo Stadium.
The decision-makers, Antonio Ribeiro, received a central entrance at 90 minutes of the contest.
As soon as the first half was gone, the second half was found in the enemy network of David Testo and Rocco Plantentino.
The Sounders team only succeeded in defeating Roger Levesque from Matt Jordan.
Recall that on the first Friday match, the impact of 2:1 was suffered in the town of Starfire Complex in the town of Seattle.
The Impact is playing with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which first graduated from Whitecaps at 3:1, won at 4:3 but still won the Whitecaps with a total score of 5:4.
The Impact can be seen on Friday and Sunday with Whitecapss, but the details of the disputes are still being clarified today.
In Dióhej - Kovalev winning goal
The Canadian favorite triad is waiting for the new season.
Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn took three major attacks and finally won the Canadians against Florida Panthers on 3:2 yesterday at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first number of stars in the meeting was bought by a guy. Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the contest with a total of one of the six teams that was my fourth victory.
The contest was decided by Kovalev, who received the only floor of the contest.
"I'm not ready" warning the Russian player.
"Take another game to make me really feel."
"He tried too much to get you out of the first three," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy for the final outcome of the game.
He's got a great ovulation."
Charest's north wing
The governor doesn't shut down the election this year
At the end of the Liberian party, Jean Charest had already been traveling to the Québeci Jean-Talon, where the new Health Minister, Yves Bolduc (lower) took the lead in the current interim election.
"Suppose the last major North Borders": Jean Charest set this ambitious long-term goal at the Čebeci Liberális Part Lévis meeting last week. The talk was also enriched with visual elements, while the president agreed to concentrate on the matter.
During his presentation, the background of the "Moulin au images" was painted.
Three amazing recordings were followed by: watercraft gears, heavy equipment, Québec on Google Maps, maps...
Such visible instruments were commonly introduced during election periods.
The Head of Government, in other words, was not willing to guarantee that the election will not begin this year, even if the timing was very serious.
The "new plan" for the fourth pillar is a vision of the future of Governor Québec, which is based on a "new economic area" which is linked to a French-language labour force agreement, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and more, an agreement with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening of the North (that is, the Northern Area starting at the 49th century) has often been in government speaking, but the presentation has not yet been made on this subject.
However, the Head of State simply explained why he also holds East "a full of great opportunities". However, he did not talk about timekeepers, investment sums, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
It has only increased some development opportunities: firstly, the water industry, forestry and especially the damage that continues to sustain the growth of the developing countries and the restructuring of public infrastructures.
And you can find "snakes, cinks, grass, platinum, gold, iron, iron, wax, titanium and even gums" - she ran Charest.
This is the territory that "twice as France" "our territory, Québec territory.
Not only do we have but we can find it" - the Head of State repeated, stressing that this would create a national-based myth.
He noted that Québec's development has greatly defined the relationship between North and North: the golden eagle in Abitibi, our Quebec planner, James's sister...
"This is ours, our future!" - he added, after having had a cinematic episode, he saw a huge map behind the back.
In the 70% region of Quebec, North America is also taking part in Labrador, which has always been followed by Québec - the head of government announced in the press.
"This is our historic position, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a limit, which has not been agreed for a long time, and if I sometimes pay it, I reaffirm the same position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "in view of climate change, we need to rethink our views on the North" - a statement by the Head of Government on the northern transition that opens every year following the reading of the Sri Lankan ice.
According to the Head of Government, in this new geopolitical environment, taking over the area is an important responsibility.
And what about the land's hives, Indians and equipment?
The Head of Government announced that the Government of Quebec would pay particular attention to them, and many will benefit from the plan, especially for young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was sent by the Québecois Party) have already begun the agreement with about three local communities.
It also began its operation by the Ministerial Committee of Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role.
The head of government does not close the possibility of a major meeting, "unconditionally exciting" where they create a common water.
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan has been agreed, has been adopted and will be environmentalally" - the Head of Government has promised.
Jean Charest wrote this "viso" in line with the views of the former liberal Prime Minister.
"Like the liberals of the past, we think otherwise: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges."
This was, in other words, one of the recurring topics of the weekend that began with the great party of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election.
One of the decisions taken suggests that Beauharnois be passed through the Adelard-Godbout force.
"We have political partners, including the Godbout based on Hydro-Québece, the Lesage of the National Distribution of Watercrafts, or the Bouursa, known as the father of James, knew all about how the future had to come to an end," said Jean Charest.
Another true, conservative work was introduced to the media, and the program was called "Roads to the North" by the Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, 1957 and 1963.
In connection with the plans of the Eastmain1a-Ruper Water Force, Mr Charest stated that it is planning to take place in 2012.
"It's between us, but I'm planning to be there," she said her phone calls, and she accepted her statement with a loud voice.
The Prime Minister, who also said in April that there will be no elections in 2008 and probably no elections in 2009, did not shut down the possibility of a vote that would last a year, which would also make the law possible.
However, he stressed that the agenda is now full, since he held duties at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at Québec-New York.
The meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President for the development of nationalist decisions which were adopted without any consideration. Here, in particular, it follows the recognition by the Liberal Party of "Quebec's own character" in the Constitution.
I would also like to refer to Québec as members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have the right to vote in relation to the decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, took into account the main points of the North Plan.
The leader of the Party Québecois, Paulina Marois, re-elected the development policy of the north-west Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in force in 2003 reiterated its application of this policy.
If it hadn't been done, "we've already held much earlier" - she said in agreement with Mrs Marois Françoise Mercure, who was introduced by the vote of Jean-Talon, who holds today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the North Plan.
"But we would like it if it wasn't an empty color," noted Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letter - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, Minister of Harper's Office (also the Minister of Justice) took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada a "student".
This is how to treat a woman who has fought for the truth and deserves all our wonders - so much for the people around the Prime Minister and for himself Stephen Harper.
This is why our government, which has not sent its own nationals home from the Guantánamo concentration camp to one of the countries concerned.
This is the government that is absolutely unaware of the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of committing his crimes.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, has rejected the word and has allowed a child to grow into an unaccompanied child.
The only government that is doing Christmas church for justice while investigating a convicted crime.
Let's just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian Lawyers' Association also demand Omar Khadr's return in order to participate in a decent process in Canada.
And our eyes are so dazzled by torture: he doesn't think that a young adult has already been completely ruined, and the many years of torture has probably ruined his fate in a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, now our rights, freedom and democracy are being destroyed. "Democraticism": Harper certainly hears this word, which from his mouth sounded empty.
The time has come when there is no more crime: they can be bullied, threatened, and framed by any Canadian government leader, who has been in his early childhood (and what can come after October 14th?)?
Many choose to find happiness at a party that celebrates the Lord’s Evening Meal and the Lord’s Evening Meal. They do not see this government’s leg forms the values that our country can have due to the good news and dignity.
Dear Toews, you'd rather not look for this.
View - The Barrick Gold Orwelli Hotel
On 17 September, a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President of Canada, Barrick Gold.
According to Orwelli's headline, Garver claims that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched a six million-dollar production unit against three contractors and a small-scale spending company for a so-called "public dispute".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decisions, especially in the areas of oppression, are not true, but are brought under the law.
It's not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Is Barrick Gold really the best way of public debate to destroy anyone who's against his position?
Regardless of the issue, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts to protect and combat in an uneven war, where on the other hand there is a lot of lawyers who have been supported by unexplored resources at the level of cash.
In such an unequal fight, often the tactic is used to destroy the subversive and friendly alliances that not only listen to the opponents but also fear those who try to renegotiate the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he would have had to open his eyes before the audience.
It may be good in a number of other countries where Barrick Gold continues to work, this happens differently, not usually in Canada, but in Canada, where the parties are talking about each other.
It would have been enough to open books and doses and prepare for the real debate in a press, media, and publications, paying for independent research groups that could shed light on the question.
But it seems that the Barrick Gold does not trust the address, and with a motion, he wrote questions and letters in defense of Noir Canada's authors.
Mr. Garver might explain how he could start a "public" debate if he was at the same time taking this public opinion into account?
In the head of the presidential board, this term probably refers only to the defences paid by the bus, but not to Canada's cohesion: the report of the arrest is so well received.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech is also restricted to others.
But Barrick Gold doesn't mean - or doesn't want to understand - that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are primarily supporting the public because it explains the harsh treatment of the damage.
The public opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of this civilized opinion, it would not be for a lot of people to listen more closely. (In addition to the expression "public debate" in a recent letter, the Noir Canada authors said that they should refrain from using this term.)
Garver's sudden headlights are an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for justice, which is the foundation of all democratic societies.
Throughout the procedure, it recognises the right to raise credible resources, something about the facts and their interpretations, which constitute the basis of spiritual activities.
If a country similar to Canada can only study and discuss subjects that do not like the world's economy today, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, he could do this according to scientific standards applied by Noir Canada's authors.
You have the right to answer.
In our university environment, we have been able to deal with issues, differences and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's unintended procedure shows us that nothing likes to continue a debate against his stand.
This loss means the world of universities and the public debate institution of Canada. It is time for governments to take measures that limit the legal procedures initiated with such a return.
Wall Street Rescue - Democratics and Republicans Joined
The Government of Bush and Congress leaders of the Republican and Democratic Day have reached agreement on the economic recovery, which has been the largest plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The US $700 billion plan, which aims to raise the financial crisis that has been on the Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved for the two Houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan: more effective monitoring of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the return of state funds; new provisions for maintaining the level of the house occupied by the balance of payments; and the right to pay the managers of the companies involved in the aid.
Henry Paulson, American Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, president of the U.S. House of Representatives and Judd Gregg, who participated in the negotiations, reported the good news a few minutes before the end of the two-day marathon negotiations.
"We have made great progress on a solution that will work effectively on the markets," reported Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush government.
"We have made every effort to save the real economy and American citizens from the current Wall Street crisis," the democratic representative explained.
"The most important thing is that if we don't do this, it will be terrible for the lot, chaos and violence in the lives of the Americans every day," said Republican representative Judd Gregg.
The negotiations have been intensified in the last few hours, fearing that a new failure would have a harmful effect on investors' voice.
The agreement has been extended until the dawn of this morning.
Two presidents who were later involved in the negotiations showed readiness to agree, however, were not pleased that the situation was finally improved.
Senator Barack Obama offered you an extension of the agreement to such matters as the maintenance of your home or the payment of the directors of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the lack of responsibility of other people, it is not too exciting.
But these steps are necessary," he noted in an American television artist.
And when John McCaint was against, he asked another senator if he would vote for the proposed plan, he answered, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I've read in great terms, it's already apparent that there's something that we all need to learn, and that we can continue to go through.
The opportunity to do nothing, simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy from money the double requirements of the U.S. monetary institutions, which were considered to be a risk, non-expendable assets.
The plan has been faced with a 14-month drive crisis, which has led to the accumulation of hazardous properties (conformity marks) and has led to other credit-tested (commercial) securities, and ultimately to the collapse of liquid resources and to the release of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican representatives of the first agreement signed last week.
It seems that we have succeeded in avoiding this ban since the Democrats agreed that certain "flying" assets of companies in a difficult situation would be more likely to provide the government with more than they would buy.
In order to ensure that all members of the Congress are satisfied, there is also a provision in the plan which provides that if the government has to carry losses within the framework of the programme for five years, it may take new taxes in order to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion would be paid for firstly; this would require another 100 billion if the president was required.
The remaining $350 billion should be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
In the case of aid, Washington receives participation in supported companies through which the profit is shared and which can be sold after the crisis has been resolved.
The federal government will be able to prepare for the closure of the property of the owners serving under the flagships concerned in the plan. It can also limit the maximum value for the management of companies affected by the crisis.
I would like the plan to be prepared if the plan was to be concluded today by the representative's office and on Sunday by the senator.
Despite their efforts, however, they are still not sure that the plan will be approved.
On the same day, statements against the plan were reconnaissanced by both the Republicans and the Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington does not hear your voice," said the president of the Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the House's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one who likes tax collectors."
Brad Sherman, the "skeptic groups" of a small congressional group, shows things in a different way, but it also comes to the conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize Scholars, wrote to us to ask for Congress: don't fail, and examine thoroughly which path you choose" Sherman said yesterday.
In Europe at the same time, it was once again understood that there is a global crisis.
Following a crisis assessment, the three Benelux states reported that 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion United States dollars) are part of the Fortis banking group.
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary after France's BNP Paribas signed, did not purchase the competition on the market after the United States had lost EUR 2 million ($2.9 billion) due to the crisis in the United States.
With Fortis 85 000 users, the meat is one of the largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"This isn't money spent," said Mr. Wooter Bos Dutch Minister of Finance yesterday.
"We have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly the thing that is now highly appreciated by the inmates and the housekeepers, that the situation is going to be unconfirmed."
In the middle of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to form a new bank that is subject to the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would exchange the total amount of loans in the Bradford and Bringley Bank process, from which property deposits would generate 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion US dollars).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they would buy the British bank's subsidiaries and clients.
The Bradford and Bringley with this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British government has wanted to issue since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Welcome to the film service
The most beautiful blue eyes in the world, some say, were the largest of them, others say they were the weakest.
Did you ever get rid of the naked look of the lovely American movie?
Yeah, and not.
Through shame, sensitivity, and creativity, he stood far away from the narrow style, which is the existence of the true great monsters of art.
But what a great fight he's got!
Paul Newman, 83 years old, died in a cavern and died on Friday in a connective building. He was one of the last icons of the American music flower.
There was less monumental unity than Brando, who was compared to, and who had long been counted as a street vendor. In his roles, he was more likely to be arguably injured, but he also refused to break the freedom and the drama conventions.
Children are often born with extraordinarily high blood pressure.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a mother of a Jewish father and Hungarian origin.
Europeans have contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much of you, he just increased his interests.
In the early 1950s, Yale was a member of the Yale University, and he studied at the Actor's Studio in New York before becoming a member of the film, television, and not much later in the music world.
In addition to the living conditions of civil rights, in 1979 the second place in Le Mans was a 24-hour drive. However, it was held as an ex-symbolism, possibly with Joanne Woodward, who lived in a happy marriage since 1958.
Now we can never know how valuable this secret, sealed, life of filmed life for his work, who hated the show-business star. It's still hidden for all of us.
He was a real man, in the greatest sense of the word.
At the end of the week, Paul Newman killed a lot of actors: we can only see them on the black screen in large roles.
We spent more than five years on the seventh American art, with constant changes in music.
It reminds us of the beautiful Cowboy (1969) and the young man who was relieved of his emotional wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who was seen in the "Tennesse Williams in the "Macsca in the spring" in 1958.
From the last time (1990) we can recall Mr. Bridge's feelings in the picture, which for a long time has not changed his marriage's expectations.
In addition, Paul Newman saw a lot of other faces in his movies.
In a film called "Valaki out front" by Robert Wise, the living criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano. This was introduced in 1956 by James Dean - who was transferred to Newman's career after his death.
He also played a sympathic criminal in a British act called "The Great White", which was won by Oscart in 1973 for the best film.
Robert Rossen in his zenial film "The Swindler" (1961) produced a two-time, booming billionaire, and in a similar way he returned to Martin Scorese in his film called "The Money Color". He received one of Oscar's nine prizes in 1987 for his latest design.
Changeable times, but always the same face: it was him.
It was always like that.
The change in the time of his release marked a change in seasons.
Young people are especially familiar with the cultural film George Roy Hill, "Foots" (1977), where Reggie Dunlopot, makes a team of trainers who are not too ordinary.
The region, registered by the Coen boys, was seen in the Great War, however, in 1994.
The sort Sam Mendes closed a movie called "The Path of Evil" in 2003: it appeared recently as a written mafia president.
In contrast with many musicians who had recently left the film shop, Newman had spent a long time in a reflection film, he could well have told Hollywood about it with his starring, lighting and imagery.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, did not consider all humour to be "the living football": he thought his game was too strong.
However, his career was not always with good Paul Newman, who for a long time had just been involved in filming.
Even more rare and successful characters have been played: more likely to be brought back to life by the society’s ancestors — the disease, the alcoholic, the abuse, or the loss of hope.
As an organizer, Newman showed a little more familiar face: a truly compassionate and sensitive person in his mind.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adapted by Margaret Laurence's Canadian novel), Joanne Woodward founded a beautiful portrait of a melancholy woman.
The 1984 film "Harry and Son", which stimulates rehabilitation and depression, reminds Scott of his son, who lost his son in a drug addiction.
Last night, Newman remembered about the artist. His close friend and former warrior, Robert Redford (who played with "The Big White" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boys) said: "The present has made my life and the world better.
Greatness and joy: this was the secret of this great coloring unit that we've lost now.
In addition to his career, he is pleased with his remarks about civil rights, the environment, the fight against independent film production and his remarks on Hollywood's small-scale films.
Many times we saw the picture mollusks, words, cookies, and other food packaging. It was very bad with mouth, even though it was still funny at first.
However, the entry from such sales has always been followed by a foundation for children who suffer from the disease.
Newman never sat on the babies: he was always committed to his business.
In his letter to five daughters, he wrote the following words: "My father was always, and in all likelihood, thankful for the success of the marriage.
It was great for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to be able to complete such a brilliant and great American artistry.
He was a spy, everyone.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai account?
Soon, on 8 October, the ongoing criminal proceedings against Zuschlag János and his companions will begin.
Politicians and others are particularly accused of the ongoing and commercially committed marriages and other crimes - including ill-treatment - of particular significant harm.
According to the prosecutor, the proposed funds were used for their own purposes and were often verified by false accounts.
In total, about 65 million Forints were sold to the Father’s Watch Tower, and some were sold into prison.
The method of the investigation was also known by the Authority that the proposed funds were taken up on the basis of accounts that were no longer real performance, and the companies had never made enough of the company's obligations.
According to the claim, most of the accounts were fake.
For these, accounts were obtained on the good city market, and environmentalists were manufactured in Littleton.
And what companies are doing in the name of the accountant, many of them in the Balaton area that Zuschlag János sent to Lados István.
According to his last testimony, he had to look at panties and restaurants.
The Italian consumers were asked to account for their consumption, which was then modelled on the accounts submitted to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour sector and the Government of the State.
In most of these cases, Lados István, with Žóri András, who, according to our information, wrote the accounts necessary for the recovery of the aid.
Lados was one of the little sights of his "learning path."
According to two accounts issued by Zuschlazek, in 2003, the guest place provided food for nine main groups of the Secure Point Unit.
However, according to the company's position, they would not have entered the guest's place at once.
The same is true of the Jobb for the Future - later called the Joint for the Third Year - the number of formal and content errors set out in 2002 in the framework of the Foundation.
There were only three rooms in the same pool, ten people couldn't sleep one night, the account told us about the guests of the same village.
But above all, you are the fantasizing printers when they identified the Pigal Ltd., which in their book - according to information given to the buyer - did not include documents for the Better Future and the Hoppa blood.
The director of the company, Farkas Gührer, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the trial and reported to him, he knew very well that it was false documents.
"Our company's name and tax number are wrong in the neighborhood."
He added: For formal reasons, it is not too late that hundreds of people have been accommodated, just like all ten rooms that have no room for such a man.
In fact, it's also called for the feeding of the account, while our restaurant's not working long ago.
The budgetary auditors did not follow the fact that their official Budapest travel agency only organises foreign routes, thus identifying Hungary as a service in the cash account, which was not compatible with the company's accounting practice.
In fact, as in the course of the investigation, the cost was also included in the documents, both of which were the scope of the travel activities for countries outside the European Union.
Among other things, the price was charged by the Hotel Rövfülöp Ltd. in four documents set out for Jobb for the Future, the same company service was not the mentioned 25 but 15 percent price, and the hotel used only computer accounts, but the registered account was handy.
In addition, the account was broken by the "requirers" that in the case of a company they identified road transport as an activity - said through the prosecution procedure - that the company did not continue to pursue investment advice.
In addition, differences in oil prices - not appropriate accounting format, not real heating - were due to the fact that the Union was a liar to the Foundation for the Third Century, the XXI. The National Cultural Union and the Secure Point accounts.
Whether in Ravenna Bt or in the Confederal Sports Club, whose representatives refused to have their accounts issued.
They did not notice, for example, that during the calculation of the HIB Kft. in the press church, he was in the period (2001) when he had eaten the Joint Group for Sonal Város, and that is why the company's accounting insurance - according to our knowledge - denied that he had set out the paper.
It was clearly established
The other group of accounting providers are those who were clean by having to issue a fixed account.
The Foundation for Esély Budapest has set out an account for the request of young socialists for the United Nations Foundation for the Third Year, as well as four million forums.
The leader of Collab Kft, according to the accusation, was one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic took it to issue a fixed account.
At the same time, Zuschlagen worked with the existing Biogate Ltd., which in 2003 was based on the Best Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Cross Association, with a total of five million forts that were not after real economic activity.
No payment, because the accounts have been reimbursed, but these organisations have already forgotten to include in their documents.
The accounts are included in the following group of companies that may be bound to the accused.
Thus, the business-related department of Budapest, although it is not available, was entrusted by the agent of Delta Trió Kft., who was Kubatov Ivan.
The company also issued several accounts for the sale of technical instruments in October, November and December 2005 at around 18 million Fort.
According to the investigation data, these accounts were purchased by the small-scale Cash Investment Ltd as from 14 September 2005.
This company's manager was a Romanian man who would have forwarded letters to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that the account was written for Atlas, Hoppa and the Union for the Third Year, and he took up their objections.
At the request of Kubatov Iván, a Roman war machine was set up for Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd and Jos-Investment Ltd.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which, according to the accused, was the reason they didn't get a job.
The company was still benefiting from the fact that the accused court, who also produced the documents of the companies, had established accounts for relatives related to Zuschlag: Atlass and Y-Generations, on behalf of the companies.
The Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade totaled 15 accounts for Kubatov, at a value of 14.2 million.
The prosecutor considered that 10 percent of the amounts shown in the accounts and that the tax had been sold by Kubatov.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to produce fixed accounts, these were produced for the request of the Secure Point.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association offered to the socialist party's public service organisation, the TMA.
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not translated for the purposes set out in the tender.
To prevent this from happening, five fixed accounts from the Works Team Ltd. were provided to the TMA.
These accounts were found elsewhere in the household of Kemecsey Árpád at the educational center.
In the proceedings, the defendants, as he did in the case case, are likely to be informed of the accounting procedure.
Interestingly, if you were the first defendant, Zuschlag Janos decided to improve the subject.
Eddig's testimony is not as detailed as it is, and although he promised to speak to everyone over and over again, he hasn't done it yet.
The question is whether it is for this purpose, after much of the damage, five million dollars have been committed to socialists, and Zusi is taking the left.
Those who have already been affected, as they will be able to cope with the conditions, that is, ongoing requests for shelter in the home have been found.
While there is much more harm and non-permanent economic crime, they may be free to travel or at least in their own home to wait for the end of the procedure against them, which they do not have the opportunity to do so.
Psychiatricism: Why do we give more money?
In sales, buyers tend to spend more money, overestimate the price.
This known - and apparently irrational - neurological-economic basis of behavior has been successfully identified by the New York Society's neurologists and public administration.
According to their studies in the journal Science, people don't want to stay in a race like eBay's price, so they pay too much price.
The research has tried to create a series of "study" systems with the help of pilot auctions.
One group of volunteers has been stolen, the other group has participated in the sale of toys, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) has examined the active areas of the pilots.
In both games, participants could win money, but during their auctions - which is an essential element of the over-exultation of the other party - the striatum, which is a complex complex in intensive action when the game is lost.
This area plays a role in several other functions in the "self-sufficient" mechanism.
Therefore, researchers say that the price increase can be explained by avoiding the weekly reaction of striatum.
To support their view, the members of the research group also carried out a financial follow-up investigation.
In these three groups, a partner was licensed under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned, and they did their duties.
Another group was also promised that if they won the game, they would earn another $15.
The third group, however, received $15 just before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was just enough for one of them to lose weight, for the muscles.
However, according to the hypotheses of neurologists, the members of the "resistance" team were also more prominent than the control group and the "girl" group.
"These results cannot be ruled out by the idea of an earlier economy.
At the same time, only with the joy of winning and risking, they explained the characteristics of the sale.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now reached a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Department of Public Administration of the New York Society.
Hepatitis: When do we get back to the doctor?
About half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection in the world, and chronic liver disease is mentioned among leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of patients with asethoni hepatitis may be 100, but only weeks of treatment are required: patients do not often know that they have been infected.
The name of the host of infectious diseases caused by different viruses is called hepatitis.
In their brains there are many similarities, characterized by liver transplantation and cancer, but patients and the diseases caused differ.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the carocosis: hepatitis A and E (e.g. contaminated with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus blood and body vessels (vomiting, vomiting, tongue).
Travellers must be protected with a valuable solution against A and B virus, there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis The symptoms occur two-and-a-half weeks after the intake of infected food, usually in poor moods, weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue.
After these, the skin and the eye whiteness, the skin become a clear, dark color of the water, the treatment may last for two or three weeks.
A year ago, millions of people died worldwide in the most serious type of disease, hepatitis B causes in the liver and liver.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every ten people have been infected with medicinal products.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not handled, it can lead to liver failure and liver failure.
Most infected people don't know about the disease, because the cancer drains the liver's nerves underground, in many cases only 20-30 years.
Thus it is very important to carry out the early warning, regular screenings.
In three groups, the average of these diseases is more than the same: people, drug users and tattoos who were transfused before 1991.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is currently 200 million worldwide.
Since a routine laboratory study may already show the disease, it is important to refer to your home doctor when you notice any unknown symptoms.
In time, knowing that the disease can be treated, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating infection and preventing cancer.
On 30 September, the World’s Hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by the world’s patient organisations.
It is intended to draw attention to the importance of chronic hepatic impairment, communicable events and early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God, it's less painful?
According to a recent study, the religious faith works as a healer of pain, which could even ease the death of Catholic martyrs.
The University of Oxford has completed an interesting experiment to examine how the gods influence people's experience of suffering, according to the British Telegraph.
As a result of the possible external investigation, 12 Catholic candidates and the same atheists were involved in electrosics, while all of them were studying a painting depicting a Saint Mary.
As a result, Catholics were able to eliminate much of the pain.
It was also revealed that the human brain was capable of activating the part of the brain that was responsible for controlling the pain.
The study is the first in a research series, where scientists, philosophers and theologians in addition to academics are also involved in different parts of the university.
The test was precisely designed to strengthen a scoring instrument to the left hand of the test ground that served the electrodes.
The researchers asked participants in the experiment to look at two paintings, a picture of the 17th century Sachüz Mária and Leonardo da Vinci, by Sassoferrato.
The investigators hoped that the vision of St. Mary was one of a kind of religious condition among the candidates, while the da Vinci image was chosen because they did not think too much of the other and the relaxing effect.
For half an hour the test floor was in a MRI scanner machine, during this time 20 electrons were received in four consecutive parts while you were viewing the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics were told that during the vision of St. Mary, they felt "safe" as if they had been "sustained" and "satisfied, made peace with them".
During the look of the religious theme, 12 percent of the pain was reported as less than when they saw Leonardo’s behavior before them.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who has also participated in the study, thinks that the same effect can be affected by any powerful image, even by the atheists, only to find the appropriate picture.
"We should find a picture that feels very positive about it like a mother or a father." said the psychologist.
Tom Wright's English puppies welcomed the results of the investigation.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases change our personality." He added Wright.
After the great results, only the question is, if Leonardo, or any of the similar caliber painters are showing a picture of what would be the effect on their pain control?
Would the vision of the quality Shrimp Mary mean even better results?
You're what you share about yourself.
On his tenth birthday, Google can say: people are at least as close to their heads as they are to the sun; you know where they've been vacationed to what sort of events they are going to and what they care about.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's principals.
However, what the medical mirror has to do with veneer skeptics, they do not see at all the point of the 2.0 basis of the web.
Eric Schmidt recently announced to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal information about users, and this is necessary to enable them to keep themselves for the original goal of Google developers, which he said, "Put all the information in the system!".
According to the dedicated Google guide, even after ten years of world sales, the company is still able to manage all the information at first.
To ask what it will be five years ago, Schmidt answered: "Would you like Google to answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what work do I really do?" - but the software can't answer such simple questions, because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact determination of the search engine during Internet searches to what IP address they were looking for and to what site the interested parties were looking for after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, users can, for example, eliminate their own divergent tendencies, return what they have sought for, and they will generate much better personal findings for them - on the same logic as the Recommendations, which provides us with products and services based on our previous and defined preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they see what I'm dealing with? - they ask users who are worried about Google's data monopolies.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company can be spreading, not the crime, the fear of punishment, the free will, and then the opposition on the Internet.
However, it has been confirmed that not only all requested expressions are defined, but, where appropriate, they can be passed over to a third party, in such cases the rights of Internet users are not protected.
The most recent example of this was perhaps a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information on the Community website called Orkut with regard to pedophiles.
However, Internet users concerned about personal rights could still be consulted in May when the company successfully confirmed the truth in court against the FBI: Google can no later be forced by any point of the law to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully dealt with almost five thousand websites and thousands of search terms, which have been won with reference to the strengthening of the child protection law adopted years ago, but has not yet been able to obtain the search lists of individual users or a full list of websites and keywords for two months.)
It is therefore possible to oppose Google's criticism: those who keep their personal data from giving because they feel that their intimate spheres and their own privacy are confused by the use of Google's services and are faced with the shocks that come up with by multiple companies in conservative imdjs.
At the same time, the American geek culture and its multi-generation of digital circuits, activists, users in a number of countries, as well as the next generation of large companies, is seen by the "time corporation" as a global partner for Windows, however, to fight both for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not ask for a code from users different from Microsoft, does not ask for money, the open, free, continuously updated source code and software packages are much more available, younger, cooler than the official software practice.
However, it can also be said that the geeks are experiencing exactly the attitude of personal rights and the very problem of the Internet, which is exactly one of the most commonly heard keywords in the past years, the web 2.0 is behind you.
The 2.0 web does not speak of the same thing as the collaboration, that we deliberately do research on ourselves and use the communication channels available and while each of them changes its size, the same thing: we show ourselves.
An average number of community pages can lead a profile from Facebook to Xlanga, which can also be combined with other services such as Twitter, or last.fm, which lists your music habits, and then enter all of them into follow-up systems such as FriendsFeed or Blip.fm, which can lead to a blog that automatically displays the latest photo gallerys that are stored on Flickr or Picasan.
While many of us can read about an example that makes it clear: the friend will easily find a single friend’s morning photo of his family friend who spent the night with his friend or who can shoot a company’s worker just because he writes his true opinion on the above: a sure, personal opinion has been completely overestimated.
The one who lives online is the one who shows himself, so we can build a better foundation after the behavior of today’s young people.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least wants to get the Google monopolium, he can do (for example, he uses the Google search system, but he does not deliberately leave the print with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not register on social sites for reasons not to be able to comply with them is not limited to the number of people who use Google online from the editor to users and ads, with alternative versions that do not bind to major servers and that do not form the best profile that has ever been created.
The public opinion is not so secret as to show Google the white of the fruit.
The company is currently worth $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising services threaten the entry of advertising agencies, and services that have been introduced in the fast pace are seriously focused not only on Microsoft but also on many other software developers.
However, critical viewpoints are also found to be contrary to the complainant's effect: for example, the superior management fully rejected the ban on the employees after double taxation of the company's profit, found that the company found it too costly to consume the daily food of the employees, however, in addition to the fact that Google was still operating before the Chinese government in 2006 and in the light of their agreements, all the company's findings, which violates the good pleasure and the interests of China.
One of the internal rules of the company is that no new service will be issued in advance, only when it is already available, but the problems of the coming months and years can move the world further: while some think that Google's book and magazine testing and archiving project is such that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others will be able to build a complete health profile on our own, with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good basis for the next generation of scis-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, the Scroogled point of a well-known future, in which a person can be very close to Google's data.
Two young people helped the Ozdi double killer in the persecution
Two young people were heard by the police in the case of a two-year homicide, and the suspect was helped to eliminate the prints of the crime - he said to the chief officer of the police department in Borsod.
Young people have recognized their fate and now accuse them of being guilty of crime.
Two teenage girls, MTI information, are freely protected by two girls.
Offences can also be punished with the loss of freedom of up to 5 years.
A 23-year-old local man was suspected of being arrested on Sunday.
In the past, they have been falsely accused of the crimes committed by a number of people.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-olds had a higher number of 53-year-old men.
The suspect didn't want to adjust his custody, so his client went to an osteoporosis last week, where he ended up with a nine-year-old girl.
According to the MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, which also means that he followed the murder with his gun on the scene.
The police shall examine the circumstances of the weapon and its use.
He made a proposal for Versus trash to buy trash.
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - have been proposed for the purchase of the percentage share package in the price valuation.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Versailles Valerie, confirmed the offer made by the Polish peoples that the Versailles were excavated earlier from the new properties of the porous.
It's because the Russian trash is in state hands.
The 99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to give more than 60 percent of the papers during a few months of deposit.
The E15 Czech Economic Day knows newly that the Polish offer is the highest amount that the interested parties have already offered for the fraud of the pig.
According to Czech leaves, the balance sheet, Nasdaq translating bag, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse offered.
Peter Koblic, head of the pharaoh’s evaluation last week, declared that one of the interested parties would be the worst new owner, and did not close that this could lead to the destruction of the pharaoh’s valuations in the future.
Price estimates are estimated at 5-10 billion kroner by market experts.
According to the shares agreement, about 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner in Prague is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with approximately 25 percent share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 13.5 percent.
On the face of the financial crisis in Europe
The European pages leading up to the ongoing international financial crisis are already referred to as 'the 11th of September' in their comments on the ongoing international financial crisis.
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster - on the ground that the President of Rome La Repubblica was not yet able to recover his own party after a legislative proposal that aims to remedy the situation without doubt...
Another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett, is the second of September 11th.
The Madrid press also sees the crime in Washington.
According to El Mundo's view, the lack of the Italian political leadership has led to the spread of the global economy.
A woman is at risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not so perfect, however, by means of the Congress vote, the danger of not offering political instruments to deal with the crisis is a threat to Washington.
The world economy lies in the atmosphere — right now when one of the greatest obstacles to capitalism is being overcome.
The threat can no longer be ignored - shows it to Genfi Tages-Anzeiger.
Some States can still provide pensions to pension institutions today, and taxpayers can save them from unemployment.
But if more banks are in the same way as domino-cocks, neither money nor new settlements will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to put themselves in their national ownership and focus on the control of the financial markets in the dividends.
Just a week ago, more than 100 billion euros were received from the weak financial institutions - a reminder from the Becksy Der Standard, who are increasingly concerned that European taxpayers need to be put in their pockets in order to address the crisis.
The EU has not yet been seriously involved in the crisis, which ends in the old land as a tsunami.
The "residents" should not only steal hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if I decided that it would be reasonable for taxpayers to pay for the greatest damage.
The Dong flight imitates the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies that are useful to prevent fraud if not followed by obstacles in the world of nature?
For example, your hair.
In the excellent project presented in CEATEC in Japan, the Dongs gave strategic insights to Nissan's measurement of how to build the next generation of non-requirement systems.
In cooperation with such a university, Nissan built a system of type BR23C, a robotized vehicle equipped with the properties of the stones, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that will cost all the damage.
During the flight, every month it presents its own personal area, which is actually very similar to our security guards - explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, the technological PR and research development market manager.
It is important to play a role in the self-contained person who is able to see more than 300 stars in every direction.
In order to remove its complex function, the sizes have been adjusted to the concept of the distance from existence.
It identifies obstacles within 180 metres before the BR23C, calculates the distances, and sends a signal to the surface microprocessor, which is immediately transferred to the operation to prevent the injury.
During the second half of the period, notice of the obstacle is taken, and then the carrot, following its movements, has immediately changed its direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid injury.
In any way different from the current system, this exceptional manoeuvre is completely inspired.
"If that wasn't the case, the auto robot could not react too quickly to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto robot project.
It should be responded in an orderly and immediate manner, as this technology is consistent with the most damaging and most permanent part of safety defenders, a line within which the strike is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process needs to reflect what one month does in order for others to come out.
This process should be discontinued under a glance.
But, unlike the waves, the distance cannot be guided up, down or through, only by two dimensions, and only in relation to the ability of the wheels to reversibility.
In this way, instead of the endless possibility for the mice to be able to escape the other months, only the movement and speed of the spring and the landing were used as an opportunity for the car fleet to be available.
BR23C applies lithium polymer accumulators which are easier and more energy-efficient, which means that they have lived longer than lithium change.
According to Andoh, the recommended intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, but the ability to store even less.
This structure needs to process and react to only a few inputs per second.
There is no need to protect them, and to respond to the intuitical logic based on the data of the former manoeuvres, so he continues to use only a few thousand kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for a giant, or a giant, big memory.
This is the first step towards the development of the technology for immediate exit, which can be brought into line production cars within ten years based on Nissan's assessment.
The installation of the unit with the GPS-friendly navigation system may include additional application options to lead the vehicle to the end of the given route with the exception of the obstacles.
Name has also been given to the child of the bear.
The written version is prepared for the $700 billion economic savings package law for banks to buy their bad loans in several parts.
First of all, the amount is spent.
According to the Eastern Party's time, during further agreements until Saturday night, the convention leaders came to the fore with a total of $700 billion in a round - day debate - said Reuters.
We have made some progress, reports Nancy Pelosi, president of the U.S. Democratic Republic of the Congo, who claims that the treaty has been signed.
He supported both the compromise on the package, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said of the outcome of the compromise: the programme will work and will be effective, but it will also require more stakeholders. It is a pelossian opinion that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy back.
The written change in the package was made public by the opening of the 8th Sunday evening (i.e. two weeks from mid-European summer) at the time of the Asian markets, but did not lead to a visible increase in the markets.
The draft legislation on the programme, on behalf of the 2008 Economic Stabilisation Act, on the proposal for a law, firstly on Monday, will be the vote of the House of Representatives and will be held in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and he welcomed news of the agreement in the White House.
We are pleased with the progress of the night and highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the speaker of the White House.
The programme differs differently from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have said that $700 billion would have been transferred to purchase a single quality, credit-added securities.
In the first instance, the maximum amount of 700 billion can be estimated to be spent immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the issue, from which the Ministry of Finance purchases credit-based, miscalcated securities, and another $100 billion series depends on the President's decision.
The program will be monitored by a special body, which will also be attended by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The transfer of 700 billion to the other side depends on the recent decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: it may once purchase bad credit, trademarks and trademark securities as well as other types of "serious" credit.
In the course of purchase auctions, and directly, the department's properties were announced.
The legislation makes it possible for the companies concerned to participate in a programme of insurance, where the financial business guarantees the taxable instruments due to concern, so that companies will pay the appropriate fee for the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to cover almost $700 billion for the US financial system's urgent needs, whether it's for the wide range of purchases of the bad instruments, or for their insurance, or for the avoidance of a system that is linked to a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to enter the Law as it is signed.
However, the chief bankes who are in trouble and expect State aid can count on the government to limit their retirement money - called a simple gold miner.
The limitation of payments only occurs in certain cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the Ministry buys in the auction frameworks, it will be paid to the gold miner unless it is sent to the transferred bank.
When bad beliefs are bought directly, the government will intervene aggressively in order to ensure that the leaders' money will not be lost.
The ability to ensure that the existing oil supply contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to the new ones so as to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the US case that legislation will be limited to recommending managers - the measure was commented by the president of the Committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives, party of the Democratic Party, Barney Frank.
In addition, in participating banks in the programme, the State has the right to participate in the procurement, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can eventually win the business, as the economy and with it are at stake in the saved bank.
The legislative plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress on how to recover the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, both sides were the ones who solved their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, i.e. not protecting taxpayers' dollars - said the California Republican representative Darrell Issa.
A colleague of Ohio Democrats, Mary Kaptur, said that the same measures were being taken by those responsible for the collapse of the Wall Street.
Continued Industrial Prices
In August 2008, the domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent in the previous month compared to August 2007, compared with 12.9 percent in 2007 - the rate is known to be KSH.
Export prices for industrial exports increased by 1.1 percent by July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent by one year earlier.
As a result of the changes in domestic and export prices, industrial prices were higher than 0.7 percent in the previous month and 3.2 percent in the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent in the previous month only to a minimum.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry increased by 0.1 percent to July.
The highest price increase was achieved in the leather product sector in August 2008 (2.8 percent), mainly due to the increase in the price of milk, milk and milk production by 4.6 percent, and the price of the milk production by 2.5 percent.
The higher monthly increase in the price of organic and vegetable materials resulted in the production of the textile material at the price of the product sector (1.6 percent).
Price reduction has been followed by oil processing (1.4%), the production of light machinery, machinery (0.9 percent), and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1 percent).
The price of paper production, expenditure and printing activities has not changed.
In the other processing industry, we measure price increases between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
The prices were increased by 0.3 percent in August in the coal gas, gas, gas and water sectors, which represented a significant weight in the domestic sales of the industry, mainly as a result of the transitional effects of the official gas consumption carried out from 1 July.
In comparison to 12 months, prices increased in the oil processing sector (32.4%) at the highest level.
The production of dairy products in the sector was 13.2 per cent, an 11 per cent increase in the production area of food, oil, tobacco.
Price reductions in textiles, textile production (2.5 percent) and production of light machinery and machinery (0.3 percent) have been followed in sectors.
In the other processing sector, the price increase was between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent.
In the past year, the prices rose by 10.2 percent.
The electricity, gas, gas, gas and water sectors were sold at 18.7 percent a year earlier.

Prices were increased by 0.3 percent in the consumer sectors and in the energy and further consumption sectors, prices did not change in the previous month.
As of August 2008, the highest price for the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy and demand sectors (16.8 percent).
We measure 6.8 percent increase in consumer products in sectors, 1.4 percent decrease in investment proposals.
The export prices measured in the industry increased by 1.1 percent in August in the previous month and decreased by 3.9 percent in 12 months compared with 3.9 percent.
Our home payrolls were reduced by 1.7 percent to the euro within a month, by 7.1 percent to the dollar, by 7.5 percent to the euro, by 15.9 percent to the dollar, compared with August 2007.
I don't have to look into the United States in the future?
Göncz Kinga has a good chance of entering into the U.S.-U.A. visa agreement on 12 January - the Foreign Minister in Chicago spoke before the local Hungarian leadership.
According to the opinion, "now everything is in good shape depends only on whether the electronic input system or control system is available at sea in time".
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but tourists will have to register themselves before the start.
The Hungarian Diplomatic Leader is conducting negotiations in Washington.
He meets with the Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who transmits the Hungarian Republic's Erdemrend Central Research Centre to the Barack Obama Democratic Party and President of the Republic John McCain.
There are also Barack Obama and McCain with the banking package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the president of the two large American parties, gave support to the government's $700 billion banking assistance package on Friday, but there is a political party that follows the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
It was reported at the end of Saturday after the March negotiations between Congress and the representatives of the administration: a decision was made on the banking package.
The financial package for the Wall Street crisis and the development of the enhanced credit market became the main issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain also point out that it is more useful to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, Obama has made a number of profits in advance of economic issues, re-reading McCain's benefits after the Republican Convention, with the signature of Vice-President Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed his hope on a Sunday in a detroit campaign that the Congressman would soon accept the 700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer's protective passports that he also supported.
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) your position, your savings, all industries, and the stability of the whole economy," he said before the 35-year-old crowd.
He didn't hesitate to mention McCain's economic ideas over time.
McCain explained in an interview with the ABC, "We're all going to be difficult to be... but nothing is simply impossible."
The Republican Senator announced that the proposal involved the establishment of the Minister of Finance's Supervisory Committee and the limitation of the completion of the officers, which he called for.
Obama told CBS that McCainek had no interest in the agreements, but he had a daily contact with the minister.
On Thursday, President Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the legislative proposal on Monday.
Children’s Picture of the German Language
The top-level team is not affected, only in the camp, the voters have become more aggressive - so Der Spiegel analyzes CSU's weak participation in Belarus.
Hairdressers are ready for the Austrian government to prevent red-white coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online release of the German newsmagazine in the Baltic Sea, Franz Walter, a translator from Belarus, analyzes the effects of the CSU’s dramatic blood pressure in the title of his parents.
According to the well-known politician, the CSU's heroism had begun well before the sad Beckstein-Huber had taken over his office.
During the decades of Christendom’s socialist revolution, Belarus has been restored - and now these modern citizens have become independent of them.
The turning point is the whole Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel's problem.
The fraud was not complete for the CSU, but at the end of the Sunday, a process that was precisely possible for ten years: a state-owned hegemony disappeared.
For ten years, in 1998, CSU was established by 47.7 percent, first by 50 percent in the five years.
This has been repeated for three years in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it is still in the so-called Stoiber era.
This is the result of the update carried out by the CSU in the container, which covers the parents.
Sociologists have been doing this for 40 years, but they have been very disappointed in the past. However, there are no consequences for the integrity of CSU voters in the region that is developing in Belarus.
Modernization is accompanied by increasing opportunities and the political consequences of this.
The top-level team is not affected, only in the camp, the voters have become more aggressive, critical, self-defense.
It is also apparent that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups have been more distant from the CSU; free employment, the emperors, the feelers and the supreme achievements.
The CSU's support is already under 40 percent.

The Conservative Budget Day, entitled "Who, with? The Partners on the back-up issues" deals with the difficult internal political situation following the districts' elections.
The SPO wants to talk to the OVP.
The OVP inhibits the injection of SPU in its organs.
The BZO is open to negotiations, and the Greens still don't want to agree on co-operation.
The election took place, now all the coalitions are around; in a public service television discussion, the partners were almost allowed to look into their cards.
President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to speak with the OVP.
The SPO also wants to show that it is possible to cooperate with the two parties - in certain fields and in social partnership.
The question of co-operation with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current OVP president, as well as with the Alkancellar, was that Faymann left open.
As he imagined, Schüssel-Molter's course was taken everywhere.
This direction is not a word for a change.
Multer responded carefully to the red bids.
As he said, co-operation will certainly not be successful if Faymann seeks to intervene in the brains of the OVP.
In order to respond to the opposition, or to enter into the coalition, the party has been fully open to the party, the issues must be discussed without prejudice to the OVP.
The President of Jörg Haider BZZÓ has again shown all directions.
"To prevent red-white training, we are ready for government responsibility," Haider said.
Players: You have to break the poverty, you've got to break the back of the gang.
In Paris today, France's home manager, representing the Presidency of the European Union, began.
Járóka Lívia, the European Foreign Minister for Europe, called attention to educational segregation as one of the main words of vocational advice, because this is also one of the most difficult legal and reasonable measures for Roma children.
The High-level Conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, has certainly opened up a European conference for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The Council invited governments, European social partners and representatives of European law enforcement and civil society organisations to take their place in the area of equality.
According to the press release of the Group of Officials of the European Union, the speaker warned that, in addition to the distinction between employment and employment, low education in the Roman world continues to fall first on the labour market.
"The majority of Roma young people do not have a medium-term finish, and because of poor quality basic education, they can only receive a substantial part of the upper end."
The speaker further stressed that as fundamental human rights, education plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the representative, it is necessary to inform these relationships in the broadest of Roman and non-Romania.
As in the past, the Roma students started school, so that women could become members of the labour market; they participate in national budgets paid after income and consumption.
"The European Union's citizens need to ensure the rights of quality education and to guarantee the calculation of their low level and differential education," said Járóka Lívia.
According to the representative, it is essential that the European Union's objective and action-oriented summary is essential for the immediate acceleration of school disaggregation processes and for the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must also break the evil environment of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and Roma children must be given the opportunity to become full-time citizens of Europe," Jaróka demanded.
In the European Year of Opportunity for All, the aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held in Berlin since the meeting of the Council, is to ensure a single forum for the promotion of opportunities and diversity at European and Member State level.
CSU: for the transitional period
At the end of October, they decided on the series of Duo Hober-Beckstein
Despite the noise of the cpufos elections, heads have not been injured, the poor CSU's cuts have been brought to the fore to discuss the personal issues.
President Erwin Huber and Deputy Governor Günther Beckstein can still be on the spot, asking how long the struggle lasts.
At the end of the last week of the 17th century, a special party convention will be held at the end of the seminar on the loss of the 17th century.
Many of the judges ’ parishioners felt at all: they don't have all their strengths in their pockets.
The group and the base angry members were thus forced to resign, who, one day after the "bajor cunami", were required to observe personal conventions because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, whose petition was just now under way, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now only 43.4 percent of them, after a year of beatings against Stoiber.
CSU has been "compulsory" for 46 years in the German GDP 18 percent tax in Belarus.
Conservatives continue to be highly critical to the Hungarian economy in the south-east region, and are forced to co-operation in the future.
As one of the first features of the internal competition in the Parton, President Horst Sehoofer and Federal Agriculture Minister for Human Rights is also taking a position in the field of exhibitions organised with the liberal FDP and at the best levels of freedom of movement from the free will of the electors.
The weird fan that the Free Elections list has entered into the law is Gabriele Pauli, who used Stoiber's action as a parous opportunity, and will eventually be replaced by a very concerned national politician.
The CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into a way of stabilising Beckstein.
The transition will have an active role to play on 28 September for the most difficult day of political intervention by former Head of Government and former President of the CSU.
Huber stopped several times a week to comment on the CDU, he said he would have received much more support from the brother-in-law.
Other CSU politicians have explained the fact that the warning is also for CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the election of the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel shall not be an official unless the CSU, which plays a significant role in the 2005 national success, is set off in a joint effort.
According to Merkel, the loss of CSU will not be negative for Berlin’s major training.
What is of course relative: CSU will not be easy to deal with, but the crisis of social Democrats continues.
The SPD has had more results since 1946 than 18.6 percent in Belarus.
Lukasenko resistance: 110-0
Not one opposition representative entered the White House on Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability of the country of Aleksandr Lukasenko, according to the European Security and Cooperation Service (EBESZ), however, by the illegality of the voting.
The EBESZ, sending 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the options.
Although 10 million of the country's main legislation has not been passed on for decades without opposition, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) of yesterday's elections sincerely hoped that the draft legislative amendment would update the appointment of President Lukasenko in the 2006 clean-up elections to the House by presenting a few "megenedi" protestors.
The ODSZ has also been replaced by the previously measured botch.
In the wake of the opposition's expectations, it was hoped that Belarus, which was increasingly dependent on Russia - which was convinced of the continuing import of expensive Russian gas and also contributed to the acquisition of trans-country gas pipelines - would improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukasenko and several high-level politicians were not allowed to enter because of the anti-democratic white policy arrangement.
In the first place, the EESC pointed out that when the election campaign was being evaluated, the vote was more positive than the negatives - for example, to prevent the launch of the third of the candidates.
However, the EESC's weekly report has already adopted the campaign - during which the opposition's symptoms were not actually present in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be included in the counting of votes.
In addition, the opposition suggests that there is still considerable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is still facing a smaller confrontation with Moscow, while the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is from Georgia, is still being rejected, although Russia - which has created a federal state of the Black Sea paper state - has now considered the two areas independent for a month.
- We took two steps forward, one back, but the most important thing that started the conversation between Belarus and the EU is that our website, Aleksandr Millinkevic, said.
According to the 2006 presidential election opposition, it is desirable that this remain, despite the fact that "the power to allow even one objection to the indebted parliament."
In view of the results, the opposition does not intend to challenge action, but tries to send a message on the need for economic reforms to the voters.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposing pages in Russia, see the restrictions on distribution by the local authorities, but I can see that they are increasing their support for the change, including in the age, according to Millinkevics, in spite of the fact that the Lukasenko section, which considers the most important result of creating social security, does not even hold the ranks of the most officially supported pensioners.
- The sale of the country, the rise in trade deficit, the time question of social security, Millinkevic said.
Russian observers have approved the elections democratically against the opposition politician.
Szergej Lebegyev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian Federation of Rio Novoszty, "Not the words, but the deeds of the people believe," thus the lack of resistance is no more than evidence of the existence of white voters.
Brunetta: "Just before a regular worker"
In the history of Chigi Palota alone, manufacturers were trained to extract and install workers.
From today's point of view, this new measure is being taken against businessmen, those who block and then go to buy a coffee at work.
Today's negative news was presented to the Prime Minister of Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, the Prime Minister's office.
"The sources - said Brunetta - serve better and more effective work, reduce deficits and increase services"
"New, more responsible and transparent periods follow.
This is the real reform," Brunetta stressed.
The preparation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers is completed with the Chigi Palace.
Masi says "the composition of the tunnels is also symbolic."
We did not experience opposition from the app, but he confirmed the key point: "The workers took the initiative, everyone cooperated."
So it's over in the morning work, there's no more coffee and beer.
Brunetta smiles: "A good little capuccino morning, capable of miracles"
At the University of the Roman Government
The Minister said in his advice: "In three months, 50 percent of the population's deficits have been reduced because of the disease of workers in the public sector, which means more than six months of work in one year."
It also added that the Italian administration should be more effective
, "what the minister said was two times as much in the last 8-10 years as in his private life, and he well exceeded the rate of inflation."
At the same time, a number of thousands have joined in joining the proposal supported by the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Associations Service to oppose the provisions of the Brunetta-type Regulation.
"As the Minister of Public Administration collects data to reduce the sickness deficits, the 'unforeseen days' are increasing continuously" - writes the Consumer Protection Unit.
Italy has sent thousands of qualified and hard-working public administrations together to send a message to the illegal provisions of the Regulation."
The Regional Administrative Court shall include, inter alia, an additional plan for the recovery of disease caused by the disease, an extension of the duration of the stay of workers at home in the hospital, which means the period within which the patient can be shown, and a number of other new provisions provided by the Minister.
Job accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
Every day 2,500 workplace accidents occur in Italy, 3 of which end with 3 deaths, and 27 of which end with permanent hunger.
According to the workplace accident insurance data, nearly 1,200 deaths took place in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of murder today, and almost twice as much sacrifice as humans do.
Today, Anmil conducts 58 times in all parts of Italy, the day of the victims of the work-related accidents normally held on the second day of October, to draw attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
"The tragic events of the past few days and the tragic events of Anmil, as well as the fact that workplace accidents have an important role to play in preventing them," reported the President of the Government of Giorgio Napolitano to Pietro Mercandelli in a letter sent to the President of the National Assembly of the Baltic States.
The Head of State has sincerely appreciated "the commitment of a joint partner to the prevention of work, the protection of workers suffering from accidents, the assistance of victims' families and the integrity of the public sector".
"Of course, and of course, everyone has faced a challenge that is truly marked, in terms of the media and the public interest, but we need to deal with tragedy as a day, again and again."
Napolitano frankly admits: "We are certainly fighting with resources, and financing education and information is crucial.
It is particularly important that school-in-school initiatives aimed at directly clarifying young people in the workplace.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the present, not to allow attention to the social significance of the question, and to need more effective legislation to be taken into account.
Mr. Gianfranco Fini, President of the House of Commons, stressed that "the serious social importance of occupational accidents at the end of death is the social significance of all of us, and the institutions require them to do so before it is over."
"The data on workplace accidents show little improvement, but the number of deaths of such signs is still amazingly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We don't want to do that at the same time if this lower trend is due to a decrease in attention, because the biggest tragedies will occur when the attention is paid."
"We believe that at the general level we still do not do everything to overcome the phenomenon that could be solved through a complex programme of action.
In our view, it would be necessary to monitor and monitor more closely - he stressed Mercandelli - and to engage more closely in the field of vocational training, starting with school education."
"There is a need for further efforts in order to inform the public of the opinion and its relevance" - he added.
Most importantly, however, the more responsible working environment is in the face of a social problem."
After that, Mercandelli ruled that "the increased level of protection provided by the victims of occupational accidents" and "the aid directive which is being implemented by the system in recent years".
"The aim is to give workers back the security provided by the insurance, because the number of victims of the accident does not depend on the lawmakers where they are willing and where they are divided."
MP3 audio transmission can cause loss of voice
For example, MP3 devices can be used for longer-term and high-voice hearing.
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the new and re-identified health risks Scientific Committee (SCENIHR) referred to the public opinion of today.
"It is clear from the experience that in 5-10 percent, those who have been listening to loud speakers over a period of five years may suffer from hearing loss" - read in the explanation.
"It's a shame that young people who use high-frequency and high-frequency recording players and mobile phones are not aware of the fact that they can cause irreparably harm to their ears," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific research poses an unbiased risk that we need to react urgently" - the EU added security.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information in a wide range.
In the light of that approach, we must also examine existing control systems in order to function properly and be able to take action with the latest technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of vulnerable players and the increase in the number of young people considered as a cause for disturbance.
"The researchers confirm that we are concerned, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and interested parties, is ready to examine what possible measures can be taken to protect children and young people affected by obstacles to the protection of caregivers and similar instruments," said the Member of the Commission.
The current European security requirement in 100 dB determines the volume of voice emitted by the eardrums, however, increasing concern is the data on noise pollution from over-use of such signal sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of closure, which can significantly reduce these hearing damages.
In the opinion of the Scientific Committee of the EU, it is important for users who listen to a high voice over five hours (more than 89 decibels) for five weeks to be able to overcome the current maximum value for job noise.
If someone has heard music in similar situations for a longer time, five years later the risk of remaining hearing damage will be avoided.
This can affect around 5-10 percent of users, which can also include 2.5-10 million EU leaders.
Rome, Germany appoints a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, March, the results are expected in June.
This ceremony was set up by the National Government for the operation of the committee called "the future of the capital city of Rome", which sat next to the new section after the fall of Caracala.
The following six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Committee shall draw up the Roma directives.
Following the end of March, the Council and the Committee of the Regions shall assess the study and plans to be made in June so as to give the Government and Gianni Alemanno's official strategic plan.
"This independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural thinking represents itself, stresses the responsibility of Alemanno, to work out proposals for the development of Rome, which policymakers can therefore support the Assembly and the Intergovernmental Committee.
There is no indication of any incompatibilities, we would have sent only a platform where large plans could be made to serve the purpose of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the Commission will be divided because it has a mandate for a specified time.
In June, we presented a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the city of Rome - the mayor announced.
Those responsible for the operation of the Commission, pointing out that the opinion adopted by the Commission is not binding, Alemanno answers: "All depends on what the Commission is doing and on what colourful proposals it makes on the table.
If the film is consistent, as in France as in the case of the Atali Commission, which I am sure to take in the case of Rome, there will be an important role to play in its contribution.
Political power is often involved in day-to-day affairs and in dealing with emergencies that arise from time to time.
In this respect, we also look forward to further planning and commitment to the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "the Commission does not seem to be able to look at the use of "water", since it will not be fully free to enter a euro of the Roma citizens, it will serve with consideration and aim to introduce the most important elements of the city".
According to Germanno, "there is a need for an open and flexible strategic framework that enables our city to develop the stage in which it would be so much needed to think about the future in a uniform manner."
Regarding the future, the mayor of Rome points out: "Not only will it be limited to the current state of affairs but it will be much more distant", we see not only the rest of the metropolis and the capital status, but also "the role of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean as capital, and what it needs to play".
Obama, the first U.S. opposition president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician, who claims to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second American opposition president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decided to break up the American economy and established close ties (as he does today) with the enemy Islam."
As the election date draws near, the attacks against Obama will be severe.
A woman named Miami wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama thinks it's invisibly possible to undermine a nation's highest public value, for which he has already had two governors and five senators!"
These attacks are really nothing; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the voter's question whether he will be a good president. Then there are public opinion research here: it means Obama will win, even in a significant area.
There is also one who listens to his feelings and not to his anger.
In the interior of the South States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this to the leaders: we know very well that the vote will be taken by the true American family.
The American way of thinking is marked here by a page that remained hidden until the last minute.
"Just talk what you want, and then we know where we're going to put our trust in Obama or McCain."
There are those who swear that if Obama wins, he will leave the United States.
They have never heard of such words until now when blacks can be sure of success.
At the same time, despite all precautions, the democratics will win the war against you, George Bush.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's official period? 89 percent answered that Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it was announced that it was flying home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
Most still think that Iraq was the weak point of Bush.
You're gonna have to wait for someone who's going to take George W.
USA: Economic integration is already felt by journalists, and the timing of cuts has also come in the structures. Many are based on the Internet, due to the printed media's "death".
The PEW research agency asked five hundred U.S. journalists how they feel about their future situation and spiritual power.
Well, now almost every journalist is a pessimist for his own future.
However, there was no clear indication that our concerns about honesty would be reduced.
You don't feel as upset as you used to.
The U.S. press problem is money.
We believe the 2008 crisis is a weak economic model.
Further serious concerns were expressed to the newsroom, i.e. cuts to the structure of the newspaper.
If we do not want the traditional journal, in the sense of what the great public is doing under this, at least we need to address this problem - the journalists ask.
Today's well-visible and complex pessimism is an American journal.
Six percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the press are convinced that national segregation is wrong.
At the local level, the press is at the top 65 percent leading position.
Printed against the electronic press.
The media workers don't have a hard time seeing where the world is headed.
The biggest spenders are ruining their way to the Internet, which many think is the printed media's "killer".
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has grown to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed recognized the fact that technology is making a lot of noise, hoping that it might become a success of cynicism.
Today, the U.S. press team has a role to play among structural leaders, that is, the leaders, and their working scientists.
At national level 56 percent of the leaders are sure that their researchers share their information with others, while at local level this rate is only 23 percent.
Sometimes this is connected to a certain place of work.
At the national level, 47 percent of the leaders have lost their jobs in three years.
For journalists, it's 30 percent.
In America, the question of "reliable work" is on the team (in our case, in our editors) constantly on the agenda.
Newspapers have only 13 percent of the contract.
In the case of a powerful nation like the United States of 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet servers operate, employers usually offer as much as they would like to, so that the thing "can or should not" works on the basis of it.
Directors usually receive high pay, and the editors can also look for $10 per month for the payment of pension and health insurance.
The freedom, however, works in a rather complicated manner: in the first year x day, at the third level, until after a certain period does not exceed 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own findings, often "she's sick" during the year.
It's all about the sky.
UNIPOL: ROBROSSIA: DANILO COUPOL GROTTATERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinado, president of the second criminal member of the Roman Court, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, who had wanted to move from his residence to a Roman residence in Grottaferra.
For the sake of the economic advantage of Coppola, an ongoing investigation into the issue of the Single-BNL-Party Agreement.
In the past week, during the anti-initiated procedure, the household was restored and the housing situation for Grottaferatara was changed.
The lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella were asked to transfer the owner to the capital of the village.
According to the Court, however, these investigations (which have been proposed by the prosecutor) would allow the company to influence its affairs and to make it accessible to the evidence presented against it.
The product is in danger
The scene was already emotional a few days ago when the House of Commons did not vote for the 700 billion dollar package that had been added by the White House: the Americans were interested in a significant part, and still interested in the destruction of Wall Street rather than the saving of the economy.
This is also supported by the New York Times of the past, which reported that the current crisis has resulted in a rise in the Republican Parton, which shows increasing participation among the traditional, recognizable, the federal institutions and business circles of the Eastern Party, and a growing trend in the medium and southern states, between Washington and the new world anti-financial guidelines.
This Directive has been published in a critical manner during the vote of the representative House of Representatives mentioned in the introduction.
The above event, however, is only one of the major changes that you will see or see before the current economic competition, and not only in the United States but in the whole rest of the world, perhaps beyond that.
It seems that the crisis in the United States and Europe only speeds up the signs of a good time map, which are being drawn into this new atmosphere and finally into the world.
The first of these is the return of the second category of renewal, the second category of State sovereignty to education, in relation to the single re-establishment of the economy.
The crisis affects the same banking institutions that establish such a close relationship with the outside world, but first and foremost, and possibly spread around people and families who live in a single country.
This, however, is a direct political difficulty for those who are in power: what will be the response to the difficulties and pressures of people who are simply elected?
Thus, in the economic sense of the crisis, it seems to be as global as it is in political terms as it is only national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially out of the question: this is an old evidence of the European Union, which is unable to identify a uniform policy guide between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, everyone from each national government is expected to enter into a package of savings, resales and new rules, but mainly open funds: because in this situation, only individual States have economic resources, financial equipment, which can be managed to do things properly.
They also have tools and capabilities to use them: in these circumstances, there are two sources of invaluable value, which are likely to never have any other market and one international organisation in such a way.
However, the new voice set up by the crisis to the nation is in full agreement with the fact that economic growth in recent times has an increasingly important factor, which is closely related to this element: this is territory.
In the same way as paradox, as we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the more advanced technology has gone into the world, and we were convinced that the global financial world has made it possible to control the world once we have to realize that our future is more and less dependent on things like water, nature and oil.
From things that can be so transferred from one planet to the other, they can be attached to one place in full order, one area.
Thus, he who controls the area has much more than he who has been born in a place where there is no natural, no oil, and no water.
I'd go through this to the second novelty, which has a kind of cross-section.
Anyone who says that the area, the state, the government, is also saying, as necessary, politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two consonants:
Partly is the objective recognition that there is a need for reliable guidance, for those who can take the events into their own hands.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular the full credit of economic leaders, who have proved totally inappropriate and have proved that much has gone before.
Both are even more important and are more refreshing in a certain sense: a sense of credibility, intolerance, inapplicability and impartiality, which is still affecting the whole leadership in a more prosperous country.
So it seems that the population is growing closer to the conviction that the social crisis that has taken place so far is over. Recently, even before their works, their experiences, their lifestyles, their cultures, in the sense of the complex word, would have been made to themselves. This social element is becoming more and more interested in the majority's opinion.
Similarly, the demand for leadership, in a complicated form, but strong delegation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. These voters are not expected to be in the "citizens", or in recent times to make rapid changes to the common interest. For example, the power of conservatives in Austria and Belarus, the integration of the labour force in Great Britain, or the pursuit of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the success of the Italian side can also be achieved here).
It seems that the traditional elite, its partners, its programmes, and we could say that in a society with its regularity, media and reputation, it is becoming less and less understood, and that this is why it is less likely to represent what a time is ending in the deeper parts of the modern society. Moreover, the economic crisis is growing, widening and potentially increasing.
In spite of all of them, it would be too much to speak of "the crowd being in a hurry."
But it's not worth it to walk with an open eye.
We can ride the sidewalk with a superpowered giant.
With the help of a superpowered rapist to overcome gravity and to walk away like Pokeman.
This goal was to fire several U.S. research centres in front of you, and a group set up by four institutions is approaching the solution.
The researchers were able to cut a 100 kilograms of body into an independent wall and hold it there.
TANULMANY - The American Journal of Science published the findings of a number of researchers at the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the scientific group has been born from the further development of existing, special, non-nautical structures in the 20th century.
"The harsh operating principle must be seen as a system similar to a package of spaghetti," says Hong Lin Wang, a researcher in the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers have explained the idea of a foot covered with giant microscopic fibers that provides perfect care for the animal.
The tests carried out with different substances, such as glass, teflon and cysole paper, have shown that the new sprayer is ten times more effective than the above-mentioned stalkers, while they are "swiftly removed from the gap", explains Liming Dai, a researcher of the daily unit's measuring car.
FALON JÁRENI? - "This material can be useful as a temporary ingredient" - add Liming Dai.
We can store the leaf, just like Pokeman? Maybe yes, but researchers think more about using a less amazing use than connecting electronic equipment, because toothpaste drives heat and electricity prices well.
Additional applications can be found in the area of radiation.
Superheroes can still wait.
MESSI’S JOY – the California Barkeley Unit is also testing a new explosive.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society c., Californian scientists have shown a hairy, microsatelic substance that is passed through the motion of the surface, thus providing a perfect supply.
Medicines?
Care should be taken with grapefruits, oranges and apples.
These high vitamins, mainly popular alcoholic beverages, if they are added to the body with certain life-threatening medicinal products, change their absorption, if appropriate, to improve or reduce their effect. This may also have serious health consequences.
The risk of the joint use of bozos or fresh fruits and certain medicines was expressed by Professor David Bailey of London University of Western Ontario. At a meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia in 236, the professor said that a glass of grapefruits, oranges or apples could reduce the exposure of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing good effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit has been used in the past to treat the defendants when it has been shown that some antibiotics, antihistamines, sarcoids, heart rate control and anti-diabetics may appear to be toxic.
COCCAZATIONAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago you were published by the Olass Medical Institute in its official address, and at once warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-consumption and to observe what medicines are being taken, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
BEFORE THE GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, oranges and apples also contain substances that interfere with the efficacy of medicinal products.
For a long time, it may be possible to draw up the list of active substances that are prevented by the grapefruit and other fruits.
Professor Michele Carruba of the United States Medical School in the United States of America notes this point: "These findings are usually made immediately by different national and international medical institutions, who, if necessary, are concerned about changing the information contained in the information provided by the notified body.
Therefore, it is always necessary to read the package leaflet, and if something is not understood, let us not be affected, but ask your doctor or pharmacist" - he stressed to the experts of the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Public Finance
The US Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Social Affairs, Trade Models and the regional relations of economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokinesian Krugman, Princeton University, is a well-known publisher of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the smallest judges of the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush government.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron was arrested, Krugman, in a guide published in the New York Times, pointed out that the last event will have even more devastating consequences in view of the United States' history than the concentration of terrorist attacks.
This announcement has not only raised a few questions, but it has also been addressed to the public administration, but today we know it was correct.
"I am also impressed, and a little too much to think about how quickly Enron or Worldcom's botanical combination has gone beyond the average interest rate," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "ropper-valued publicist", while possibly "progressively spreading the criticisms of the Bush government overliberalism."
Open Office, third edition also understands the "Microphone" package
Today, it features an Open Software application package that increases the productivity of OpenOffice.org 3.0, which aims at increasing levels as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, free of charge to government.
After almost one year of work done by the SUN Microsystem and by volunteer developers, the new Open Office has taken on a number of innovations to the public: in the welcome area and in the newly created, less-favoured, less-favoured users, it also offers more important innovation. For example, Apple Mac OS X is compatible with the operating system and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format according to the new ISO standard.
Special attention was paid to the compatibility with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can also open new expanded Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It is interesting to see some other module specific functions, such as reducing the size of the PowerPoint indicators. This can be useful for e-mail file transfer. Another feature supports importing into the PDF file graphical module, with the maintenance of the site settings.
We can also create hybrid PDF documents on this surface that combine the typical Adobe format with the table manager or editor elements.
The internal distribution of applications has also been developed in a number of ways: the Table Manager supports the common use of workgroups, but prevents the creation of other work. All workers' comments are marked by a different color, which helps to make it easier to identify.
Some companies are already working to make some of the OpenOffice's functions available on the Internet (on the cloud, above) so that the final change can probably be introduced in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available in English since the five pages of the mirror, can be filled with: http://it.openooffice.org/download/0.0/download300.html
The software package is available to Linux in addition to normal Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can buy the installation CD either at home or at our place of work.
With regard to the spread of home use, freedom probably means the biggest attraction, but the Open Office software package is now trying to attract the business sector, as it can be counted on a number of government and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business stages.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-based text editor; Calc, Excel-placed table manager; Impress, Powerpoint; Dbase is the most popular, Access database manager; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The 2008 target is 5 million downloads, but if we consider that we already have over 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
The score of the ball is also positive, this is the fourth dopping game.
In the last phase of Tour de France, one of the participants, a group of contestants Bernhard Kohl, who won the record of the best climber, also won the trick.
The news of the day on the website of the Team's Internet News.
The 26-year-old Kohl is a fourth competitor, the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepol, and the German, following the third generation of the EPO, Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test.
Like tests performed in the past few weeks, the laboratory of lasanne and Chatenay-malabry have been studied.
If control tests also confirm the positive performance of Cera, the districts will lose their third location and, according to the regulations, they will be exempted from competition for two years.
The report of the third generation EPO test by Kohl was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Doppingese Agency, and announced with the Associated Press Agency: he presented the positive doppling situation to the authorities of the districts.
The 26-year-old districts of Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans were able to stand for their success, and they also won a shining triumph for the best mountain range.
COVER SUBJECT: A NEW YORK IS POSSIBLE FOR THE backbone of a friendship?
Italy has only recently changed from foreign countries to one of the most desirable destinations for the prospective immigrants.
This question arises from the case of young Burkina Faso by Abdul William Guibre - who had been killed in Milan last month because he had lost a box box - a long article in Italy about racism.
The event well illustrates what the New York Times called "paradoxion of winters": in the northern regions "the strongest integration and the highest employment" while the "immigrant resistance and the North League's support" is also stronger in the country.
To support the growing gap between Italians and immigrants, the NYT is also responsible for events in Milan, Parmá, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
It's true.
New laws followed by the League, which would make the trainee more closely involved in immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, as examples of the change in voices in Italy.
The same trend is expressed by the President of the Pope and the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI, met with members in the Quirinale Palace, and agreed that the State and the Church should work together to ensure the conquest of racism."
The students suffer from expensive rental fees, even if a room is set up in 900 euros
The market for hotels issued by universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, Residents' Association, one student can pay nearly 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The presence has already shown such amazing sizes, which - due to the three key costs for families - prevents students from learning opportunities," explains Laura Mariani, director of the Sunia Study Office. "In these cities, the high demand for students has been so high that the market has also resulted in a general love process against local residents."
In most cases, the owners also have a series of irregularities: contracts not registered, non-restricted, related to subcontracts.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed which would allow the review of the tax system to maximize prices.
The survey shows that in Milan, around Brianza, a bed is required for 450 euros; the price per room is averaged from 650 euros (Bande Near) to 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it is also available to 900 euros (Vittoria district).
In Florence, a bed is made up of about 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students live near the university, a bed is made up of 250/280 euros, if double, and 370-500 euros, if it is one room.
In Rome, nearby universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) require about 600 euros for a private and 450 bed in a double room.
With some cheaper (EUR 550 per room) prices around the other university (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save everything in the outdoor areas: 300 euros and 450 in a single room Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar areas.
On Sunday, 300/450 euros are requested for a bedroom, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The hotel is located near Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Ameni.
In Bari, you need to pay for a bed room of EUR 250/350 and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are much lower in absolute value, but they represent greater weight in urban budgets.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another problem: the demand for foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian immigrants.
Welcome to the old Cinema Paradise, the time of the old mosaics in the cities
Traditional music is closed for the Multiplexes.
"A city where there is no music, a blind city, like a face without a face."
The photos produced by Giuseppe Tornatore are presented effectively all that is in the Italian capitals, but also in the rural regions.
The reduction of music - the appearance of large, multi-heavy music in foreign cities and, as a result, the cancellation of the buildings found in the city centers - seems inevitable and irrevocable, but at the same time conducts all the features of a true cultural crime.
When history and memories seem to be full of places, "that's like going to a friend, a famous one with whom we shared our lives and many experiences," says the director of the Cinema Paradiseo. The film, which reported to Tornatore a hundred years ago, and the big picture of the Cannes festival, describes the story of a small city music live, the story of the story of the opera, after a movie that may have been lost to us all.
The largest group of workers, the data published by Anec, is widely spoken: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed. The biggest loss in the cities of music could be recorded: 10 cinemas in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin, and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna lives in the most affected regions, which has lost 82 exclusive music, followed by Toskána (44) and Lombardia (41).
And for them to disappear, the production of the multiplexes is not evidenced any more than in Italy's three regions of the highest number of new-opened multi-heat music: in the last five years, the number of the product increased in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagná.
"The number of Italian units has increased in a radical way," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It's okay that we build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of the already existing ones, because when a city's music locker, not all of them are willing to move into the multiplexes.
It is also not talking about the unskilled financial basis for the support of operators: the State's loss of EUR 10 million.
In ethical and moral terms, it is also shameful that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
To maintain the market, it would take EUR 16-18 million a year."
This is the first Italian city to be concerned about the closures to address the problem through the government and the agreement between Anec in order to protect and regulate foreign and domestic perfect music.
The tax incentives provided for operators and the benefits offered to the public to promote the accessibility of the provision: viewers can enter the restricted roads and park with a favourable price.
"This initiative is being followed," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional music, to be able to combat the struggle with the rule of multiplexes, needs to be improved at sound and skill, as today's public needs are better.
The traditional music show was always important to me: the closure of Supercinema in Nigeria - where I spent my children and young people - gave me the scar that I ended up doing the Cinema Paradise, although I had spent ten years on it.
I live in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale before the closed Rialto or Quirinale, I don't see the posters covered by the gate, I'm going to turn my head. I've been here for so long."
Serious conflicts between politics and 'dragnity, arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in the decision-making of the government."
There were serious accusations against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Gioio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno against Carlo Martelli, who were detained in the foreign court this morning.
Bilinks was made by Gioacchino Piromalli, a leading mediator between the clan and the administration, and the same name with the head of the lawyer, who had already been convicted for having been involved in a mafia crime treaty and received EUR 10 million.
"The rule of law and morality has nothing to do with it, which is more desirable," the government reports. The two local governments have expressed their intent to pay the council's fee to Piromelli lawyers.
"The clan would have been officially accessible to the city, which would have given further opportunity to monitor and direct the administration, which could be said to be important.
Agazione Loiero, president of the Calabrian region, does not hide that in the region there is "a number of mergers between the local institutions and the organised sub-world": There are areas where the spread of mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the merger is almost impossible.
However, a number of local politicians are opposed to the pressure of 'draggata, they are the heroes who remain clean'.
This morning's arrests are the continuation of Jewish events, while the police announced that they had succeeded in completing the Piromalli clan.
Finally, in April, local politicians were relieved of their commitment to the administration of the government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a retired Christian Democrat mayor at the time of the revolution, was born in the second half of 2006.
He issued a petition when the House of Commons ordered the suspension of the Committee of Government.
Mr Mininini, Deputy Deputy Minister of the Akhori, was brought before the Court and accused him of planning everything for political purposes, but the Court, in the detention order signed this morning, explained that the Piromalli clan had so far been involved in pursuing a change in the A3 project.
As regards Dal Torrion, it is clear that the government's decisions "was intended to be extended to meet the demands of business representatives of the nearby Piromalli family, and to subsidize the government's decisions."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the great ones come.
An unexploded energy source that makes up 70 percent of the planet's surface, which is currently being covered by major international energy companies
The waves, the tides, the tides, all the renewable energy resources, which have taken my face like Chevron, who are now trying to reach their hands.
For hundreds of years, they've been studying the possibility of getting energy from sea motions. In the '70s, research increased during the first oil year.
About 1980, when oil prices decreased, the idea of the use of marine energy was jeopardised, but today the demand for environmental protection and the re-increasing price of oil gave rise to new developments in the sector.
According to the 2007 World Energy Council (WEC) estimates, 15 percent of the world’s electricity price needs could be met with facilities that use the deceleration of the seas.
This amount is twice the amount currently established by atomic instruments.
There's still prices and prices up there.
The horrors are on the way.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to maritime energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in Northern Portugal.
It looked like a turning point when the signature was signed.
It has been two years since, and more and more companies have been involved in maritime energy, including those who have been the advocates of conventional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies, and takes into account the possibility of cooperation with us," said a spokesman for an American oil company, the Wall Street Journal.
This cooperation concerns the acquisition of the authorisation required for the launch of a project for the use of marine energy by the American Energy Agency.
The issue is not of any importance, especially in view of the fact that the US is currently continuing oil production in Alaska, which President Bush has recently launched a plan on additional fuels.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are the channel of energy from the sea. The amounts already invested, as far as the details can be known, give evidence of increased interest.
Technology is waiting for development.
Experts say that there is still an initial technology, but only because the energy available from the sea does not give rise to doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing, Portuguese or Scotia-like facilities are all small, so they do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to increase energy production, there is a need for structures that are even more important to the environment.
There are several possibilities: for example, Ocean Power uses a combined bowel system.
They are made up of wires and wires that are moving up and down the pipes, and they are made by hydraulic pressure of the tubes and wires placed in them.
Printing takes a turbine, and it's on a generator table.
The electric price comes to the coastal surface of the sea by means of steaming cables.
At the same time, there are four similar structures in the design phase, which are already waiting for the federal permit. The energy produced would be used in a military facility.
The Verdant Power, however, has already started energy production for a shopping center and a parking lot using six sea turbines located on the East River in New York.
The movement of the water will buy the turbine leaves, and this movement will cover the generator.
Verdant stated that he had a long list of partners waiting for only the permission to use energy.

Special attention is currently being paid to options to be considered through the market.
Although it is of age, the price market can be considered more predictable than the wind, the day, or the waves, so it can be considered a more reliable energy source.
New York, Maine and Alaska, and the other party countries spent $7.5 million in 2008 to increase the energy provided by the market, which is expected to be 35 million women in 2009.
