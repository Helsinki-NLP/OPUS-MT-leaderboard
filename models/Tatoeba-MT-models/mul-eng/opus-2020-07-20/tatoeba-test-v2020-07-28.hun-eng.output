If we do more, it'll get better.
It looks like it's worth it.
The bus driver didn't see the driver.
Tom didn't want to go there after dark.
I can't blame you.
Tom was betrayed for murder.
He wants to see his grandfather.
I'm worried about the future.
Come on, don't push the trigger!
I don't want to stop.
Mari, come quickly!
Tama's got another whiskey for you.
Tom, I mean, I'm a moment's optimist.
I'd like to learn German, but I don't have time.
Go! Go!
Shall I?
I gave Tomina my old hat.
I forgot about Tom.
Don't give me my number, Tomina.
Why do you need a new level?
The man's drinking coffee in the coffee shop.
The idea and practice are not necessarily shared.
I'm grateful for everything you've done.
Oh, please, don't say that.
We're eating with our teeth.
That's what it means.
I'm not the one you should keep from.
I feel the queens.
It's not complicated.
I don't want to listen to you anymore.
Are you really happy?
He's always scared.
Who the fuck is Tom?
Don't be like a baby.
Tom contributed to his testimony.
They're thieves.
I didn't answer your letter because I was too busy.
I was hoping it would happen in secret.
Steve didn't come home.

It's the secret of success.
Don't look at this.
That was really interesting.
Now the lesson.
What kind of painkiller can I give my dog?
The rainwater has been cut off from the roof.
Let me think a little more about this.
I'm curious what happened to Paul.
Alan likes his porn.
I don't know where Tommy used to buy food.
It's a stupid rule.
They're waiting for Citrus in my chest.
What did you say?
Don't you understand?
He always wanted to call you attention.
Three minutes ago, I understood the position that Tommy's been on the run.
The window is open.
Do you still hate it?
Can I join you?
He's not here at all.
He lives in a big house.
If you had stayed with us, you wouldn't have been in trouble.
I brought you some food.
Tom usually blames you.
The expert is in love language.
I'll be more patient.
I don't want to wait.
I can show you how to do it if you want.
In East Timor, it's the prosper of the film industry, as it used to be.
Most fats contain fluoride.
Go on!
I was having a really good time tonight.

Taro, get ready for dinner.
There's only five things on the list.
The box was so hard that Tom had to help Marie get home.
Do you have enough energy?
Get yourself your degree degree.
Please, call the rescuers.
But grandpa, Tommy's not gay, just trendy!
It's very hot.
I have to go.
Are you hot?
Tammas found a lost rock hole and bought it for himself.
Tom has a specific personality.
He was so eager to open the box.
You're extraordinary.
I thought you trusted me.
Tom didn't look like a marine disease.
I sat down and scared.
I can't see anything.
What did you buy?
No one knows the truth.
I love the dog.
You're already eating the cake?
Be basic.
Don't fuck with me.
It's better if you don't talk.
Tom used to be nice.
I'm usually scared.
Today is Tom and Mari's wedding anniversary.
Tom falsely accused Mary.
They're starting to call themselves.
You're coming with me.
Tom's not home.
What's wrong with you guys?
You want to dance with me?
It's been an exciting experience for you.
Tomina's got a long hat.
We're just starting now.
We're going to buy.
Tom followed.
They've been there for a long time.
Children are willing to hear the same story again and again.
We're with you.
Tom found out he made a mistake.
Open the window.
Have you been to Istanbul yet?
Tom apologized for not coming earlier.
Clear the part?
He's drunk.
Tom's pregnant.
We know you're sick.
I don't belong to you.
I cut my hand with Tom, and I went.
Is that the deal?
I'm just a little scared without you.
Gordon's been up all week.

That's good.
What did Tommy do in the bag?
Tom left the book.
I've never killed anyone. I've never killed anyone.
It's May's Friday.
That makes me sad.
The film got tough criticisms.
After work, it's sweet.
Tom had another cup of coffee for you.
Get the villa out of here.
That's incredible.
Are you still busy with him?
You seem to be embarrassed.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Of course you don't know anything about it.
Tom deserves to be free.
I'll come if the procedure permits.
He's got two dogs.
The immortality of the soul is a good thing.
Allig knows Tomit.
It doesn't make sense to compare them.
It doesn't matter how important this meeting is.
We were both safe.
I don't have any money.
I think that would explain everything.
He's gone to dinner.
Telling and acting aren't the same.
Say it.
This boy is Fisher Tomi.
It's just temporary.
He was tennis last night.
Hey, how are you?
It's a beautiful dress.
Which teaching hours do you like most?
I was the last one I saw him.
It's gonna take a little time to add to your eyebrows.
I appreciate your friendship.
Did you get out of here for the first time?
I need you to check it out.
I ate it.
Tommy's family needed money.
Fire's out.
Give me time to think about it.
Why did you buy this ring?
It's my farm, and it's not selling!
The name's disgusting.
I love the kids.
Your mother's not as old as she looks.
Turn this thing over.
The boy got into the water.
I don't have a name.
She had red hair and a red blood count.
Please write my address.
Tom's dead?
I was happy for an hour until I found out where I had to go.
He was attracted to the desert.
In this case, the judge didn't go to sports.
That's a very bad idea.
Changes are coming.
Who are you talking to?
Everything can be called a language that has a report.
Tommy said he had to leave.
That's all I needed.
Can you do that again?
When I forgot my promise, it became very angry.
I don't understand.
Tom's perfect.
How long are you going to school?
Tom lives with us.
I was hoping you'd heal.
I still can't tell you why.
I'm on my own.
It's not too much.
He called this morning.
No, no, that's for me.
I don't want to be selfish.
I'd think twice in your place if I chose this road.
I don't know what your kid is.
It's one of my stupid luck.

Tom's pretty cute.
There's a house in the door.
The three great monotheist religions are Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.
I couldn't take it back.
I still don't know why you did it.
Would you like to be famous?
It's an exception.
You're not my boss.
I'm just a average guy who doesn't have a loser.
I didn't say anything.
Tom didn't know what Mary was talking about.
Tom doesn't know what happened because he wasn't there.
No one can help us.
He hasn't seen this world yet.
Tom can help.

Your father devoted his life to science.
He just gave me a toll.
I always wanted to meet you.
Why is he home?
The water was cut off because he didn't pay the bill.
Never stop talking to strangers.
Are you really sure?
Tom is now French.
I'm not home yet.
I'd save my life, too.
It was hard first.
I'm worried about what he said.
I don't know if that matters.
How did the traffic accident happen?
I think Tam√°s wants to do it tomorrow.
It's just him.
We're competitive.
Idiots, you deserve the buck.
I spent the whole day digging in front of my machine.
I should have come here first.
He didn't go to church at all.
Let me sleep ten more minutes.
My wife is a prostitute.
From this we learned that no one can trust anyone.
Who can blame you?
This isn't gonna happen.
Look at that mountain.
Leave that poor boy alone.
You speak French very well, and I'd like to speak this language as well as you.

It's gonna be fine.
Have you increased your skills?
I know he's still there.
It's healthy.
There's been an exciting conversation in the distance.
Of course I do.
You seem tired, but Tommy doesn't.
Please call me if he's coming closer.
Whoever it is, we can't do anything else than trust it.
Let's see what's the result.
I love this book at best.
I didn't drink alcohol for six months.

Are you sick?
The penis got into the hole.
I heard everything.
How long has Jokoham been involved?
Tom's a typical English.
It's me.
Can I call you sometimes?
It doesn't matter how late you're getting dressed, but get out of here tomorrow morning.
He's got two chicks, one white and the other black.
It's a lot more crazy than I thought.
My apartment is more comfortable than yours.
Science is important in our lives.
We love each other, but we don't live any longer.
Tom wants that too.
This is my bedroom.
I was married at the time.
It's like your grandfather.
We're planning to take off the mountain.
Same age.
It's a crime.
He did it like he couldn't hear his boss.
You know, when you think about yourself, you know.
Let me look at these pictures.
I'm probably able to do very little.
I don't need anything.
No one said that before.
Some of his dog's learned prints.
It's ruined.

He learned a new word.
That's something.
Do you know where they live?
The patient is in constant concern.
How, please?
Tom needs your help.
You're preparing a proposal?
We'll be free.
Is that what you want to do?
He likes to watch baseball games on TV.
It's our help.
He's leaving home early every Sunday.
I've got news.
Stop or I'll shoot.
Tom will miss me very much.
I want another look.
I was the greatest man in the world.
I didn't think I'd ever get to sleep on the floor.
Did you feel anything about me?
Tom's too much to go home.
Just do it, that's a good feeling.
You're a strong guy, aren't you?
He rode one in the morning.
I was scared yesterday.
My dad's just improving my broken bike.
Russia Europe or Asia?
You love coffee better.
I'll make sure Tom helps you.
Tommy hid behind a tree, but so did I.
They're missing.
I'd rather be going.
A black BMW park in front of your house.
I'm going back to Boston.
I don't understand him again.
There's a new dictionary under planning.
I see a rose.
Let me do something else.
Let's keep talking in English, please.
This is the least I can do.
You don't know his name?
What are the symptoms?
We've been too young.
Intelligence.
Did you know that?
It's my oldest son.
He was injured in the accident.
Everyone's sick.
I didn't mean to show you that.
What's that?
He's not married.
Here's a higher temperature than in Tokyo.
We need more than that.
I'm too old to go to Australia.
Fuck.
They made a mistake.
I haven't talked to Tom about that yet.
What's in these guys?
You can't say anything else.
I don't want to believe that.
You didn't die.
One of my children is sick.
Listen to me, please.
Tom's barely waiting for his birthday party.
He's very young, much younger than Tom.
It's a condition, it's not.
You know what I'm talking about.
You're not God.
What's the matter with you?
I've been a member of the parent working community ever since.
Tom pushed his cat.
I'm still looking for work.
I can't believe you.
We can change our background for the benefit.
This is the blue pam.
I don't want to live in Boston.
You're a dead man if you don't.
He's the only one I know and can do the job.
You're still a sister, aren't you?
He couldn't come because of his illness.
He didn't promise to come back.
Tomina's got a long way to go.
It was once, where it wasn't, it was once an old man.

What a bad movie!

She's particularly upset about this.
I don't think I understand.
The options are coming, they're going.
I heard a confession.
My boss is a cop.
Don't tell me you don't like chocolate.
You mind if I sit here?
Are you excited?
Try some.
He gave him all the details.

Cars must leave at least one metre wide sand when passing along bicycles.
Tom always tells Mari that he loves her.
Everyone's got a tattoo.
Sit down and tell me how you came out of this terrible mess.
Why did you come here?
I could have done it on my own, I think.
I'm surprised you didn't bring Tomit with you.
We were all very happy.
I don't like it, not even if she loves me.
Tom usually helps do my homework.
Tom's sick.
You should throw this out.
How many stops are there?
Please tell me how I'm going to Boston.
I didn't mean it at all.
That would've been a good fight.
The import of rare wastes into this country is certainly expensive.
Mormon creditors are working together.
The elevators are rising at a slow rate.
I've learned a lot about Tommy.
Tom told them not to do this.
What's wrong with you?
He's been reading a lot.
Tom doesn't mean it.
My grandfather founded the company, and my parents continue to succeed.
Tom's not special.
I fought the test.
That would be a wise thing.
Maybe someone can help you.
Would you like to answer some questions?
How long has it been there?
There's a lot of cities in Brazil.
Thank you for your answer.
It's very nice of you.
Tom asked why I was sad.
You're a victim of a betrayal.
Why should this interest us?
Ferenc came to Gale√£o in six days.
Do you like the rosfort?
You went too far.
There's no money.
How fast!
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd go with him.
Tom didn't shoot once.
Who cares about this dog?
That's good to know.
It's me!
What a beautiful flower!
The Dodgers were despised by the Giants.
It's getting hot.

The coming of the moon is half a million.
I don't know what they heard about Tom.
Hold your hand with me.
This is Tatoe.
Do you know his father?
There's a lot of photos in this book.
I'll be right back.
That's pretty serious.
Honey.
I've got a new wallet.
Who's got the phone.
You can come tomorrow.
We should finish this.
The sound came from the direction.
You'll have to tell the whole story.
It's unexpected for everyone.
I should've been there sooner.
I'm a bear.
I advise you to let Tomit go.
Can I take off my watch?
He's going to spend a lot of money.
Tom saw a snowflake.
Go, but don't count on me.
They pay me enough.
Athens, I was born in 1956.
It's an excellent idea.
He wasn't interested.
Why should you be so upset?
Tom's night-stared robot.
It didn't work in Tatoe.
Now don't call me Tomit.
I think I'm stupid?
Do you want to talk to me right now?
These books?
I like the orange juice.
He's drinking some peaches.
Tom, come on!
I'm here.
I'll find you earlier.
This bus takes you to the station.
I know I should've left earlier.
I want to be young again.
I still don't know if I can be there.
I know I can't do as well as Tom.
I've got a high-end.
Hello, Tam√°s, good morning.
Tom's been working all day without a break.
Tom has a lot of enemies.
What did he tell them?
The cars are expensive.
About what?
I want to learn justice.
There is a difference between them.
You're gonna help her, aren't you?
Oh, how much I miss you!
Who made this cake?
I don't understand the question.
Honey, are you all right?
Is that normal?
How did the music like it?
Robbie's not with you.
Make sure Tom told you everything.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
I hope I'm not scared.
When was this temple built?
You need Tomina.
This mucus has diaallergy.
I'd do it if I had more time.
He made his books into his sons.
Tom and Mari are wearing hats that are too big for them.
My mind went through all my pockets.
Don't make it like he's got a lot.
Let me explain.
Look what Tom found under the bed.
She gave him food.
The elephant is a very big animal.
Whatever I do, he says I can do it better.
Because when I saw you, the whole room became beautiful.
Every writer suffers from depression for a time.
Thank you for everything.
Go through the orange coast.
Tom's got a phone call.
Dani knew Linda had a relationship with someone for a while.
I think my neighbor might have died.
All of them?
I want to pick it up.
Tommy's on the line.
I'm glad you're here.
I hope you understand what I'm thinking.
What do you want?
We have to pay more.
Is the competition so bad?
Don't tell me again!
You don't have a lot of places on the table.
Then her mother thought.
Not everyone's got a master's skills.
You'll decide if you don't move any more.
If you don't want to read, don't read.
Do you know this song?
No one talked to me.
I moved all the money I had to buy the book.
Tominas don't have to shave his hair.
They don't speak English here.
Through this door, you can get close to the kitchen.
When his wife died, he received several dozen card cards.
I should have been a lot more basic.
I'm materially independent of my parents.
Last night, I was out in front of the TV.
This has to happen.
You understand how you can get me up.
As they sank, the wall was completely dark, and the sides of the gates were covered with dust.
That's not true, that's bullshit!
Tom's very lucky.
Looks like the bus was ready.
Take care of the zsobtojocto.
Let me tell you.
Tom lied in his testimony before the court.
Five and two in the week.
Nobody saw my fear, just me.
We loved Tom.
It's about smoking.
You got enough time?
We've got to pray.
Everything hurts him.
He shot you with a gun.
Move it!
My parents are home now.
I asked you to date me, but he didn't say anything.
That's illegal.
I'd like to look at the labyrinth contests.
The best defense is the attack.
She's gonna die.
When are you coming?
Tom's not stupid at all.
It's a pretty big box.
It's important that parents stand on one side when the line is raised.
There's another thing.
They saw him cross the street.
I'm interested in Japanese history.
Please don't say anything.
They know I do.
Tom already said.
Even though we're smart, he didn't want me to have sex.
You don't have to work today.
Don't ask so many.
It's raining here.
You can make a difference.
Yeah, and here's a picture of the farm where we're going to finish the teas.
The education did what I am.
The accident took place two hours ago.
It'd have been better if you'd come with the ship.
He pulled his head off.
Tom's hyperventilant.
I hate to talk.
He informed the police about the traffic accident.
You don't live here, do you?
We're ready.
I feel a lot better.
Tom lives in Boston with both of his grandparents.
Did you know his name?
Take care of yourself.
We need to get out of here.
Tommy, why don't you go to your room?
Tom brought the French to Germany.
Any post office can take notes.
She wants to raise her family.
You can't leave.
I hate fanatics.
He swore to leave the game.
The quality of translation has improved.
It won't be easy.
Don't think of me as an average person anymore.
Bob, please help put your sister in the big room.
It doesn't make sense to wake up in the past.
Is this my place or yours?
Just in time.
No hope.
It's the same.
I want to be a guitar.
Do your job!
Don't look.
We don't have time to lose for a minute.
If you're around your house, what kind of shelter and buildings can you see?
Who's got all the money?
Of course, why not?
You have to apologize.
Double or nothing?
I didn't sleep.
It's a day we're going to do.
You want to say something, Tom?
Tell us what it is.
Which judge examined the case?
I don't think he'll fly.
I'm in a mess.
I'll see you today.
Hi, old friend.
Anybody home?
Sleep's impossible for health.
I'll make you a sandwich if you want.
Only those who live here know what the cold is.
I'm sorry.
He met a coward.
That's the past.
I'm trying to control myself.
You opened the door.
It's a good price for this suit.
He's out to go abroad.
It's a very old book.
He's always asking for your opinion.
It's round, clumsy, and it's not harmonizing with anything, but at least they don't get out of the dark.
It's a wise choice.
It's not that far.
There are many schools in this city.
This city has a lot of TV.
They're good hunters.
I haven't eaten anything since morning.
I'm still sad.
Do you know his name?
We should try harder.
Have you seen more than three meters of coffee?
Who ran away?
Let's ask them.
Please, give me your papers by the end of the month.
That's priceless.
Tom's got it.
Do they have grandchildren?
Turn to me, please.
I love him very much.
I used to be there to get a good place.
Give me the number of the trip and the date of birth.
I can't thank you enough.
It's big.
Tommy showed Mari the way.
I need coffee.
Tommy's asking his question.
Tomi made Marit a cup of tea.
Tell him you're lying.
They were so happy when we arrived.
What are you talking about?
It's a pretty stone wall.
I found it on the floor.
Tom's waiting.
Look at you.
It's an idea to relax.
He explained the rule to me.
I'll stay.
It's not important to touch this old building.
We can't do it anymore.
I took my shoes off.
Everyone's fine.
That's what you need.
Tom can't use it.
Hanni and Nanni are awake.
Mary wore pink blue.
They're home.
The white building is in a hospital.
Next year, Tam√°s and I will go to Boston.
Nice skin.
It's the cheese juice.
That was the only thing I had to do.
There's no speed limit.
Where's my strength?
Your neighbor is a liar.
You have to.
My mother didn't allow me to behave as a minister.
I'm more important than you.
When's the last time you ate the graffiti?
Tom didn't have a lot to say.
These are all mine.
He's not here yet.
He turned his pockets up.
There's no elevator in the building, I can barely sleep because of my bad lands.
That's enough.
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things, or resurrection, and none of the dead knows anything; or, as we are told, a real change: the soul's redemption from this place to another.
Don't blow it.
That was an obvious question.
If you read the book, can you give me a loan?
If you were to end up telling me not to be angry, I probably wouldn't be so angry.
It's just natural.
What are you doing?
I'll take my way back to the pancake.
Tom felt that it would be a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.
At least you don't know anything about that animal.
Take care of yourself.
When Tom woke up, Mari got tired.
Get the fuck out of here!
I deserve everyone.
The mechanic's been successful.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Is he sick or a doctor?
Tom was an aggressive child.
The air becomes red in two or three weeks.
No one can live for two hundred years.
He's still calling me from time to time.
Something's wrong.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm asking you for a lift room.
He's probably sleeping.
The lasa has fallen apart.
He must be Tom's brother.
It was you, wasn't it?
Can you tell me the name of this man?
I'm looking for someone.
I can't see the forest from the tree.
Would you please talk to me a little bit later?
I like green tea.
It was a tragic accident.
I don't count.
The rich are getting richer.
I don't have much time.
I need to get to the station.
Do you think he knows that I love him?
I lived in Boston.

No point.

They've been busy with this for hours.
She was born to be an organizer.
I tried to forget.
We'll pay for the account.

There's a problem.
Looks like the day was in a place.
Who thinks that?
You're not gonna stop them with pain.
Tom's getting sick, too.
Tom started to treat her.
Tom bought Mary a drink.
The young woman was so beautiful that even the devil wanted to take her.
Because I stopped my bus.
I'm going to make a living on the count so I don't touch anything.
We have to do it now.
Shall I take you home?
Tom is hopeless.
Did you follow the law?
I'm not the teacher.
Very gentle.
It's too cold for the shower.
The collection of my favorite old games.
Tomina was supposed to rest.

Everything happened voluntarily.
I found Tomit.
We've got a great day.
We tried to warn them.
I'm proud of you, Tomira.
Strong faith.
You're learning math at the university.
He used it.
He likes to break the electrical equipment.
You were undeterred.
It was very easy.
It's a collection machine.
They love my mom.
I don't have time to cry.
Don't forget to write to me.
Everyone worked hard.
Where are you living in Turkey?
The blue is good for you.
Who did you go there with?
The design of the theater made it possible for the public to draw close to the rapporteurs and to establish contacts.
I couldn't move my arms.
Excuse me, could you help me?
I can understand.
Can you hold on a few minutes?
Five hundred books are sure of it.
Was the mail here already?
It helps a little.
It was a wonderful day.
When do you get married?
He's been trying to call Tam√°s Marie.
Let him go!
Maria's doctor.
Is that your money?
I didn't get used to this kind of abuse.
Today's kids can't separate the tobacco from the work.
It's just a concert.
My mom took my ass off.
Follow my heart.
Get out!
Am I wrong?
Tom was lucky.
It's just amazing.
I know.
I appreciate what Tom did.
Tommy's happy he's finished.
Why are you picking up that tree?
He took me to the palace.
There's a woman who wants to talk to you.
They told him to stand up and he did it.
That's the silver.
We respect them very much.
How do I get to the airport?
Tom's got everything you're doing for money.
You need a good little rest.
We've got a good day.
You just have to work harder.
That's a good dream.
We need a change.
It takes about 10,000 hours to teach a basic language.
It's been two years since she left.
He lost all his money.
It's not hard.
I've been in Tokyo for three years and I've been living here since.
Believe in the man's immortality.
You're gonna call the villa, and there's a lot of dark here.
They warned you not to get out of school multiple times.
I found the key.
Tom saw it.
All clear!
Where did you send it to Boston?
Tom's gone.
The main beauty is in her character, not in her books.
It's all Tommy's car in this garage.
That's a long story.
How much does he give the gold ring?
The story is written by the winners.
He's a lawyer.
I wish you wouldn't have looked like you were very fun.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I'd like to write hundreds of words on Tatoebe, but I have a job.
I'll pay later.
Tomina's got blood.
I work every day except Sunday.
Tom's gonna be red.
It's not your fault, is it?
My grandpas are starting to get insensitive.
You don't have to try.
Tom put his money in the bank.
Tom was great.
There's always room for improvement.

You should stop this.

Almost completely destroyed the hostages in this village.
I don't know who it is.
I've got the girl with me.
He loves himself.
You're magic?
My cat's black.
I'm going to go.
He tried to hide his concerns when the end came.
He's back here with some of his friends.
Tom works on Park Street.
We've been through a lot of months.
Can you speak French to your wife?
I waited for your answer, but he didn't hear from you.
There's no need for Tom to come if he doesn't want to.
We'll go back there.
It doesn't matter what you say, I won't listen to you.
Take it seriously.
The penguin is also called Astalitene.
It's part of it.
Please, go away.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Take care of your head.
He doesn't drink coffee.
I'm a little tired.
Forget it.
We're poor, but happy.
I respect Tommy.
Kint's completely dark.
Did you hear anything about him lately?
We'll wait three hours.
Apparently, Tom was late for the 19th Street business trip.
How did Tom answer?
It's hard to deal with.
It's Tom's big farm.
Good night, Mom.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom's time.
I can't imagine getting married.
Everyone says that food is very good in this restaurant.
Do you know what your children are eating?
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Mari loves the kids.
The team will be ready.
Then I wasn't ready for it.
They've all said they're sorry about the death.
What was the problem?
I mean, you're wrong.
Take a break.
The worm is one life, but the other is dead.
You can email me the file.
We need help out here.
On Sunday's free access.
Tom hid the evidence.
Stay away!
I warned Tomit.
The dog was dead.
I've never heard of him lying.
We didn't know which one they'd come up with.
We don't love our neighbors, and they don't love us.
He's the only one who survived.
I'm going to work with Buss.
I think Tom might be older than me.
Now you're done.
The burden hurt a little bit.
I'll give you a local sensor.
Good-bye at the weekend.
People can be so uncivilized.
That's disgusting.
We understand each other.
Tom would help us if he knew.
You should've followed Tommy's orders.
My wife and I want to get involved.
Tom hit him out of his mind.
Count it out of a dozen.
Someone stole my money.
Tam√°s, what's wrong?
He's bringing clothes from Turkey.
Do you take this kimono?
Do you have a fire?
Get me a good book from the library.
Tom's gonna stay.
Are you a nudist?
You haven't killed me like this yet.
Why don't you get yourself a bottle?
Who's this bag?
Mari's refurbished a house.
I wish I hadn't seen such a horrible movie!
I read this story in a book.
Please write your name.
Sorry about the delay.
Tom took my advice to nothing.
There's a lot of history books.
Don't give me anything!
The weighted body motion is affected by the bleeding.
It's all right in the office.
Don't you want a little orange?
I want coffee.
He couldn't cope with the new circumstances.
That's what I really love.
They must've been stolen.
We'll live as long as the rain lives.

We still need to know the truth.
Mari closed her eyes and started counting the moves.
Tom's drugged Mary.
Do you understand French?
There's no need to know how to connect a personal computer to the Internet.
He just took an hour.
I forgot about it.
Stay with me, Tom.
That's not right.
I think Tom never learned French.
It's great that he could come.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to ask Mary.
We don't like the race.
What happened last week?
Tom's getting pregnant.
I smell this song outside of me.
I'm not doing anything.
We appreciate his ability.
Tommy's got a debt on his shoulder.
Can you do this yourself?
Tom said he didn't see anything.
Take an asspire.
He's in school.
You're trying to get together, aren't you?
I've been reporting for you.
Tom will answer all your questions.
You'll need an alibi.
You're out of your mind.
Words give meaningful connotations to words. They have personality. They can be funny, causes, lips, life-threatenings, triggers, hurts.
No, it's not.
My book's not here.
Tom's coming home next week.
Mary told me she enjoyed the concert.
Why are you talking to me all the time?
The day comes out and rest quietly.
Tom's gonna kill me.
They eat healthy food.
He felt like Tom, he was thrown into hell.
This song reminded my kids.
I went out for you.
Take one of them.
Get the fuck out of here!
Who's that toll?
Who am I lucky for?
Is that binding?
Tom didn't seem to be busy as usual.
They're killers.
Tom's very busy.
Who cares?
I can't imagine how I could live without it.
Japan is my mother tongue.
He's gonna be there in my heart.
I think Tom was there already.
Tom is too dependent on Mari.
The boy made a new round for everyone.
Tom is a highly respected star.
I'm not your father.
The hope is always alive.
My mom likes the foci.
I'm fine.
I've never seen Tom dance.
There's nothing here.
I've never seen Tom here before.
The kids are already in bed.
I ate too much yesterday.
He's gone.
Tom's been quiet.
It was just funny.
He's no longer dependent on his parents.
Honestly, you're not right.
That's what they're talking about, and that's what they're talking about.
Why worry about that?
I drank a lot last night.
Do you have any money?
These are the things I like.
No one can see.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
You're convincing.
You're going to school with a bus?
John is a good friend of mine.
Aren't you coming with me?
I can't hear a word.
The kids are full of energy.
I love coffee better.
I'm still young.
He's a DJ.
Tommy tried to get to the night club.
Good night, little lady.
I asked him if he was going to go there the next day.
I had to do it alone.
Tom lied to me.
Last night, I was still alive.
The dog is the best friend of man.
Tom said Mari was crazy.
You haven't won yet.
At the time of his arrest, Tom lived in Boston.
I haven't done much lately.
I need more.
It doesn't matter what I do, my parents will never be happy.
Tom arranged an extra big pizza.
The body's dead.
I pressed a bad button.
I know Tom's done it.
I think you're worthy.
When he's in trouble, he always turns to his sister for help.
I didn't think Tom was going to Boston.
The rats don't normally attack the man.
Where's the next one?
The accuracy is important in the case of death.
I don't understand why it's important.
I understand you can come to the station?
I really don't know where to start.
I didn't want to cry.
They've all been killed.
Tom knows how things are here.
He's dancing.
My phone doesn't work.
Where do you think this happened?
Mari is one of the wildendorphs.
I'm studying at school with a lot of interest.
I'd like to explain it to you, but your brain's gonna get worse.
I hope you're right.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
If only I could be different.
Tom gave me my number.
Dan hit the man who tried to steal his car.
Tommy's been buying Marin's gun.
He admitted his mistakes.
You could've done it on your own.
The boy's been wrong.
They're part of it.
I wasted my money.
Do you have two windows in your room?
Tom's gonna shoot.
Be our guest.
Please answer.
Tommy won't listen to this.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
We're not friends.
Please, shut the door.
We don't have dogs.
It wasn't a very interesting reign.
Tom ended up hiding the product.
How long have you been waiting?
Do you like the white chocolate?
The night sky is beautiful and beautiful.
I'm not crying.
Tom gave Mari a heavy load to our wedding anniversary.
It's on the floor, my grandfather's first-aid equipment used in World War II.
Did Tom ever show you that letter?
They broke up with each other.
What's going on in your head?
They're both dead.
Everyone's changing.
That's right, honey.
It motivates personal anger.
If he didn't break up, don't fix it.
Always the same note.
I only have a brother.
Three years ago, I met her.
We're fighting a lot.
Explain to me why Tom's not here.
We're not going out to the party.
I hope so.
Thomas has two brothers, one lives in Boston, the other in Chicago.
My father's grandfather's devoted his hundredth life.
I want you, Tom.
The answers are more appropriate.
You have to work very hard.
He hates his F√°c.
They built a hall on the side of the car to separate the sound from the houses nearby.
I don't have enough money to pay you.
Are they celebrating us?
It was kind of weird.
I'll take you to the hotel.
That's good.
It's my watch.
I know the rules.
Neither Tom nor Mary has waited a long time.
That's the black scar.
The kids are innocent.
It was just a dream.
A girl writes.
Tommy opened the secret.
I'll be home in six o'clock.
It's just earlier.
The school accepted three American cheeses.
The milk is in the refrigerator.
I have to go there.
I'm not afraid of you anymore.
What a nice man!
The police have arranged an arrest warrant for the arrest.
You don't know how much I love you.
I'm worried.
They're missing, aren't they?
You're making a choice.
The day after the mountains rest in peace.
Looks like you want to take that dress.
- Look at that, Dad, a hat!
I want her luck.
Tommy's probably gonna be suspicious.
Tommy's strong enough to wake him up.
I thought Tommy was still living in Boston.
That's what I need.
Do you like this necklace?
Tom escaped from the prison on a plane.
I took something from you.
I don't want to keep busy with this.
Don't worry about your head.
You're not gonna convince him with these words.
He's not the man who opened the debate.
Tom wanted Mary to love him.
How many machines do you live in Greenland?
I burned my head.
You have to stop smoking.
They got Tom, they got a stolen car.
Tom's trying to explain.
Mom often says it's time money.
I don't know what to do anymore.
There was no visible danger.
I've never met anyone I've ever met.
I wish I could show Tom.
How much of the minimum beer in Chechnya?
If you speak in a language that you understand, it comes to your head; but if you speak in his language, it comes to your heart.
I don't look like my mom, I'm what I am.
I don't know what your kid is.
Go to bed.
Let go!
She'd better get over the desk.
Whatever you do, I'm not gonna call you.
When did you buy this?
I was upset.
You know how to sit down.
Why did you take this bitch?
It's cold at home.
Tomit needs surgery.
Tom broke out of France in the past.
This decision is expected to be born soon.
Tommy said it was great.
I've got a good time for the delay.
I have to do something.
He gave me a lot of books.
Mary ate a simple meal.
She's in my office soon.
Even the two parts of the cells look better than 24 points with Georgia's font.
The kid can count to the flesh.
All had to write a report about what they saw.
We're all making mistakes.
Jesus, are you giving?
Allergic to any medicine?
He needs it.
There's a great time today in Boston.
Where's the rest of our class?
I'm done.
I gave the name Kamu and Tominak.
I'm down on the roof.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Let's do this again sometime!
Sami took a bitch.

The roses are opening with a roof.
Which one's cheaper?

Do you know the name of the leader?
Where's the fault?
I gave Tom what he wanted.
It's gone for everyone.
It was very interesting, wasn't it?
You don't know the rules?
That hurts!
I want to live in Brazil.
Tom's very nice.
Why would I let this happen?
A fifth star was the picture that the kid put on the paper.
We had an affair with him for the house.
Come with me to Boston!
Call me if you can.
That's not my problem.
They were in the mountains under their feet.
I came to Mexico on a beautiful May day.
I'll kill you.
Let's go get some rest.
That would have been better if it had already been arranged.
I'll be up at seven o'clock in the morning.
What if I don't tell you?
I'm asking you to come home.
I live in Tokyo.
How did you sleep?
I'll eat when I get home.
They're actually innocent.
Shut up!
It'll be dangerous.
Tom's fighting now, right?
We don't have any more money.
What else can I do?
Everything's constantly changing.
Tom's car was last seen in the neighborhood before his wife killed him.
I'm not working tomorrow.
I'm not kidding.
I'll get a doctor.
You need to read the box if you want to be a member of the choir.

It's been scheduled for a month.
I'm willing to pay anyway.
My mom used to get up early.
They offered coffee to the guests.
Tom's always sleeping.
I'm unstoppable.
When was the last time you did this?
Do they want to share it?
Further delays are possible.
This is a bad place.
How much was Tom involved?
This is my monkey role in a monkey market in Ryogoku.
Tom was on the phone.
The world has changed a lot in the past three years.
Do you hear me now?
They didn't have anything.
The experience is the name that everyone gives to their complaints.
Tom is very focused.
I could have stopped Tom, but I didn't.
That's how I like it better.
Tommy got into a bar.
He made a confession for me.
Try it.
Tom's got a bit of a fever.
Tommy can do this faster than I can.
Tom couldn't afford to vote for him.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
They're looking for the house.
The element has been removed.
Tom's father was a bookmaker.
Tom didn't.
What's wrong?
You'll be better.
Tommy's still in charge of simple mathematical works.
I don't want you to be here.
You're too busy.
I needed a scene.
I'm not sure I know what it means.
Tommy found a whole bond of money.
If you offer your life with lemons, make your lemonade.
Little hands.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Has anyone been hurt?
He's been there for a long time, but finally he's been able to find it.
Tommy took a whole glass of savanna.
I met Tommy tonight.
She'll be a good wife.
We understand each other very well.
I'm confused.
Kim's in love with me.
Tom was very aggressive.
I don't have a vodka.
Tavaly was born.
The rescue aircraft was set up in Tokyo.

You want to pull my brains up?
Don't be scared!
Now live here.
You know that.
On the beach, the tourists stared.
My mother-in-law is the best gift I've ever received from my mother.
Tom gave me a very royal gift.
Do you have a generator?
I was the only one who didn't call it.
What are we doing?
I know one.
I have my wife and my children.
Mari's black.
This is yours.
Take it away.
It's not likely anything serious will happen.
Come on.
Everyone hates Tom.
Tom seems to be very curious about something.
I have to take action in an emergency.
If you eat too much, you'll be fat.
I don't want to see Tomit unharmed.
How can they be?
I don't really need the money.
Tony's got a nice voice.
Tommy didn't do anything wrong.
That's it.
You're a fish.
I've rethinked.
What kind of gym are you going to?
What do you learn?
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you.
I'll find your queen.
He didn't want to be the boss.
Tom and Mary are in the same gang.
It's not a woman's job.
He slept on the bus back, back home.
Do we have to go there?
I think it'd be better if you left now.
You must be Tom's brother.
He's sick.
I've just finished the show.
We're very proud of you.
If you had accepted my advice, you wouldn't have been in the gym right now.
You can go now.
You know almost everything about me.
When he came home, I was watching TV.
I know you're reading.
It's been three hours.
He suggested you don't go.
I got an electric car.
That's weird.
He gave me some good advice.
It's my intention to get out of the company.
I'd like you to come to the meeting.
Thank you very much.
What was your flight?
No one understood me.
I'll stop.
Despite my apology, I'm still angry.
Maybe he's thinking about himself.
Tom asked Mary to take John to the airport.
I forgot to cut the flowers.
She lived in a house in the middle of the forest for a month.
It's not important to get pregnant.
What do I say to Tominak?
I can't take this pain anymore.
Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands.
Opinions combine or divide people.
This question is easy to answer.
Why is Tom doing this?
This car is bigger than that.
They've spent the rest of their lives in their room.
I'm still drinking.
Tom didn't strengthen me, or he didn't accept the beatings.
I understand why Tom is afraid of that.
What's wrong?
Where's the judge?
He's got a measure of regret.
Tom's apartment is small, but very small.
I don't know anything except what you told me.
We have to do something.
It's over.
He's opening up a backup account.
We've never lost.
They didn't report a lot of help.
How much is this room worth?
Tommy took the kid to the movie.
It's so good to stay here!
Try to imagine your situation.
I forgot my name.
Tom's drunk.
This is the situation.
Even those words will disappear once.
I'm fine, thank you.
How old is your daughter?
Very, very remote.
How many hot things have you got today?
I appreciate your cooperation.
One day we all have to die.
Maria calls her children her own.
It's not a real word.
It's a witch.
Why do you always have to resist me?
They lived in Algeria for more than a year.
I think Tommy can't answer it.
A ship suddenly appeared from the shore.
They don't have rules.
Is there something you'd rather like?
He's got his own value.
If you don't like it, don't touch it.
The two boys were smiling at each other.
You still have to learn a lot about how to be nice.
What did you ask?
Without the Day, we wouldn't be able to live on Earth.
It happened immediately.
Everyone knows the law.
I bought you red roses.
We walked around the wall.
I want to live in Boston for the rest of my life.
Happiness plays an important role in life.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since they broke up.
He asked for help.
You know I love Tom, right?
It doesn't always end until we're out of it.
Tom wants to do it.
I want a good day.
I left my horse.
I belong to Tom.
Tommy looked at the dog.
I don't understand how I do it.
He's broke a window.
He's going with my sister.
I'll buy every morning.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It's not a secret.
Tom's got a problem.
Tom asked to see what was going on.
Don't touch me!
Tom is my bookmaker.
He killed your cat.
I'll pray for Tommy.
It wasn't easy for me.
It was finally quiet.
Watch out, don't eat.
He's grown up and has become a big talker.
It's a terrible plan.
I feel so much for you.
That's what you need.
There's nothing special about it.
Don't worry about my mom's clothes today.
All I have to do is look at the food, and I'll get the rest of it.
Who are those guys?
I'm sure he'll be fine with my grandmother.
We've got our dad!
I was too serious.
Look what you're saying.
Let's examine the case.
I'd like a Vanilla funeral.
Tommy's gonna be in a hurry.
Except for days of rain, I'll go to the office on my way.
The dead bastard gave a terrible vision under the bridge.
Tom was obviously unhappy.
The liver for milk.
Tom wants Mari to be happy.
They named their sons Janos.
Tommy wanted Mari to answer her some questions from the past.
Have you ever been to your hairdresser?
What do you think he'll do?
It was good.
He forgot his return.
Don't be surprised, things will work out.
True friendship is more rare than magic.
I know why Tomit was killed.
You're probably hungry.
A temporary landing can take place on a pilot's life.
I have to go to the office.
How'd the test go?
Let's not go back to the guest.
Do you have a boyfriend?
I saw your name on the list.
I love to speak Spanish.
You didn't have the right to do this.
It's a very easy task for him.
He didn't like my answer.
Tommy's got a piece of shit out of his pocket.
Tom's advice isn't too good.
You took a little weight, didn't you?
Did Tom tell you how he did it?
I'll be there for the girl.
Maria accepted the offer.
The plant needs rain.
Tom, can I get this?
What do I say to Tominak?
English is taught in most countries.
Whatever you say, don't lose your head.
The conversation was secreted and used as evidence.
Doctors don't know what's wrong with Tam√°s.

If I could, I'd read it all the time.
We only know a few details about my world.
It's good in the jacket too.
Tom died of a stroke.
Tom doesn't want to.
It was a friend's wedding.
Get out of here!
Tom's injuries aren't serious.
Is there enough time?
They're angry.
Mary's less active than her sister.
Don't come in!
I couldn't stop crying.
Tom's probably still excited.
That's what makes you change your life for all of us.
My father died five years ago.
Why did you ask?
Tom advised Mary not to ask too much money from John.
Not as protective as it sounds.
Call the security service.
My dad suggested we go to the music this afternoon.
You know where I live.
The cat has two kids.
You want to see a French movie, right?
Everyone's worried.
These boys' cousins are like two eggs.
They ate one.
Your name doesn't matter.
It's made of the piano player.
They've changed a lot.

We're not kids anymore.
We've been through a number of rivers.
I was nervous.
I've had a Christmas party with Tommy.
How's your sister?
They need food and water.
It's an important victory.
There's something to eat.
Thank you, Betty, but she didn't take anything.
Tom's gone.
They chose us.
I have nothing to do with the past, not the future.
When you're good enough to join the group, we'll let you go.
I want a new dog.
I'm just speaking French.
It's so sweet, like I'm getting out of smoke.
When did you get here?
I'm not mad at you.
I'm glad I did.
Don't be afraid of the unexpected, but be prepared for it.
Tom doesn't need anyone.
I want to know what's going on here.

He's a great cook.
The room is at the end of the process.
Do I understand?
It's from the BLT room, salad and paradise.

It's important.
I want to leave for the president's honour.
Did you speak French at home?
I'm more than that.
Where did you come from, sir?
Dick promised he'd be back in three hours.
Think about what you want, because you can be real.
What kind of medicine is this?
You wouldn't be right, but I know you're right.
Tomo's life has taken over.
We're here, no!
Change is inevitable.
Tom's late.
Unfortunately, my husband doesn't belong in the fields I know.
I didn't take it completely.
He went to check out his parents.
I'm sure you understand.
My dad wants me to join Tom.
I'm a regular Muslim and I don't smoke.

What's your family status?
I think you should go in private.
I'm not even sure I want to see that movie.
Tom's been here a few days later.
He didn't want to hurt me.
Who should I talk to?
He's a dog.

You look like someone else.
I'm aware of your risks.
How do kids communicate with their parents?
I asked my son what he really wanted.
It's easy to argue.
I love the foci.
I have a suggestion.
Tom stopped me from doing what I wanted to do.
They have children.
We live on this long road.
I don't care about my share.
I'm sorry, but we didn't do this.
Show your mouth.
Look behind you.
One of Tom's friends stole his identity.
Why do you want to be pregnant?
Don't bother them, and they won't bother you.

It's just gonna be a chance, so don't worry about it.

This is my life!
Looks like nobody noticed anything.
Maybe Tom will never leave.
That's terrible.
I don't want to get up!

He dances on the two sides.
It didn't hurt.
It should never have happened.

The decision was canceled.
I'm writing a competition for free time.
I should have followed your advice.
There's no one in life.

He studied the original text of War and Peace.
I live in New Zealand.
How did you like my dinner you ate last night?

It happens too often.
I've got one in front of my house.
I'll go back to my chair.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
In this box there are more tastes than in the other.
Can I pay for the check?

This is the best book I've ever read.

Who painted these pictures?
These oranges are broken.
I'm making tea in my coffee.
Tommy says he doesn't want to wait for you.
Would you like to visit Chichen Itz√°?
It's my budget.
I love music, too.
I want to do well.
Tom's doing well at school.
They're our good friends.
Tom didn't know what to answer.
Don't be less satisfied.
When he comes, let's start.
Why are these girls so tough?
I still need to get up in the morning.
Mom was very scared of the baby's cooking.
Don't you want to think about yourself?
He's totally gay.
That's a big mistake.
Both of us have the same problem.
Tom is constantly against himself.
Mom, look!
I really agree with Tommy.
That's a good idea.
I'm going to Boston by car.
If you think about yourself, you know where to find it.
I don't like dogs.
We just ate.
Yeah, he's urgent.
There's a right in the fridge.
There's no reason for that.
Do you have a volunteer?
It's not enough in the desert.
They're listening.
God helps us.
Remember him.
Name's really good for you.
Would you answer that question, please, where did you put the key?
I'll get it.
We'll be there.
It's the group leader.
That's what I want.
I need to defeat Tom.
I don't think they like it.
Tommy's really excited about the inside.
From the beginning, I didn't intend to live in a big city.
Tom's got the keys.
Tom's always fucking leaving his girlfriend.
I can't just leave.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That day my life changed.
People are part of nature?
You need to be careful.
You know I don't like tobacco.
I wish I could be a car.
Tommy couldn't help Mari.
Do you know the name of Tommy's family?
I tried to catch up with the cheerleader.
My wife's family is very rich.
Tell Tomina I'm coming back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the pot.
Tom, open the door!
The boy's got a knife in his hand, he's got a sword in his hand.
I want to go there.
I would like to thank you for your great work.
Let's hope not.
I've learned a lot about French.
Tom won't believe a word you're telling him.
Tommy's got five in the study.
Tommy's word is against Mari's word.
Now I don't have time to talk.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
They're having coffee at home.
You can't buy respect.
Tom's gone.
Tom's saved.
You never should've left before.
This book is used in Spanish.
Health is more important than economy.
That's what Tom told me.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking about Tom.
I think every single person should have a diet.
What do we do first?
I don't know, I'll call and ask.
Could you suggest another date?
I gave it up too soon.
What are you gonna do there?
That's totally normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Tommy's been away for about three minutes.
All right.
Let's try it.
Tom insisted that he pay for his dinner.
Take a cake of bread.
I need an egg.
Samuel hates it.
I like to travel alone.
We don't want that.
My guitar is in the trunk of the car.
We're sitting there.
He dropped the glass and broke it.
Everyone's scared.
That's right.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not perfect.
The former hunters had left the place illegally.
Kiss me.
His idea is completely remote from reality.
Some people look like others just because they have less money.
The bastard attacked the poor girl.
Tom didn't show too much interest.
Your job is over.
I want to pay for it now.
I'd like to ask you something.
I answered the question.
Maria solved the mystery.
Do you have any water?
How can I stop Tom?
Tom is here right now.
I usually eat at home with my family.
That shouldn't have happened.
We can't prove anything.
You'll be able to fight in that fight.
Tom was involved, so Mary got home with the car.
I don't speak English.
Tom's party was a great success.
Tom was a cop.
We've seen a castle before us.
Did you see Tomit when you were watching?
Tommy seemed surprised.
I'm usually going to swim in the river.
Don't deal with them!
I'm sorry I went to Australia.
They do the same things as I did as a child.
That's great!
I'm out of the living room.
Mary's gone to the gym.
The report was prepared for the purpose of preparing, and there was a lack of settlement.
Tom is neither rich nor famous.
Everybody's gone crazy.
Tom's on the criminal record.
I'm coming to Boston tomorrow night.
He called me personally.
I have to go.
I'll look after some food.
He can't stop.
I've learned so much about Tom.
That's when I need a job.
Everyone's still sleeping.
Dogfighting.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very nice.
I'm sick, too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit back!
I don't know where I am.
Tom didn't do anything.
He's very proud of his ability.
You've lived in a remote area?
All roads were set up on the plane.
It needs a red toll.
He didn't know what to do with the problem.
I'm sad now.
My dad's on his way to work.
Where's Tommy?
Don't be so sensitive.
I'm five miles away today.
I never understood Tom.
We had to be there.
Tom made breakfast.
She's the most important student in the class.
You should have called the cops.
I'll keep it secret.
Tom hasn't escaped in September yet.
You gave up your coffee.
I couldn't have done it better myself.
Tom has been a member of this club for three years.
In my career, I'm so small that I can't make it.
Go home quickly.
I'm not an Italian.
You found my cat.
I thought Tom was coming.
Whoever loves flowers can't be a bad man.
Einstein says everything's positive.
The old book was fine.
They're just grown up.
Around as tall as you.
Tom's right.
It's important that we help them get into trouble.
Old dog, you can't teach new tricks anymore.
I have to let the fire go.
I love your language.
I understand what you're thinking.
They're busy.
Tell her you love her before it's too late.
Would you lend me the book if you had finished it?
That's what I told you.
Catastrophe accidents at the workplace.
What do you think of my idea?
Give me a little time to figure out what happened.
Tom's not afraid of death.
There's not enough information.
There's a field in my house.
The bus also started.
There's the biggest lake in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Anyway, who's gonna have to wait for the line...
I don't know how to break it.
Tom looked at his teeth.
The rain's getting smaller.
Tom's doing that to everyone.
Are you coming in?
We'll change this soon.
I don't want to talk about time.
My request was rejected.
We were surprised to hear the news.
Don't underestimate yourself.
I'm Antonio.
I met my friend here.
I traveled all over Russia.
I want to get Tom out of here.
Tommy and my son.
He's a stranger.
You can't know the truth.
Tom is also raising the lightest critical note.
Believe it or not, that's the truth.
I went without it.
He loves his brother.
Where else should we go?
If you don't like it, you can go.
Tom's gonna pay.
I see.
Tom was just missing.
I don't want to see him.
You need to get out of here if you want to eat anything.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work every Sunday?
We've made it feel good.
We haven't had a problem yet.
What color is your hair?
In the room where you're sitting, I was sitting yesterday.
You're not good-looking.
I hope Tommy will understand.
Do you think in your mind?
I thought I could trust you.
The sound's gone up.
Co-operation is for the brains.
The moon entered the whole city during one night.
I'll explain later.
Honestly, I don't care.
The truth is the best ruling year.
Tom's gone?
They called the animal doctor because there was no other doctor in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him touch you!
Take care of yourself!
Are you working tonight?
How many of your pockets?
The uncle's hand was tied to the final students.
I live in Milan.
Tom can come any time.
I think time will solve this problem.
Why did your pool go together?
I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
Tom's Christian?
Ask Tama to explain it.
You did it together.
I slept in the open window because of the heat.
He's got a mistake on the day.
She lost her sister again.
Let's go to the movie.
I want to fight you!
A nation killed a Jew.
We don't know exactly.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
We learned a lot about France instead.
That's great!
Is that what everyone wants?
Are you messing with me?
You can't believe a word.
I love Spanish!
I'm going to walk one so I can cut my head off.
A little work doesn't hurt anybody.
A chain as strong as the most common eye.
You used to call me.
I'm going to report to the worker today.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
My father traveled to Greece.
That's enough of my brain knowledge.
The king has destroyed his enemies.
You're talking!
I want Mary to let Tomit finish it.
I'm tired.
We have a big problem.
You're too involved in driving.
His eyes were cut off from the tears.
You're going there without me.
Tom's gonna laugh.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about that.
Take it, please.
We'll do it together.
I missed you, could you help me, please?
He saw Tommy M√°ria smile.
Seven to reach the eight-hour clock.
They considered him a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you, too.
I'm just asking for a few seconds.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tomina's alive to see.
He promised me he'd come to four.
I don't want to lose this game.
Take over the education system.
They're there.
Hello.
Tom took a teaspoon.
I don't like to get up.
Tamak thought she had material problems.
When I hear the news, I'll be a lesbian.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Why do we deal with what happens after our death?
We need to help each other.
Sometimes my dream comes true.
He moved all the money I gave him.
I thought we were neighbors.
You think I should tell Tom?
What does that mean to you?
You know how to do this?
I'm a doctor.
How old is yours?
I don't have any confidence.
Who loves Tomit?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm dying.
What's up?
Tom's got a carrot on his eyes.
We're thieves.
You're easier than you think.
Did you see my camera?
Tom did a lot of great things.
I was really busy.
It's all right.
Don't be shy anymore.
You're gonna pay for it.
It would be good if we had a collection of the last words of famous people.
I'm a social worker.
The arrest was amazing.
I believe your words.
Different?
Tom's got as many services as he needs.
Tom wants to be successful.
Nothing happened.
You were in the library yesterday?
I love her better.
He signed ten books, but he didn't tell any of them.
Tom's home with his parents.
I don't really want to eat now.
Tom was satisfied with his success.
They didn't find anyone.
You can do this for yourself.
You don't take much time.
I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you look into his gallery?
At first, I was nervous, but then I calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
First, you have to ask Tom.
Explain to me.
I'm clean with the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
He's buried somewhere in the mountains.
Tom's gone straight.
Tom took you to his cat's back.
I feel something terrible is going to happen.
Is that it?
Tom's not married.
No one's there.
We've been in trouble.
Tom was jealous of Mari.
I didn't think you were speaking French.
I had two dogs.
They're absolutely different from me.
We can't save everyone.
Tom's down.
Where's the bed when there's no rain?
This is one of the best places in town.
I just need a road repair.
Tom should have been a dancer.
I left it out of my mind.
The gas dropped, the rain poured down the river.
You look very tired.
Bring him in.
I'll help Tam√°s.
I've been looking for a lot of money in my life.
I'm gonna tell Tom what to tell Marine.
I haven't eaten yet.
I accept your terms.
I'm a good guy.
It's dangerous!
Can I open my eyes?
The car's blue.
I was sick, I stayed home all day.
He was born in Boston.
Can you wait a minute?
The ponies have eight feet.
I'm still a kid.
Tom's looking at women.
That's stupid.
I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That'll be enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I'm done with it.
I'm gonna give you the message, Tom.
Mari was too sensitive to express her feelings.
Tom should've done a lot better.
What miracles were they singing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Already, or not?
Mr. Harrison was in a coma on his stomach, and he had a heart attack.
I don't like learning French today.
Tom's very rare.
Let's go, but without me.
I was crazy to trust Tom.
What kind of beer is it?
That was a secret.
I trust you.
It's good to see you starved.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents don't live anymore.
Not all black and white.
You have no right to judge these people.
He's obviously excavated.
Tom and Mary made the same arrangements.
Let's discuss this.
Aren't you going to buy with me?
The water's not healthy.
Can you break up with a finger?
Tom has a brother.
He's here to protect you.
Looks like Tom was very worried.
Tomina's got blood on her chest.
There's a book on the table.
It's important that we promote our language in every way possible.
When's the next time?
I guess I didn't understand him.
Anytime, you can ask me anything.
I love you.
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home right now.
It's just an empty threat.
There are two old guests in front of our house.
I'm sick of it.
The crowds are stuck in long, dry hair.
They don't know anybody in the picture.
I hope we don't cause you discomfort.
Let's get this out of here.
You're learning some chemistry.
He's keeping his word.
I don't count on any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't make enough sugar in his coffee.
I'm sure I won't go through tomorrow's investigation.
The word is okay.
The new building has arrived today.
Lora!
I've never seen that before in my life.
I'll call Tomit right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
I hope things will be okay.
Paul's an hour straight.
You replaced the boat with Margarin.
It was popular in the nineties.
Everyone did it.
People like gold in the water?
I live in a small house, not too far from here.
Tom's in trouble.
I'm sorry, can I help you?
The paragraph that the teacher asked Sarah to read was not interesting.
Tommy and Mari are both good teachers.
Tom gave Mari his number.
I live with Rod Johnal.
The air is very hot.
There's no money that could be sold.
Tom would've walked.
Tell Tom to meet us at the station.
It's a good idea.
I'm glad to see you again.
Tom was a good worker.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, some of them get back to their rights.
I just need a little encouragement.
Dani knew Linda was gone.
I'm not the man I've ever been.
I'm not a Catholic.
Let's stay here.
We've lost our money.
I don't want to walk with you.
I don't understand anything.
What's the price for this jacket?
I came from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more space.
Tom taught me most of what I know in French.
Can we drink something?
He's keeping his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard for everyone to get into love.
There's a solution.
What do you think Tom's looking for?
Well, it's not like that.
This world is dominated by evil forces.
He called me to throw my fear away.
I'm on my way.
Can I have a pound of detached tonne?
Don't hang up.
The story was real.
The wound has been removed from the pain after the emotional effect has passed.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Concentrate!
They don't talk at all.
Get off me!
He's always asking for your opinion.
We're using a margarin instead.
I'm very pleased with this crime.
When both do the same, it's not the same anymore.
I'm not the one with Tom's problem.
How much money is Tom gonna get?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Serbia's border with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
You can even follow his advice.
My name is Ricardo, is it yours?
Maria's talking in a dream.
I don't think that's ever gonna happen again.
This is you, Tom!
Give me another beer.
My shoes are stuck in the motorbike.
What's the taste of the breakfast?
He's speaking French.
I'm up.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain it.
Tom went to rest a few years ago.
We're all safe.
I'm sure.
Calm down!
Two wines went out.
Come tomorrow!
Can we try this?
The table's green.
Tom had to win the competition.
I need you to be a superhero.
I'm still not there to obey.
I don't want to know.
The race often gives us what we don't expect.
What's the recipe?
We're competitive.
Give me a painkiller, please.
You're completely wrong.
He was very scared, so he didn't come to school today.
Something's wrong.
They're gonna talk tomorrow.
This table is the top of the table.
Open up!
Do you understand English?
She had to see her birthday.
Tom took part in an office.
Do you feel bad?
It's hard to steal a towel.
Tomit can never get out of the basement.
Tell me, where's the police?
He was so tired, he was asleep.
I hope I'll start learning your beautiful language in the near future.
Tom was so paranoid.
I need numbers.
I count to three.
Don't talk.
Tommy didn't even know how to thank France for something.
Where's the next medicine?
I sang.
Tom and Mari are different, like fire and water.
Tommy's a good reporter.
We have less than three hours.
Tom's parents were believers.
It's a mistake.
This car looks like mine.
What a fool you are!
Maybe it's understandable to me, but not to me.
Don't try to be late.
No one knows everything.
He's a bus driver.
Don't eat.
But that's not the real problem.
What's the name of the book?
Tom loved me.
Are you telling the truth to us?
Russia is big.
Who's the woman who's there?
Tom said he'd hit you.
Tom was the most influential man in town.
I'm just waiting for you to get married.
Is there cold in Germany?
Leave my camera alone.
You have to be crazy.
Don't ask her to help you more.
I'm not coming.
Thank you.
Let's get a girlfriend in there.
It's not an ivy.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
Please, tell me more.
He has to keep his eyes open.
Tomina's got a black cat.
Courage comes from courage and trust friendship.
It's back in history.
Tom bought Mary a box of cookies.
My fate is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.
The lamp came out, and we stayed in the dark.
I'm planning to rent my room.
The hole stopped, and it wasn't gonna go any further.
He accused them of stealing.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I've decided to join the volunteer firefighters.
Tom stopped, but then he stopped again.
I love his throne.
I wouldn't go out today.
That woman's present's wife.
He's got the letter.
I feel much better today.
That's exactly what happened.
You can't do anything wrong by learning a language.
Shut up, or I'll get out of here.
Is everything ready?
I have to go.
I don't steal.
Nothing proves their existence.
The mathematicians have only to prove what our imagination has created.
I'm a co-operative.
He was afraid of the mess.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
Good morning, honey.
What do you think of modern art?
It's not Tom's name.
It's hot today.
He's the oldest boy in our class.
Tom's in the room, right?
Rome didn't build it in one day.
How old were you when you started learning French?
What happened to the money?
We need to protect ourselves from all attempts to lose our freedom.
You've got ten of them in the house.
What did you do last night?
We're a tree.
Tom's intentions were not clear.
Do you have my book?
Please, think about it.
Tom did what he liked.
I see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't get me back here together.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
It's green.
You can't always win.
It's an understanding.
I can't feel myself.
God be with you!
I'm out of here.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
The road is full of cats.
What does the news say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If the time allows, let's go pee.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Who are these songs?
I'm sure I'm going to make this tennis match.
I went to Boston.
You're one of us.
It's amazing what I've learned.
They've got two sides of your line.
We're boys.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Would you give me an example of this?
I have to give you a message.
He said he didn't know.
It's worse than we thought.
You know my secret.
He's got his tattoos removed.
I swear I'm gonna hurt you.
He told the boys to pull the trigger.
We have twelve children.
It's my wish to read the dreams.
You'll get used to it soon.
I don't know why Tommy went to the hospital.
The prices are down.
I'm not sorry if you have to wait.
We helped each other.
That was when he was out.
Tom painted the door in green.
Just start working.
I'm sure I'll hear it.
Tom took Mary's car.
Let's see.
You're the most important person in my life.
But the proposed changes were against each other.
I sat down with this tree.
Tom's released.
Can I have the full name?
Uncsi!
I'll tell him what to say.
I told you this wouldn't be good.
Tom gave Mary a kiss.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your travel card.
I saw one.
What's your professional?
Chief Tom Mary.
Small or not, there's no way to find real couples.
They left Tom in Cser.
Nice to meet you.
Tommy didn't understand one thing with Mari.
I want a smile on your mouth.
Is that a snake?
I found Tom and Mary.
Is that a joke?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
I'm having a bad day.
All right, people, let's go!
Tom went on a trip with his friends.
I heard Tommy and Mari get married in October.
The white needle is as hard as the white one.
You must be here.
Is that where you can drive?
I don't think this guy's comfortable.
Tommy's got water for the tea.
Tom tried to reduce his costs.
Tommy got the dog to sit down.
Don't you think Tommy's never coming back?
Because you know her.
They don't want to talk to you.
Tominak may need it.
He's like a king to me.
You're looking good.
I came from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom's good for the animals.
I didn't register.
The salt you put in the air, white, not pink.
I'm always looking after you.
Tom started to recover.
I'll work every day.
You look hot.
We've got to stop him now.
Do you really believe in the miracle?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm afraid of Tomit.
I'm glad we agreed on something.
And then the bear went down to the branch, and poured out a bowl of butter and touched it with the vermin that the basket gave him. For a while the skin changed into a beautiful, semi-smoothed ball, and the taliska turned to the back, which led to two dancing pairs.
Don't make a mistake.
Don't you feel it now?
The books sacrifice their time.
Is he tall?
I'll wait for Tomira.
I heard you're not going home.
I'm dying for your complaints.
I was born this morning.
The police found a dead body in an uncharted car near the park.
I'm sure he can do it.
Our day is in the middle of the day.
You're done?
She's been working all her life.
We spent 15 miles that day.
Tom can't make him accept a babysitter.
Hurry up!
I washed my hair last night.
I'm finally sleeping.
Cathy stopped the flowering.
The number of traffic accidents is increasing from year to year.
Start living.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
He was following the murder of the man.
Many will die.
The next case comes to the 2nd floor and goes to Shibuya at 4:35.
You did?
What are they doing there?
Are you asking for some tea?
Is there anything else about this?
I can't find my other treasure.
Tom's sharing.
Women are taking care of the patient at night.
People don't look special today when a man grows his hair a long time ago.
A boy made my wallet when I was sitting next to him on his lap.
Who do you trust?
Here's my e-mail address.
Could you help me get a taxi?
Tominak was an alibi.
I know whether he's an enemy or not.
Can I do something for you?
You know the whole city.
Someone beat me.
Mary's not that pretty.
There were a couple of Tintafoules in the bookstore.
Who wants to go.
Tom's lack of flexibility.
I'm going to Australia tomorrow.
You Japanese?
He was a poor musician.
The animals are our friends.
I don't like such surprises.
He was a mean man.
It's an opportunity.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.
I saw him with my own eyes, and I heard him with my own mind.
Would you excuse us for just a second, please?

Now I'm on the line.
What caused the accident?
It's the queen's dream.
I don't think it's a good place to go.
I'm a cop.
Let's see how he's going.
I'm Tom, and I'm dependent.
Tom wanted to be good.
The best shoes are gay.
Can you explain the difference between black and green tea?
We need guidance.
That's what I've been doing all day.
Anyone who wants to see the hostages has to wear the reindeer.
I don't want meat.
What's more worth, time or money?
The world of the moon has fallen on the top of the sky.
Money-saving.
That's not real right now.
Don't be afraid.
He forgot his non-infection.
What's the problem?
I need blood.
Why did they kill Tomit?
It's pretty simple.
Aren't you ready?
Well, when I was ready to call, a letter came from him.
Titok?
Tom is a very serious friend of mine.
I don't even like him if he does.
He always asks the opinions.
Maria is our youngest daughter.
Jim loves his girlfriend very much.
I want a lawyer.
He's doing something on his own.
He's practicing torture right now.
We'll protect you.
I want my beer password back, and now.
Be a good boy.
He got hurt in a car accident.
What happened to you?
Let's drink another beer.
I brought you today, but you weren't home.
I'll inform Tomit.
You're better than me.
You're kidding, aren't you?
I'm going home.
He doesn't speak English at all.
You know what's gonna happen?
He kept it secret that he took a bike to his son.
I'm sorry I haven't written that long.
I've been sick already.
Tom has no right to our family alone.
How far is it?
You're starting to capsize.
Cover the world.
We have visitors.
Where's your gun?
He wants to know everything about you.
Why do the walls come suddenly to the front of the tower?
Why are you speaking French?
Before I go home, I'm drinking a couple of drinks.
They live near the cave.
I have two positions.
Tom and Mary were proposed.
He's gone.
I don't understand his thinking methods.
That's why people get so drunk.
Tom used to call Mary a joke.
Drop the gun!
Who's this list?
I wasn't wrong.
You remember me.
They didn't believe me.
How many rooms do you have in your house?
I speak Spanish.
Why didn't you call me before you came?
He was less interesting than I thought he was.
This bank always keeps its own interests in mind.
When do you celebrate Christmas?
Feel at home.

It's either Tom or John.
What's your name?
The cat's dead while the dolphin's gone.
How much are the oranges coming in?
Can anyone confirm this?
He doesn't sleep at night because he's trying to save his weak business.
Not a word!
Do you know why God is angry?
I know how to use re-rehabilitation.
Layla got a text message from Sami.
It's a problem.
The boys will be happy.
I'm not doing it for the money.
Tom didn't understand one with Mary.
It could be expensive.
I hope so.
I like the album very much.
I don't know any of them.
It's closed.
Did you hear about yesterday's fire?
I know what I did.
I think you're already packed and ready for launch.
It's hard to believe that it's all clear and timeless.
Most people are very upset when they have to talk before the public.
Shoot!
When did you work in Boston?
No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
Let's go into the classroom.
Tom's kind.
There are people who can easily be affected.
I don't understand why I can't do that.
It's not a bad idea.
Which direction are you going?
Tom's listening.
There's no evidence.
I think you're gonna be okay.
There's no one there.
We're going back to our old kids.
Can I sing?
I'm coming to help you.
He came to Tokyo in his early teens.
I don't like the moon.
What's the question?
The dead man is immortal.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden.
There's a phone in my room.
They're up looking for gold.
Everyone's alive.
John started the car.
Please explain.
Who's taking care of the kids?
This room is cold.
All the students went home.
You know enough.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Business is business.
You'd better talk to your mom.
We're not so stupid.
The kiwi-circuit is a sizeless snake.
You can bring water to the hole, but you can't drink it.
When does the music start?
He won't take anything in his life.
I'll find your way of thinking.
People believe in God.
Tom and Mary didn't try to be too loud.
Look what you did to me.
That's the lady's guide.
You're bad.
Tom's the best boy in school.
When were you the best?
That's my favorite painting.
You're going to make it right now.
I'm in a hole.
Is this going to affect me?
I'm always drinking two cups of coffee in the morning.
I grabbed Tom from his books.
I don't know where Tom's sister is.
It's the last salamander.
I've been running the whole thing this morning.
That was great.
Maybe I'll drink later if I'm very hungry.
Is there anything between you guys?
Don't ask why, just do it.
My dream is that I'll be a teacher.
It's very nice of you.
How many hours did you take to breakfast?
Give me this flower.
Something had to happen to be this.
We're going to get to our pictures.
Don't stay long.
Oh, no!
I'd rather go there on a bike than I do.
Tam√°s and Maria said they don't like dogs.
Tom made a lot of progress this week.
Are you really sending me a Japanese baby?
I'm not in Australia with Tommy.
We'll wait.
I didn't mean to tell you that.
Just read a book.
He's too much.
As far as I know, he never made such a mistake.
I'll take the car.
We're not living together.
You're sick.
They'd like to.
They're not gonna make it.
I helped Tommy.
There's a table made of wood.
We lost.
The cat's lovely.
How's everybody doing?
If it really looks like that, maybe it's time for you to get out.
Can you forgive me?
Who's left?
I want to learn French later.
I'm very busy with kids.
Tom's 13 years old, but he still believes in Mikulas.
Why don't you sleep yet?
I hope I can see him again.
Tom made us all crazy.
It's a bivalve story and a Russian hero's courage.
It worked well.
There are more houses behind the houses.
The sea was full of lemons.
The superpower has gone into the ocean and filled it.
Please don't go away.
Tom can't stop.
It was my fault.
Is that dangerous?
Tom's gonna take Mari to the airport.
He lives in another state.
I'm working to live, but I'm not working to do it.
Stay right there.
He knows everything about the upbringing.
I gave my dad a ring ring for a present.
Tommy used to call Mari?
He was self-recorded.
Tom knew everything.
Come with me.
I can't forgive you.
I think you called a bad number.
My mom got out of the kitchen.
The movie's unalmal.
Tell me what answer?
Let's talk about them.
Tommy told them to sit down.
Tom doesn't like cats.
Write it as soon as possible.
Who's tied up your shoe?
Germany is the best language in the world.
Tom should have been a lawyer.
Actually, she's my sister.
Please fill in this leaflet and wait for our notification.
I'll take you to the station.
Never ask me to help you again!
Where are your kids now?
It's a sense of humor.
I still have plenty of time to play.
You're talking to Tom.
Tell them everything you know.
Of course!
Is there a lift here?
Where am I now?
Tom got sick of eating.
Here's the address.
Tommy's got an accent from Mari.
Mari wasn't married.
She misses one side.
Where can I get my bottle?
A month ago he went to London.
You don't like your friend.
He's not here today.
He took the farmr's daughter as his wife.
I don't want my kids to smoke.
My car is older than I am.
I missed you, didn't I?
The modern man is no longer happy without a car.
Help's on the way.
Use this information well.
I saw something.
Can I make some suggestions?
Mary was looking for you then.
I found a place to live.
Tom, where are you going to make pictures?
I'll get you some noses.
None of us are hungry.
It's not a whole story.
What are these good for?
His parents were outside the city.
And what can you show me about that?
How long has Tam√°s been working here?
That's crazy.
You're telling the truth.
Tommy knows a lot about Mari.
What's the 67's?
They've been kidnapped.
Those girls are very busy.
Are you sure it's okay?
Tom lied to the witness.
I'll read the letters.
We're happy.
Good doesn't mean it's smart.
Tom didn't change it.
I tried to relax.
I can deal with kids.
She's sleeping again.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
We've been over each other.
He's been robbed.
Tom knew about the robbery.
I was there with him.
That's all right.
The old man hit a car.
I'm gonna have to wash my hair.
Caligula was a Roman emperor who listened to the name Incitus, which means "good".
I should never have listened to you.
It's really sad.
We're sick.
They've got their eyes.
That year, my father sat on this tree when I was born.
Let me rest a little.
I don't know much about dogs.
This lady looks very good.
The visitor is my favorite food.
Look at Tomit.
He kept everyone quiet.
What do you want to do with him?
Tommy deleted his Facebook page.
It contains milk, milk, milk and sugar.
I don't like to work; what if we were to go to the movies instead?
You should look at the cake.
That's not how it was.
I need to change.
This mana is quite popular in China.
I'm kidding.
Today, we want our children to make their own decisions, but we expect these decisions to be consistent with us.
I'm dying of ties.
I always knew this day would come.
I'm glad you liked it.
Mari took care of you.
Tom went to rest a few years ago.
It's half an hour.
Red scarf!
It's not working.
A smile?
He hurt her.
Tom's just scared.
They drink too much.
What color is your hair?
Who founded the Google Translator?
Mary asked Tom what his opinion was.
Great.
I doubt you'll remember.
He threw the knife.
You've been married for six months.
Shall I take you somewhere?
Tom sucks.
Tom's birthday.
I killed him in a rage. There was no pre-eminent murder.
We need to count the voting records.
I don't like the cold.
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world.
You're gonna spend the rest of your life here in the moment.
Tom's a retired cop.
They don't know us.
One litre of milk contains about three grams of white.
Don't forget to write to us.
I underestimated Tom.
I don't know for sure.
Life starts when you're ready to live it.
Tom works hard to support his family.
I hope my boss will understand one of his plans.
Can I show you?
All the money was gone.
How nice!
I need to talk to him.
He's mad.
Tom left Mary.
I did it like he didn't understand it.
Good sense of humor helps in difficult situations.
Did you get it?
I'll see you later.
It'll be interesting.
They're gone?
He's got black hair.
Yesterday was a spring, but today it's a lot more.
We need to warn Tom.
Sometimes we'll meet next week.
Stop it.
What operating system are you using?
Did Tom throw it out for the living room?
The hotel is full.
Has anyone been surprised?
Tom's a good teacher.
All right, Tom.
Paraszt!
Where do you come from?
Maria kept her wedding dress herself.
Tom's fine?
He's got his stomach cut off.
Can you imagine the Bible‚Äôs promise of a resurrection?
Someone broke into my house last week.
How often do you lose things?
Do we have papers?
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I'll explain later.
Hold always shows the same page to Earth.
Tommy hasn't gone out all week.
You should've come here earlier.
His words were exactly those.
He looks young.
Don't be too direct.
The dog's chasing the strangers.
I'm sorry.
He's aware of your risks.
Zoknit's gone.
Tom's haemophilia.
You never tell me you love me.
Please, there will be a little more careful in the future.
The Iszonat was stupid, Sami.
He doesn't have a lot of friends.
You're free?
Who betrayed Tomit?
Tom and Mary answered once.
Have you seen Petanque yet?
There's a terrible witch, too.
I'm not here.
I can't follow your logic.
What do you want to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the purpose.
No one was there.
All my questions were answered.
I knew you'd be in trouble.
Tominak's a guest.
I feel a lot of pain in my life.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?
I don't want to sleep.
I don't believe a word from him.
My birthday is November.
Have you behaved well today?
You're crazy!
I worked hard a few months ago.
Tom's sleeping in two sets.
Here you go.
Is that a problem for you?
Why did you take this?
Who wrote this?
He's coming!
I felt pretty lonely.
I'm going to my friend.
Let go of the robbery.
Time is fast enough when you read something.
Tom's thinking fast.
My dream is that I'll be an artist.
I lost my skin.
I like to sleep.
The fruit is in the basket.
I love the sweet pizza.
We think our son is very smart, of course, not only that we're accepted.
We're stuck.
Mary said she wasn't Tom's daughter.
Have you eaten in my restaurant where Tom works?
I hope it works.
I came to bring my dog.
Do you teach French in your schools?
You're poor.
Get yourself up.
I fucked you up, Tom.
He's going to be there.
Where were you when I needed your help?
The coffee's ready.
You just like it because of my black hair?
I must have heard this sound somewhere.
The doctor suggested that she go to the hospital.
I'll be right back.
I'm not well paid.
Why are you working?
My family isn't too big.
Please move forward.
There are more cars on the road than I do.
I hope they're okay.
Tominas should have known this would come to an end.
Tommy's a little overbearing man.
My sister loves Tomit.
It's too late.
- What's going on?
Tom's not mad.
We have to pay the tax.
Tom's on his way to the ground.
They're not responding.
Keep doing what you did.
Here's some.
We'll settle down later.
I'm Israel.
They went into the woods.
How the hell can you expect me to pay for that?
Tom asked Mary where John lives.
If it hadn't been on the map, I'd've lost it.
I think he's coming.
He's in the kitchen tomorrow.
Are you kidding me?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife's gone.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem is.
What did you see?
It's not likely Tom knows where Mari lives.
I'm asking for three orders.
Tom's in his pocket.
I'll wait.
Tom can do it.
No one lives in this house.
What's wrong with the English, no one can touch.
Sponsor him!
You're not gonna die.
What's wrong with you?
My horse is white.
You got it.
We need to be comfortable.
Is the museum open today?
Tom's not because he's on the line.
The wifi doesn't work for me.
I'm tired again.
Do you learn English every day?
Good luck with the competition.
That won't be enough.
Looks like it.
I didn't sleep.
Tommy's request is at least double for mine.
No one sees my ease.
She was born in Mohamed Mekka.
Tom and Maria are deaf.
Tell me the words you don't understand.
Who's the most famous man you know?
I want you to be all right tomorrow at this time.
They ended up in the spring days and replaced them with the cold winter days.
Why me?
I've never thought of that before.
They didn't see anyone.
I'm the boss, aren't I?
My son came to my room.
Tommy doesn't seem happy to see us.
Soon after Tommy died, his wife repatriated.
Tom is the boss.
I didn't do what I had to do.
Do you have Tom's tattoo?
I don't mind asking forgiveness.
Please stay where you are.
I don't travel much.
He remained in France for a while and then went to Italy.
He's always busy.
There's a certain possibility that this will happen in my life.
Tamak loved his job.
Did you find anything?
Stay away from me.
Why didn't Tom send the bus?
It's possible to expand your clothes.
Ten times a day.
It's very white.
You left last night.
We haven't even had a concert in Boston yet.
Tom probably doesn't know why Mary's not here.
Don't worry.
Good people look good, regardless of what they're wearing.
You're comparing the soul with the environment.
Tom's in a chair now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't handle this sound.
I'm so glad we met.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tommy's rich, but Mari's not.
We should probably go.
I love coffee.
You know who Tom is?
I'm willing to buy you.
We're understanding.
Tomorrow will be a new day.
You're keeping us a show.
The world's top problem.
Tom's going to lose.
They play baseball after school.
They're both named.
You've done a perfect job.
He's stuck in the photo.
Tommy wants some books.
There's milk on the day.
What are they gonna do?
Tom led the attack.
Tom never eats a baby at all.
No, it's not my house.
I live in New York.
Our coffee's gone.
Thank you.
What would you do if your child was like that?
My kids don't usually lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
This never ends.
They're both named.
I wish you wouldn't do that now.
I tried to help Tominak.
Your soul is hurt in hell.
I'm pregnant and my head hurts, I think I'm gonna get sick.
I'm starting to get in.
Put this down.
He won his love.
He's got a class.
Is that where you can give me that kiss?
I think Twitter's just a waste of time.
Come on, get it.
Tom asked Mary the same thing I did.
Hold no one.
We were born in this world.
I helped Tomak rehabilitate his Christmas son.
I forgot to make flowers for Evan.
We didn't do it for Tommy.
He could've kissed his kisser, but he didn't, he just forgot.
We're not so poor.
She's working for the payroll, not because she's enjoying it.
I know who hurt him.
I'm dependent.
The star of the tree has reached its end.
He's a good friend.
He made a scientific discovery.
Tom's computer contains hundreds of gypsy hermelin videos.
Why are you so tired today?
My lunch's gone.
How many people do you think we'll call the bridge?
Tominak doesn't have a lot of books.
I have doubts as to whether it's going to work.
Let's get out of here!
There's no sport there like me.
From my phone.
Tom's back at the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What's going on with Tommy?
I feel better every day.
I feel like I'm crazy.
What do the doctors say?
I forgot the name of the leader.
Be nice, help me.
He didn't say anything.
Why are you asking for forgiveness?
Tom's got it cut.
Did you know Tom left the house?
Love the bonds.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dance with other girls.
No one was in the room.
Tom put his girlfriend's photos in the fire.
I'll go and tell everyone.
Go ahead.
You're an expert.
That's a girl I've ever met.
I was on the list.
Give me my book back!
Although we've all done our best, we know we won't win.
He was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
My mother didn't say that.
Tom didn't know his water crew was successful until he got a big water account.
This is our secret.
Why are you unsatisfied?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
There was a fire nearby last night.
It's better if we go, Tom.
It's probably a little sleep for all of you.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't do this.
It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
I'm on the plane.
Are you home?
The tops take the mountain around.
That's what I think.
How can I understand you?
It's in the kitchen.
I should have done it with you.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same again today.
I guess Tam√°s was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who found Tama to help.
Tom's out of here.
One of my bikes is defective.
I'm not used to having dinner with Tam√°s.
It's over, isn't it?
It's been raining for two years.
I'm gonna hold on to it.
This statement has not been translated yet.
Tom's waiting too much.
It's very easy to swallow.
Man's not from my grandmother, except for a few.
We're all right.
Tom wants to learn to laugh.
I've got a hard day today.
Here's your bag.
An intelligent man who discovered something more interesting than sex.
Tom's mosqued everything.
He loved both of them, and they loved him both.
I can't stop calling him.
Try someone else.
Remember what you said.
Take off your hair.
He's just drinking pancakes.
I think I find the room more interesting than the traditional sex.
That's incredible.
After waiting for the storm, he started to collect fools.
I need you for each other.
Tom and I know the truth.
That's a crime.
Tom's gonna grow up.
Do you have your e-mail address?
You got caught, you're not ready.
Tommy knew where Maria put her car down.
You should be on board now.
Tom and Mary are not living in the same state.
Look!
Don't keep your ring.
Sometimes I go to the movies.
He never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me.
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not gonna shoot Tom.
Tom's got a piece of meat from the bitch.
I didn't mean to tell you that.
I'm not going to Boston.
Tom had to go home earlier.
The prices are up.
Get out of here.
I didn't buy the car.
How much is the bus going?
You're not doing anything!
Is it hard to get French?
I see a house.
It's just that you know, it's really bad luck.
He's used to smoking with us.
You like the artist?
I'm eating very good food in the army.
I used to sleep on the floor when I saw my grandmother and my grandfather.
We were there.
Tommy left the team after three games.
I'm kidding.
The circus that the pincer brought to the table was still a winner.
If I'm big, I'd like to be a fireman.
It's a very dangerous sport where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after the baby's play.
Now it's up to them.
Take us to town.
He spent three months on the bridge.
Tom's in a hurry.
It's just that he started reading the book when someone knocked on the door.
I just went to work when the phone broke.
I feel helpless.
Inductive fireplaces use magnets to direct the poles and serenes.
Thank you for you.
They've got everything they need.
He's always on my side.
No one likes a hug.
He's a decent man.
It's all right, it's over.
The police arrested the constable.
I love things like that.
You let us go there or not.
Why did you become a lawyer?
I'm back.
You shouldn't wait long.
Tom seems to enjoy the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How disgusting!
Tom took the boxes along the side.
It's connected that the bear loves the honey.
We're on our way.
Don't worry about getting away.
I'll see you soon.
Did you ask them to wait?
I got drunk, and I got ready for school.
Where's the phone book?
I'm fine.
The cats will be big.
Get your car down in an empty room.
It's his Christmas gift.
You know what?
It's never too late to learn.
Look at Google Translator.
You're my princess.
What a wonderful place!
We could do something for Tom.
I'll keep this in mind.
The house was big.
We are happy to accept your offer.
I thought so.
It wasn't Tom.
Why don't we go out for a party tonight?
The dreams have become reality.
Don't give up on yourself.
Tom told me he was home last night.
I didn't tell anyone you were here.
That's very good news.
Does it matter?
Majuko designed his own clothes.
That's what's happening in Australia.
The dragon is a fierce language.
I wanted to know the truth.
What kind of movies do you want to watch?
Tom's breathing.
Please fix this.
Tom lost his leg as a result of his arrest.
Can I ask you a question?
Find out what I found.
I'm sick of sea.
You know, they've been thrown into Florida.
Tom's too young, isn't he?
Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't get my fingerprint.
I just don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to go home.
He was like a father to me.
You're gonna hurt me.
Help's on the way.
Are they speaking French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep looking.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come on, how are you?
I think they're joining us.
You've grown up.
I'm looking for my phone.
Listen to me.
No one can stop it anymore.
Who did you see?
I'll sleep here.
Tom threw Mary out of the house.
Mari got hurt when Tommy bought her some fresheners.
Japan's a group of islands, many mountains and almost nothing in the forest.
We usually eat fresh fish.
She put the blue folder on the table.
Two years old, but not as tall as I am.
This meat is well past milk.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
Tonight I like to follow the tradition of making a walk along the roof.
What can we count on?
There's a hole in my leg.
The animals are afraid of fire.
It wasn't a week.
Don't go to school just because they're waiting for you.
The box is almost empty.
It's gonna happen.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
I need a toaster.
You understand women's language.
I think Tom's still out of work.
Please pay attention.
I'm ready to help you at any time.
We'll be there.
The battery's down.
He found a good meeting for me.
We're all going to die sooner or later.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you bought it yet?
Tom came to the stand.
Tommy couldn't replace his loneliness.
We tried to warn.
I found that our voice was very complicated, contrary to the expert, which was very simple.
You better watch out.
Tom loves the kids.
It's funny.
It's not that bad.
Tommy touched my hand.
Who brought this?
He's got a full cup of wine.
These bananas don't feel.
Let's get out of here.
But I don't care.
I think you were right.
Where'd they keep the wedding?
I'll be in the stream.
It wasn't the first time they did it.
The water is cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel crazy.
That's a good place to go.
Do you have any questions?
It's sabotage.
Smell all night, drying in the morning.
When do they keep the choices?
Tom's supportive.
Tom walked in.
I was sitting in Bern in a chair at the office of freedom when I was attacked by a sudden thought: if a man is free, he doesn't feel his own weight.
Speak aloud, everyone will listen to you.
They're installing a new system of influence on the train.
We believe in God.
Your role is over.
Where are we going tonight?
He's dressed in a hairdresser.
We should've bought three wines.
May I have a loan?
I can't find Tim.
Stand straight.
Thania's position is transferred.
I hope so.
That's not interesting.
You've always been like that.
The sun fell down on the horizon and burned down.
Which fear has he won?
Tom's home.
Tom dropped a piece of meat and made it to his uncle.
I'll try again.
You never know what's going to happen.
If everything goes well, they graduate in 2001 at the university.
The decision was postponed.
It's never happened to me like this.
Danina's got a three-hour flight.
He broke his face with a kisser.
I don't understand what's so funny about this.
I'll kiss Tomit.
Tom left it here.
I was the only one who survived.
He advised her to quit smoking, but she didn't listen to him.
He's got you crying!
Tom's got the rest.
Are you hungry at all?
My watch is cheaper than yours.
I can't remember how Tommy looked.
Are you crazy or what?
We appreciate his ability.
I feel better.
The director of the new film is an angel of a child.
He's in college.
They are responsible for fundamental freedoms for a little security, not one of them is worth it.
There's a girl who's brave.
He looked into his face.
Why don't you come with us?
Tom saw someone.
He's a real bastard!
I love math.
You made a mistake.
Danny treated me with respect.
But it's not your fault.
If I were in your place, I'd ask him.
Do you know this man?
I have to work tonight.
What do you think he was watching the TV in this room last night?
Tom wanted to keep the stolen money for you.
I got a half-grapefruit in the morning.
I don't think there's a god.
Tom doesn't know who he believes: John or Mary.
Age doesn't mean you don't have to use your imagination anymore.
It was a nightmare last night.
If I had money, I'd go around the world.
The political situation changed.
You can go first.
Tom went into the reading and wanted to go play.
I don't know what Tomina's got.
It's Sunday.
I should've stayed out of it.
Do you have feelings for Tom?
I hate that movie.
It was yesterday.
I'll tie my shoes.
Where'd you get your box?
It's just overwhelming.
The nearest town is behind the clouds.
What are you reading now?
There are jeans and paints that take security guards away from them.
Shall we go to the movie now?
I know you can do this.
He didn't know that for Tom.
These were his last words.
Tom likes baseball sports.
I was very angry.
At first, I was disappointed.
I'd better have done it if I had more time.
Why didn't you mention there was a witness?
You can do it when it's time for you.
Go ahead, please.
Get yourself this bottle!
Africa's human wisdom.
I'm glad Tommy's leaving.
Did you talk to Tominak about this?
It's probably between us.
Do you have a volunteer?
Tom's mother's still buying his clothes.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I knew Tom knew something.
Tom was apparently angry.
It's over for the October.
Maybe he's still waiting for you.
Welcome to Boston.
I'm always late.
Tom was sitting at the end of the table.
Tom was nice, but Mary wasn't.
You're better than you are.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
If you don't behave well, it won't be Mikul√°s.
You're too young to buy cigarettes.
It was wrong to kiss Tom.
Tom seems uncomfortable.
This wine is almost bigger than you.
Do you accept some advice?
Oh, that's why it's about.
Zagrab, Croatia's capital.
That's inevitable.
This guy's loud, and it's not important to deal with him.
You two talked to me.
Pocks!
Tom needs to take better care of himself.
Why don't you take your pants off?
Excuse me?
Tom says the air is too hot.
I know the secret.
The fire burned down the apartment.
Who's gonna do it?
Tom should've done that sooner.
She's staying in a hotel.
I loved that art.
Maradok, if you can.
He told us a story about a boy, Tom Sawyer.
Tom can do it.
Anyone who doesn't drink in a company, that's a thief or a spy.
That's bullshit.
This moment should never end.
Yesterday, they were put on a stand-alone schedule.
- Can I take a look at your jacket?
Please give her my best congratulations.
Tom couldn't open the gate.
Tell me about this magic!
Access only for the staff.
Tomina's been able to move something.
Where can we meet?
There's no right answer.
There were children of rich families in all ages.
The crystal clear water was very hot.
There's no other entertainment left.
We have an acceptable solution.
The new school had to take into account the special needs of young people.
Lapozz, please.
Everything that happened between us was a lie?
It's a picture.
It's close enough.
It's like brigara!
I'm glad you're here, Tom.
That's what Tommy tells me.
It's Tommy's heir, like his twin brother, but it's a winner.
We need to be Prudens.
You're out without a word.
I never said that!
I don't care.
I'm so old.
I'll be there for the sugar.
I cut the moss.
I found Tomit there.
Mr. Jones was late because I had a little rest in the hour.
Henry wants to see you.
Can you eat?
I've got a meeting today.
We're not leaving.
Tom didn't try to replace the truth.
I was happy last night.
Can I ask you your name?
All statements are fake.
It's my turn.
I'm sorry, but it was a big deal.
Tom should've listened to Mari.
Tom apologized to Mary for the inconvenience he caused.
I'll apologize later.
I realized he was wearing a new hat.
Hold on, please.
She left me without a kiss.
I need to see it.
Don't leave it to me.
It'd be a nice little coffee.
There's plenty of flowers in the garden.
Tom called it too loud.
The answer was simple.
He shouldn't have come this early.
You always ask your opinion.
Let's do something else.
The collective responsibility means liability.
The churches need to learn sign language so they can teach.
I know who lives in this house.
Who's going to drive?
I'm done behind the line.
Tom's got the smile on his feet.
I'm usually talking to Tommy in France.
Where are you?
It's okay.
Tom trusted his doctors.
They're not gonna get caught up in this.
Tom won the debate.
Can you stand on your feet with your eyes closed for a minute?
Nakamatsu was very upset when he asked his own stupid question.
You can go as well.
I'm glad Tom was able to change his name.
I know it's weird.
I was sitting on the ground.
He didn't just betray me, but also for my dog.
Tom's in trouble.
I'm really sorry, it seems like I lost your chance.
It's a public beach.
Go and get Tom some food.
That's just Tommy.
It's very weird.
Do you have any medicines?
It's a horrible word.
When I give you instructions, start the machine!
Many parents think there's too much power on TV.
I've got my own mind!
I'm working.
You're like me.
That's very funny.
Can I play my room?
All gods are possible, but they only exist once.
That's very, very good.
It's not a decision yet.
How much did we do?
Take off your belt.
The door's not closed.
It's Tony's book.
They're here in time.
He was not careful.
You know I can do it.
That's not enough.
He looked at his cell phone and noticed that three of you already have two.
Tom was home when it happened.
I'm gonna have a little fun.
I got a good shot.
The award of the scientific fee has decided to offer the financial asset for the purpose of charity.
I didn't get it.
His name is Tom, and not John.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
I'll rest in the next month.
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
This book is amazing.
Do you remember who I am?
Let's all dance!
He's just a man.
Can I help you, sir?
I want to know why women live more than men.
I can't stay in this house.
I pay well.
They're both in the yard.
I took my bags off my room with my back.
Is the cook alive, or is he dead?
He could be the man I need.
I hate to say that, but Tom and Mary are right.
My pulse is irregular.
Tom was really sick.
When we got married, my parents gave me this house.
He's never losing hope.
I've lost my hair in the house.
Every morning he's getting dressed.
Get your fingers up!
I'd like to say thank you for everything you did.
Tom suggested I don't do it.
I'm not happy at all.
Sorry about last night.
It's time for us to kiss.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
It happened to me several times.
The trees are burning.
Tom asked Mary to come in.
It works perfectly on the iPhone home.
Maybe it's a trap.
Remember him coming home early.
Tom got up in the morning.
It's only three days long and we've got enough water.
You have a good memory.
Why are you buying?
Ten months after he left, he walked home.
Tom came too late.
Tom's out.
Your words are the only ones that should be translated on this website.
What am I supposed to do?
I think he's leaving.
Let's keep a little quiet.
It's a shame running, but it's useful.
You're going to get the heat.
I don't.
I've been told.
That's weird.
In capitalism, there's no smoking to buy.
He was relieved of the horror of the massacre.
They don't tell me what's going to happen.
I don't like to talk about it.
It's too small for you.
Tom gave Mary everything.
Go on, try it.
Put a finger on it.
Muiriel is 20 years old.
- A drink?
He opened the ceiling, and now it's like a house.
I'll read a letter.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
I used to sleep in the open window.
He's got a newspaper.
If you're living in a foreign city, you need a car.
I'm so sorry.
I'd like to help her, but I don't know how.
You're crazy.
My patience is due to the limit.
Tommy brought a flower to Marina.
This isn't happening to me first.
Don't fight!
I can't help it.
It could be a long time.
Good morning, Mike.
I'm coming here.
I don't know his name.
Which of the ten favorite movies?
I'd like some stuff.
Paper took his thoughts.
John wants to shut up.
It's close to Maria.
Please fix it.
Where's Mom?
Tommy's never seen Mari get so angry before.
You're under a dream.
This computer is the most expensive one.
Guns.
The naughty boy rejected his name.
I wish I had learned harder in my younger years.
That means the right price.
I need paper and toll.
I hate to go in.
Tommy's weird.
Why do you want to be pregnant?
Don't compare yourself to others.
Your meal's in the south.
We're classmates.
Are you still here on this afternoon?
At least they're watching me.
Tom's short-lived.
Do you have a boyfriend?
My son has become a man.
Everyone's at risk.
Did they get this in the middle of it?
The defense program can't be very good.
It's all mine.
Tom was sick.
Can I pay for the MasterCard card?
Who can do this?
Don't be rude.
When you wake up tomorrow morning, you'll find something wonderful.
I wonder when he'll be here.
I don't think I'll ever get Korean food.
Scientists have identified the entire genetic state of cancer.
I don't know what you heard about it.
He likes cheese.
You're careful.
Tom's gonna sit down.
The troops stopped because of the powerful conquests.
Tom went to work to get news.
I'm going to go.
Tom's very energyy.
No one called it.
The world is a great place.
Look again.
I have nothing to do with it.
You were treated like a child.
Oil and water don't break.
I'll tell you what's going on.
There's some half-land for you.
We're still fighting how he got away.
You'd do better if you didn't get too much.
Tommy always keeps his word.
You're going to lose.
Please do everything you think you need.
I'd like to marry such a girl.
They're checking the ground.
Tom's done a good job.
I'm in a hurry.
Tom always does that.
She showed him my picture.
It won't work for me.
Don't open it.
- What are you doing tonight?
You got it now.
Pick up the darker, let's get some light.
I'll never love you.
Tom talked.
He's got a lot of mistakes, but I'd rather love him.
What's my count?
Tom's probably gonna be satisfied.
There's two green dolls around.
Did you count on something like that?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I should've been there at the meeting.
It's too hot.
We're in the store.
I'm not dead.
You know, I'm going to go to the lab tomorrow.
We know this song.
Tom's serious.
I can win if I'm lucky.
This is communism.
Come on, let's talk about the flowers.
I'm sorry when you heard the story.
Some words are too hard for me.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
It's hard for everyone to do it.
He's powerful.
Our morning start depends on the timing.
I'm a third.
There's no such example.
Maybe you're making a mistake.
She's not here.
That's what I went through with.
Let's not talk about it.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
Tom found a wounded man.
What's my home count?
This is a hard part.
Whatever you do, don't tell Tam√°s.
I'm glad you're here.
Those shoes are too small for you.
He gave the police some personal description of the one he saw.
There's the bus!
They didn't find DNS as evidence.
Tom's in trouble when he buys a package.
Do you know a good hunter?
Don't come in!
You're very upset.
Tomina's not strong for parlor parking.
The good times are over.
The dinner was nice!
Just like you don't know.
You're probably right.
I need a few hours to sleep.
What's wrong with you?
It's a shame you've done this thing.
Watch out for your little sister until her mother gets out.
I came to talk to Tommy.
Why did you do that?
I usually get coffee in the coffee shop.
You asked for the visa.
Tom's serious.
You're all different.
He loves music very much.
Tom and Marika felt good about themselves.
It's a dictionary.
It's a real beauty.
Oh, my God, Mary, are you okay?
I know what you don't have to do.
This place is bad.
I can't believe this anymore.
Time's very fast.
Call Tominak.
Another thing to learn and learn a language.
You've got to take the drink down.
That was Tom, wasn't it?
Tom made it.
One hour later, the lake was even higher.
What did he want?
I was on the bus.
I'll drink everything except your leave.
Don't worry about us.
I need money.
One dog is still alive.
I can stand against everything, just not the temptation.
Just shut the door.
I need money.
That's pretty serious.
We're stuck.
Tom became a little red.
Here's an example.
Thank you for asking this question.
The door has been opened.
For my health, I did this.
It's a kitchen.
How do we know the light is faster than the sound?
Tommy turned his back on the French flag.
I want to win that game.
He lived there for about five years.
It's been 30 years, but it's still her parents' fault.
I've been married for two years.
He was worried about his health problems.
Within a year, my son grew stronger.
How beautiful!
I think I forgot home.
I promised my parents I wouldn't drink.
Tom said he'd kiss Chinese bread.
We're very similar.
That was Chinese to me.
Oh, my God!
I've won a lot on my car sales.
I see you've done this before.
Don't lose your patience.
The solution was in front of my eyes, I didn't even notice.
One more time, one more time.
That's very good.
Didn't we meet somewhere?
Tom's talking a little French.
Tommy's the best player in our team.
It's actually worse.
We can't wait anymore.
Where's Paris?
Let's take care of his ability.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
I can't handle the stress.
We can't agree with you on this.
I'm sure she's taking care of Maria now.
Tommy can't handle the bugs.
Mary was so beautiful that Tom bought it twice.
There's Christian Arabic, too.
I told you to like you, Tommy.
I'll be better next day.
That's the danger.
If there's too much work, it's bad, but it's too much free.
Tom's gonna quit.
A beautiful six-pounded guy is on the roof.
It was really fast.
I assured Tom that I would.
Of course.
Can I borrow three dollars?
I didn't understand.
It's a good idea to take this substance.
I went to Rome.
Come on?
Did Tom grow up in Boston?
Get out of here!
It's my sense that this side is a long romantic region that the principals, Tommy and Mari, have.
I have to follow.
I bought my house for two years.
Hold it and put it in the fire.
Come on, meet me.
Can I take a shower?
The bad weather kept them from the winding-up.
I'm buying houses and vegetables.
Maria and Elke are not brothers.
I love the moon.
You can't vote unless you're fourteen or older.
Tom's having a good time.
I haven't eaten meat before.
Did you show me the book?
We are eager to carry out this project immediately.
It's a powerful song.
Do you know where Toledo is in Spain?
We'll work in Boston next year.
It's not my keys.
You're my life, my love.
Do you really think I can help you?
What if we get in?
Do you read the Bible?
It's got some tea.
I can assure you, we're not gonna make this mistake again.
May 5th is your birthday.
You really need to keep your fears chaste, that's a living animal in you.
A meal shouldn't look like that.
Tommy's collecting the meteorites.
Tom ruled the car with his land.
What are you doing?
Can't you do anything to stop it?
Can you stand at the bar?
First of all, don't forget to write to me.
I recognized her face.
Whatever happens, you just smile.
I'm ready to leave the meeting because of the shower.
Why don't I sit down?
He's in school.
Watch out for me.
He'd take your help.
Wait!
Don't get your word.
They need you.
Tamaus shut the door before Maria.
How long do I take this?
The student's lunch is between 11 and 1.
Three months ago, they were married.
I got your food.
How many guards do you have on a macadamia?
I think the experiment is very difficult.
This pot contains water.
Close that door.
I don't wear makeup.
I don't care about it anymore.
Tom's alive.
Tom got into his bag and pulled out a package card.
Am I right?
Tom and Mari went to a party to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Tam√°s may be working long.
Shut the air conditioner down!
What's your mother's name?
One day he lives for another, he doesn't have to save a pill.
Is your watch okay?
He died because of a lack of cash.
Tom, where are we?
I don't know how to shut up with an adult.
Oh, thank you.
I like this book at least.
Where are you now?
He's badly hurt.
Please don't lie to me.
Tomi dance.
Tom can sit here if he wants to.
He wasn't so excited at that time.
Do you have enough tarotres?
The boxole olives take a very expensive jeans. They go to the Olympic village, put their jeans in the dress bar, and add a statement: If you take the jeans, I will kill them. The Olympics will go back in an hour and see that the jeans are gone, only one side is in the place: You have to get them first.
Tom's a great dancer.
You're calling!
The situation has improved.
The water's up to the ground.
It's actually working.
Please change the interface.
Now listen to him!
I should have said I didn't feel it.
Why do you want to join the army, Tam√°s?
He's happy with his new car.
The coffeer's on the ground, with two drinks.
I was born a farmer.
I got a car.
No one's gonna die.
Sunday is the last day of the week.
Thank you all for your congratulations.
Just call Tominak.
I'm back early.
I've prepared a toy for Maria.
I wish you wouldn't be working.
Tom's not the only one.
It was Japan's former capital.
Tommy is very nice to me, but Samink has a lot more money.
Tom's been drinking too much.
He's got the beer.
Tommy did it like he didn't know anything about it.
No one's inexhaustible.
Tom pressed the button and waited.
I don't know why this hasn't happened before.
The heat is great tonight.
He took greater responsibility with his new position.
Why are you so strict?
I wish I could raise my wife.
Write down your name.
Tom's real.
When will this end?
You met my sister, didn't you?
Tom's gonna be fine.
He wants to be funny.
Tom was young and powerful.
I'm asking for a martini.
He still loves me, and I think I love him too.
Toma was a strange dream last night.
I didn't think so.
I fixed the car yesterday.
Get my arm off me.
What's wrong with me?
The fear was totally unfounded.
My country is the whole world.
The grass is a kind of energy.
The worst came in.
The building just started.
This will threaten the welfare of the city.
The propaganda's communication is the war they want to win.
I haven't tried yet.
We'll meet you wherever you want.
Mary is such a lovely girl that everyone loves her.
You've changed anything since?
I'm tired of everything.
The accident has caused thousands.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
She's not a witch anymore.
Your hair's starting to get out.
I got it!
The court has declared the innocence of the accused.
We're not gonna win.
Very intelligent.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I'm in the basement.
Tom's an unencumbered guest.
Mary died in the womb.
That's exactly what they want.
It's probably convincing.
I'm familiar with it.
You have to go to the doctor.
I can't wait anymore.
Japan is a coastal country surrounded by sea on every side.
After my first catering training, I felt all the pain I felt was burning.
Let's keep learning.
You're going to sync Tom.
That's my skin color.
You're in the chair.
Who's going for a husband?
What?
I lost my sister-in-law.
I'm talking about an experiential, like my mother tongue.
Put them on the table.
Is it true that you love soda coffee?
I'm sorry!
Just do it.
I improvised.
Help yourself, and God will help you.
Maybe there are other reasons.
He's buying cars.
You're good at lying, aren't you?
It's not a funeral.
I'm going home now.
I was born on a ship.
The red isn't your color.
They're coming apart.
I'm not afraid.
According to our knowledge of language, it's a human invention.
They've got enough capital to build up another guy.
Now you can go home if you like.
Every human being is equal to God.
They said it was a crime.
Two eyes.
Are you in YouTube?
Where's the problem?
They can go wherever they want.
Magdalena, my oldest daughter is like an angel.
I don't think things will change.
Tom will never know what happened.

He's staying for you.
I should've done this somewhere else.

Tom was one of the many who therefore objected to the proposal.
I've got a lot of time.
I don't speak French.
Her parents are older than my parents.
Sami and Layla haven't lived together for six years.
I opened it on the lot.
What's your name?
No one hurt her.
Take my car.
You don't have to get the kids out of the bathroom.
What a day!
You waited for Tom, didn't you?
Then no one saw him.
Neither do I.
There's no better chance.
Really, isn't it?
How long has your office been open?
I'm not as bad as I was anymore.
I'll call you a beer.
We've been through months in the past year.
He didn't have more than a hundred.
Is everybody here?
He'll be back soon.
I'm just kidding.
In addition to his inhumanity to the defendant's custody.
If I were in your place, I'd be right back.
Where did you learn everything?
You can't count on his help.
Are you kidding?
It wasn't sure if she was gonna marry him.
I've frozen my software.
Calm down!
May I?
Open the door to love.
Did your parents give you anything?
The history of the water cycle is not limited to the Bible.
I'd like to apologize for my son's name.

Without you, you're no one.
Are you saying Tom's hiding something from us?
Tom says it's impossible.

He's got some work to do.
It never existed.
Are you happy?
It's never too late for you to be what you could have been.
Tom asked me to help Mary.
We've had too much food.

He answered that he didn't know anything about it.
Can I get some ice cream?
Did they hurt you?
I'll introduce Tomit.
I should have been much more precise.
And how do you know?
I want to see it.
Tom knows.

It's not a novelty.
What a place!
I helped.
Do you love this country?
Green isn't good with the lilac.
I don't think that's what it's like to be a red necktie.
We're approaching the target.

Do you have any idea how we can solve this problem?
Money's coming all the way.
Tommy continued the game.
He gave a piece of shit to his face.
I've got another plan tomorrow.
You're the new assistant?
They were so happy when we arrived.
I don't believe in the brains.
The remote calls were expensive in the vicinity.
I'll help you.
I'll give you my word about smoking.
What's the name of those tablets?

Let go of me!
Tom spent his whole life studying cats.
He spoke very well in English for my surprise.
Tom is our oldest son.
He's in a good mood.
I'll always feed you in my heart.
Probably possible.
What Tommy did is that he showed courage.
Tom is a very dangerous man.
I came to the station in time.
What's this place?
They're looking for Tam√°.
Tom can't help it.
They're working all day.
Today no one believes in ghosts.
What happened on October 20th?

I thought you might know.
Where did you get the carrot on your face?
I want to go to England.
When Tom went to rest, his son took over his business.
I didn't get an invitation.

Tom just didn't want to eat.
According to the teacher's height, he put the kids in line.
I didn't finish my school.
It's best time for us to do something about it.

Give me the map!
He doesn't like the idea at all.
You're here.
We'll move in the next month.
I'd like to look around.
Tom will help you.
Tom's on the train.
Three years younger than Marin.
He was very old.
The scriptural languages say they're the worst.
Tom's a good guy?
Let's sit down and talk up.
My father was a luncher who spent the whole day sitting on his back and eating candy.
Tom hasn't been very good at his job lately.
Why is my sister so hot?
Use your life to create paradises.
Tom is a really great guy.
You know who made it?
That's great.
No one's sitting here.
Tom told you something, didn't he?
Kind's hiding.
I got a letter from my mother yesterday.
He left you completely in his office.
You do yourself anyway!
Get up!
They've lost their money.
I'm not sure Tom wants to come with us to Boston.

You're working too hard.
His explanations were taken.
My tent was gone.
I'm good.
I'll take care of it.
I got up at 6:00 this morning.
Tom left his car behind.
The pandas love the bambous.
Why didn't you help them?
I'm not a optimist right now.
Let's go.
That's amazing!
You're kidding me.
You're ready.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
Are you talking about personal experience?
Can I come in?
That was a deep point, things have improved since then.
I don't know much about Russia.
You've been hit by a bullet.
There's an animal on the beach.
Tom looks like he's getting together.
I think you're worth it.
Come with me.
The water was soft.
She offered me a gift that she had made.
Get in there before you go in.
I'm a regular drinker.
Please tell Tomina he has to go.
I usually drink two coffees at your table.
You were better.
The fatty fats are getting worse because of oxidation.
How many hours does it open?
You're asking for some trouble?
I'm grateful.
We need to get ready for the future.
Mom, can I swim?
I gave him all the money I had for him.
I need that.
Turn your head over here.
What kind of food do you don't like?
I'd love to do it again.
I thought about Tom.
They were arrested.
I knew Tom wouldn't change.
Please close the door.
The interview was held yesterday.

It's already in progress.
You can't talk to anyone about this.

What Tom told Mary was wrong.
No one asked Tom about it.
We'll leave it to you later.
Tell them where I am.
The hard work hasn't killed anyone yet, but why are we risking it?
We're curious.
There was no water in the cave.
Tom knows one.
What's going on?

Is this the key you're looking for?
I hope no one has ever seen you.
Our teacher's going to be home from abroad in August.

I told you three weeks ago.
If you don't like it, you can go.
He bought a new car.
