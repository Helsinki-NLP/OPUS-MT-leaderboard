28-year-old cook in San Francisco Mall to be found
A 28-year-old cook, recently taken to San Francisco, was found at the house of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to harm him, "It went back to him."
The Leichnam found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, sharing the judicial medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was committed as a murder and the investigations were under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston six months ago, had created his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
One speaker of the Sons & Daughters said that they would be "crushed and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a good family and we will miss him painfully," said the speaker.
Our thoughts and training are in this difficult time with Franks family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank lived in hostels at first, but that, "the things went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
It was always to cook something to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of translation.
He was the brother who fell asleep with the power.
"With everything in the world, he was this undiminished diamond that lit up every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD’s address number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood Star very clear in an interview now.
"I'll always be stuck in drawers or picked up by outside labels, which have little to do with me and the reality."
"I don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are more expensive to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered "Miss Perfect" as explained in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actor spends most of his time at home, in the form of a TV show with a locker shower and Mexican food, it is in the magazine.
The question is, "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is a unique mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Longer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is remarkable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little difference with an outing on the beach.
For the 58 years, it was a premium.
CHIO: "Goldene Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses reminded their cheerleaders that they were hunting in the fast gallop to go home to the feeding troughs.
A mile at this time, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And as a result, the railways were already over.
On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournaments - again near horses.
He and his family were able to take over the arrangement of the ALRV, and on a horse he did not even go for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports help gave the man from the ahausen in a small gala the gold sports pyramids.
There is no need for the sympathetic sporter to be awarded.
Federal Service Centre, Silvernes Lorbeerblatt, Championships-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already raised him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first priest, Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will be granted not only for sports success but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting nursery.
And so he also gave the price of EUR 25,000.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master winner was included on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of the German sport".
The most outstanding are Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the daughter of Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter Michael Kolbe, Bob Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wiene, the Springer Alwin Chocolate and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wonderful.
Many of these athletes had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustra society traveled to Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza price was high.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want it.
At the same time, the two U.S. presidents are involved in tax and energy policy, as well as in a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
He's over the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those who doubt and warn how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants the economy to spend on death and regulate death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, accused by Trump.
It will go back to regulations massively, and it is strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton says, however, that the state has certain tasks to perform, he has opportunities to open up and needs money for it.
That's why the taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
They are both very close to the issue of infrastructure.
In the case of investment, Trump and Clinton say almost the same.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly rejected by the state-critical theater flight of the Republicans.
Thus, there may be further internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and raise coal supply in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in protected areas so far as the Paris Climate Protection Agreement is to be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly build renewable energy with its investment programme and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
However, not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.
The TPP, the trans-phase trade agreement, does not want to sign both of them.
At the same time, both the United States and the United States do not want to isolate themselves from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better.
They should also be better paid, calling for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger strike.
She wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trup wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: Once he says: The minimum wage has to cry, then he says he shouldn't be changed.
However, the major debate in the coming months may have to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to release the economy and the citizens to increase growth.
His critics warned him that the budget deficit would only be even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every woman fled has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers access.
Four women sit in a big kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at least a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He's looking newly in the room with big eyes.
His mother starts on the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles short and kisses the little ones.
The scene works normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a regional business leader of Condrobs, a social worker in Bayern, and she works in particular with the theme of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Münchner North in one of the few decentral accommodations for isolated women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs, together with Profamilia and Munich's women's assistance, set up the facility.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It's not too much to say: Any woman who comes here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they suffer from torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope givers," she says.
For women, there are other reasons for fleeing: "Many are secret because they don't see any other way."
In their home they have made experience of sexual violence, rape, murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
The flight is going on.
"The climber, for example for a bottle of water asks for sexual action, is not rare," Bahr says.
And women are the only ones who will not be protected from their families.
Whoever thinks it's the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, Irre, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and abused by the worst cases.
This means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the apartment in Munich north are traumatized.
"Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created."
Many women were so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."
Since they often didn't want to help, more accommodations are needed only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bayern, the seven regional governments are responsible for the introduction of refugees.
On the question of whether they were from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answered with no.
There is no such thing in the overflake and overfranches of governments.
Even in Swaben, only fled women are not given away separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesman.
In Oberbayern, sub- and central branches, there are stockworks or homes in some communities only for independent women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bayern, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be subjected to separate treatment by men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be buried separately."
"If the private parties or men and women are committed together, it can be - further - violence against women."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study.
As the women are very satisfied with this need for protection, you can take advantage of the orange that it is on the house in Munich.
"Since he said he's got us, we've got a long watchlist," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assisting experts: Requirements for new work-related measures
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their cooperation to adopt new work-fighting measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to adopt more action since early September.
The JDC said that it was the Minister's intention to address the concerns concerning the contract.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students agreed to cancel a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was paid by 58% of its members who voted in favour of the elections.
In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "ly calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the Board of the JDC has agreed to fully cancel the proposed new contract and requested formal negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's failure, the JDC Board today made a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of educational action which began in September.
The conflicts led to the six times this year’s assistant doctors covering the first total cases in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malavana will be returning after the election to cancel the agreed terms recommended by the BMA.
He shared with BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, with the aim of benefiting and adopting the contract.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: A Alliance of Foreigners?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and declare an official end of the eight months of the ongoing war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this pardon most.
It gave me the handcuff, yes.
But Putin’s lips acted mildly and he did not shed heat, even for his remaining relationships.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke again from his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even be improved.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan's taking place as if something bad had never happened.
I thought his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But one of Putin's outstanding, sustainable coal showed that the Head of State of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the loss of a Russian fighter at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's response to the time was exhilarated.
Putin shared out and accused Ankara to be Russia in the back.
It was even bigger because it was started by a distant friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild the veins if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear all the blame.
Most importantly, the charges of leading officials were that Erdogan's family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria, which was controlled by the said Islamic state.
He's been fighting this thing.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message said it was time to look ahead.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to buy some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a gun stand are clear.
Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he's almost hit his office in a broken state.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also hit him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number is almost 90%.
Travel operators and charter companies in Russia will be made easier when the flights are re-arrived.
They count on a late-seasonal ansurgeon.
This week, the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows: "Tourists there long, tomato long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the west as its reaction to the attempt to take power is considered a weak response.
To this end, the ongoing round on the cut-off time of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which aims to take advantage of the cold vote and reduce Turkey's relationship to the west.
The Russian Head of State in Ankara has certainly won a bonus in order to require support for the elected state agencies after the attempted state aid has been granted.
This is a self-evident certainty for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of change in regimes.
The summit in this beautiful palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as an analyst once described to me, to represent "allyness of outsiders": two countries that are lost from the west and feel ill-treated and are now connected.
Nevertheless, despite the public deficit, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow soon became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be noted that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents at the press conference said that they had never discussed the subject.
The President of Turkey obviously refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey has rejected the Russian campaign, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the Bank's Head.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been away since it had to be collapsed almost eight years ago and saved.
At this time, brand strategies "RBS" have been used to protect other end-user financial markets.
She supported the international sport with millions of dollars on sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to turn more national brands into the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the central seat and the birth note are exchanged to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will become more important - Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will be on our investment brand and on the brand that will be employed by our employees, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we're not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these brands with the customers.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the reality of the different brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop ourselves into the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the head of the board.
It would have been very interesting three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori asks Champagner for a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000 wins
The Jockey Frankie Dettori guaranteed his 3,000 British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set on Pred selection trained by John Gosden on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flatline.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edry and Willie Carson.
The dreamy winner Dettori, who won at Ghyyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I've been here 30 years ago.
It's not big meetings, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banana Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm easy and very upset.
Dettori takes up the Jubilee when he holds the victory on Predelection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the barrier race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-year-old Derbysier had 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the moderns and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that has just arrived before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligence that distinguishes him from others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic messenger for race, his enthusiastism and charisma who has been interested in fans for years for this kind of sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie's been winning in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the ridges of the British fleet for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorie Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, when he returned from his six-month-old spring, he showed an impressive strength to overcome his doubts and return to his best form.
And he's not yet at the end - Dettori has once said that he wants to continue in competition until his 50th year of life.
Russia Putin fires chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly abandoned his former boss Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's greatest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a view of the Kremlin, Putin stated that without giving reasons, "the resignation of Ivanovs has been appointed by his duties as president of the Russian Presidency".
Anton Vaino, who has been a member of Ivanov's staff since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he completed his studies at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the mission in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website, it is (in Russian) that he was later the Chief of Protocols and Heads of Staff of Government.
He said to Putin about his appointment: "Thanks for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the Government to support your work as Head of State in the implementation of legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do you trust the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow a secret weapon.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the most trusted and trusted Vladimir Putins and worked as he worked for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was posted on the television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would appeal to his own will.
But despite the room for the camera, there are only a few of them convinced - especially now, shortly before Parliament's elections.
So here's the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was first elected as a potential president once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - was put to a great deal of trouble.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that in early 2012 I had prayed for these very complicated posts - you could almost say - to trust the unfortunate posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
He was former Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy representative.
As Putin reached power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most.
It was first accepted that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office Putins had failed to understand the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another nearby connected Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became the Prime Minister three and a half years before he came back to the President.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson Fired After He Killed Manufacturers
Gibson was involved in a physical replacement at the seat of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his announcement in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before his announcement.
In the set, it came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I'll take care of the case," he said in a message.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series followed by a team of FBI agents will be published according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which is expected to be published at a later date.
The 54-year-old who played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg was the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love criminal Minds and I've been covering my entire heart for the last 12 years," said Gibson in a release on Friday.
I had hoped to be at the end of it, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful Crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned excretion of the twelfth stage is scheduled on 28 September.
Seats for fish that are in gardens in Banff countries
A resident of Banff asked for assistance in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be at the 75-fishes of sandals that were extracted from a spring.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two waves long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Break now connected to Fife
The € 1.35 billion thine project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four resolutions of the "covered glass" that draw close to each of the three doors of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 steels.
The € 1.35 billion thine project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic level in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the mass size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the Viadukt and the bridgedeck is a hard activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth have a bethouse for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be mounted on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first conclusion is a major milestone in each bridge project.
This fantastic project represents a future high- and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road cover section and its connection to the North Tower deck in development, we had to close the remaining gaps on the north or the country side.
This was achieved by drawing up the north coastal bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very hard work.
Massive, since the Viadukt is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons is measured and had to be taken up at an increase of about 3 %.
Heikkel, because the tolerances on which the team is working were winzig - on each side they only weigh a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Salvation in the Moelfree Bay: Three men have "Happy to Be Still in Life"
Three men have "happy to be alive" after being shot by their fishing boat before Angelesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station ran on Friday at 13:20 BST Alarm, after a Crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had to swim safely while their boat continued to move out of its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around and presented us the worst," said the director of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already pushed the boat out of its range until we put it to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man was created at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boje without rescue.
They all arrived on board the coastal rectification boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water have been happy to be alive.
The boat engine, however, had an emergency plane, but it was off at the centre of the boat by the person who was driving the boat.
Someone's been waiting today for these men.
Severely damaged - a man joins his ex-Freundin
A man attacked his ex-Freundin in Hamburg-Harburg with a messer and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-olds had the keys to their apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic cuts the clothes of his ex-freundin.
When this came into the apartment, he was twice on her.
The 44-year-olds were injured by hand and body.
The police could catch the killer.
During the 50's the clothes of his ex-Freundin were damaged, he called his mother.
This alarmed her sister.
Together with her life-threatening brother, the 45-year-olds wanted to slow down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her life-threatening men.
On the street they encountered the man's ex-life threats.
When the two women re-examined the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and grabbed his ex-girlfriend.
Who makes Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens mean: investors are going to be much stronger in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes a "handling concept of residence" for the next meeting.
But the dispute is programmed.
In the first line it is about the question: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A scheme is still in progress.
SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the reasons: anyone who wants to build on urban areas needs to show 20 percent of all apartments in the future as social housing."
However, the cheap apartments can also be found in the warehouse.
However, the big point in the Council is: "How are you going with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent of these areas, but at least 20 per cent of the apartments can be built as social housing."
A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and must still be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The link still wants hard jobs for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann, a deterioration of the situation on the housing market was taking place.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the building management.
More personnel are needed.
It's unclear whether we'll get the experts.
However, the programme is still not complete: for about 1260 new apartments that should be built without being built.
But how do you compare the loss of about 1300 other cheap apartments, whose promotion will be carried out in the coming years?
Only 500 apartments will be available until 2020.
In order to prevent this, the planning political speaker Nicole Palm should now buy running connections from the city.
In addition, it was necessary to consider restoring apartments to the price chain.
That's possible in West City.
The problem was solved on one side.
Because the West city is running out of time for the next few years.
About 1800 apartments could be returned to the price chain for cheap apartments.
It's just that the owners don't want the housing companies.
Because the number of social housing in the West city is growing dramatically, one is away from the purpose of the so-called blending.
A concentration of social deficits in just a few parts of the city should no longer be given.
The reasons are that there will be still movement in the discussion.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must be on board."
However, they have focused on more construction sites for single families.
However, it does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that deserves
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been blamed by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go it's about to get people from the sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was first on the TV, then limited on video games and finally on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in the open do not go side by side.
I refer myself to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of characters, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture gave interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand began July.
The market introduction in other countries was transferred by the massive demand that the server overloaded.
Within less days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that will be followed with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photografted" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "caught".
A generation who played the game when she was younger closed the wagon and jumped to search for the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that bring back the "medium" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, said Washington Post recently that within two days after the introduction of the game, the number of people who have been trained every day will rise from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go - it's just seeing the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring to it "it takes 30 minutes to take time," "from sofa to be active" and "every day to be active" were focused on deaf ears, because many public messages about health are long-term and come from people who look breathless.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who pursue regular sports reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to apply here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in freedom that makes them fun.
As a result, three health cells are covered - movement, fresh air and sunglasses and fun.
Some people even end up having new friends on the hunt.
As there are always mysterious players who must always complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What are you gonna do?
There's been an explosion.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to run sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its journey and the use will end with time.
Because of Pokemons success, however, there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the active values in the real world and to help many people to be active, active, fat and healthy.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' rooms
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the spring.
It's impossible on the panel.
Attenuating on the ground.
On the whole bright line.
And now finally, too, the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American tournament rose on Thursday for multi-fighting and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the shadow of the Olympics.
Her total score of 62,198 was clearly front of the Silver Medal Winner and the "Final Five" Man's Camera by Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women, Simone Biles, turn on the swimming pool during the single-year battle of women in the arts tournaments at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Donnerstag.
Billes is the fourth heterosexual American who won a multi-fighting title and in total the five, while she determined her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She came out in trains when her final result was shown and her long journey was at this point to an end.
This success puts in the same League as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports species to new heights:
Billes has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of honor and precision that the 1984 Olympics of Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
It expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between cars and the rest of the athletes, but much more between them and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful gold would be viewed as a disappointment.
The American women, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, became upset after they won each gold and silver in the women's single-year battle final in the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles held the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a diplomat at the ruling party of the retired male coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Even though Bills were able to do this while their long way to the tops, never planning the future, that is not true.
A part of its underground circuits, which includes its typical tumbling pass, is based on Latin American music, which would fit home on the street outside of the Olympics in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament, was trained in the Boorman.
Since summer 2013, she has lost no more multi-fighting competition, a victory series that will be held as long as Billes wants.
Even if Mustafina was easily led by two directions, the image was taken away.
Swimming bars and basements - in which the world master title is held - painted.
Once again, with 15,433 on the Sweebe Bar - and with a 15,933 on the ground, she put another one on it.
Raisman greeted her mildly when she expected her end result - a pure form of training and trains flowed on bicycles glowing red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision she first described in her collection book was real.
The performance of Raismans was a race for the last time four years when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old male catacomb, named "Oma" by the Americans, had a prelude.
After her funeral, she went to the public Kosshende, overcome by a comeback, which sometimes appeared twice.
As for Billes, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19th year of the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 Victims shot in serial murder at the music audience in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most lethal attacks that have occurred in the first serial murder of Phoenix, while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a drive, the authorities said.
The driver fired eight shots of a gun, while standing on the driver’s side of the car and flying next to another vehicle, is to read in the report.
The police reported that the three-fold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that belonged to one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shipper had led the investigators to become a closer look at whether they were related to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed mostly in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more were killed.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is accepted that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown nose from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and were caused by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah are still dying in front of the scene.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was scheduled for half an hour before the three-phase murder, and it will be concluded that it was the work of the serial killer.
It found patterns and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephalie: "It's gonna be better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciutu loves the song, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Mikrozephalie, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Piccito, knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn't do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't get involved in it.
What doesn't agree at all -- of course you've got caught up in it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first answer to this was 'I didn't know the people were still doing,' explained Piccito.
Edmund can run with help.
until his third year, Edmund was unable to sit still and can't talk.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and drive.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has been thinking about for "Sing me something ahead of."
"We bring him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has found some characters alone.
Microzephalie has a number of causes: genetically, as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as Maserne or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the zikavirus.
Piccito remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I didn't expect her to tell me anyone.
But Piccito has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfalls, Overwhelming is allowed for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It will be counted the whole Saturday with more rain cases.
Many rivers in the south of Louisiana and the south of the Mississipis crossed their shores and flowed with large-scale overwhelmings after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to help the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparations of the Governor, shared that the demands for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangapahoa had requested tens of thousands of sandwiches.
An overwhelming warning system is used over a wide range of parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service allowed additional 3 to 5 duties to fall on rain in this area.
In southern Alabama, a river early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to be reported in the mobile area.
The River Committee near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekly record threshold.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both streams can accommodate many houses in the front areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stream-like overwhelming in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as they will only slowly flow over the river that is present in Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest point of 09.00 on Friday.
Rescue teams still tapped people from the river in the Amite and Wilkinson regions in the southwestern part of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his nephew were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the water from Beaver Creek, which normally lies more than 400 feet away from his house, increased strongly over the night.
He said that another son of a bitch who lived nearby had warned him.
"We are awake and the water flowed and flowed here," said Hansford.
I've got my talent.
His wife, Hansford, said that she had never seen such a height of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family had all the obstacles and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three of them in a large military LKW and had brought them to the next firehouse in Gloster, where they had been released until Friday.
Krautmann said that the overwhelming had "crowd spread rapidly" as heavy rains continued to occur and that the authorities were taking into account evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a visitor in the vicinity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning reported 13.75 toll rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly damaged by rainfalls since Wednesday.
The authorities pointed out that severe rain and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangapahoa Parish and educational disasters in five schools.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of Tangapahoa 200 overwhelmed homes were offered.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now overwhelmed.
The president of the municipality, Robby Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who had been seized by high water.
In the cities of Amit and Hammond, note rooms were set up to accommodate the evacuaters.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the town of Tangapahoa, almost two thousand roads were closed because of high water and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to take in, hoping to keep the water from their homes and businesses.
"The last big overwhelming we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said it was still on the golf course.
According to his comments, a handful houser should be reported on Thursday as over wet, but on Friday no one was reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "diluted by bullets", survived by boat in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia has been arrested this week for the second time that a 6-year-old child is arrested.
The boys' parents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The elders indicated that Brown had suffered several strokes, including in the country, legs, arms and bows, but that he had been in the hospital at the time of his transport.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was overcome by bullets," said his great mother, Delores Melendez to the messenger.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was critically established in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the messenger that he was expected to be welcomed back.
He was supposed to start the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were arrested in Germanytown.
Three men were also killed: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The young man was told at the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical state, reported.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were told whether they could be under one of the wounded men of the killers.
CBS Philadelphia reported that it seemed to have come to a crossfire between several shields.
Patterns for storm waves that have been subjected to various storm waves are transferred to the tatort.
There seems to have been a clear struggle in this regard.
On the street, on both sides of the wall, there are holes.
This seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the sender.
Several houses and vehicles were also found in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking reports following the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cheerleader on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She gets hurt and the police are looking for another suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I've been thinking about under the women's new team in the tournaments, and that's for more than a reason.
First, since 1984, I have been in every summer Olympics, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this man has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which have inspired other skin color girls.
The structure of this man, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is burning, makes everyone proud.
This man finally reflects the United States.
It confirmed the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female tournaments has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a wonderful Olympic winner and American youth.
Now the world was able to be witnesses of the incredible performance of the three world teachers Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but most powerful Gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won in an individual multi-fighting event for women gold.
Humanity member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the peaks of this sport type, but this is not the case in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all take the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into an Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the men. Besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality seems to be that tournaments are a valuable sport and tournaments are first held in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents, who come up with training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families). The list can be continued anyway.
The majority of these tournaments are in well-being, which can support the business.
In this union, the tournament receives its entire training and this is a valuable and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, a coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, a coach of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to make the communities more accessible and accessible to young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I've been building my tournament for 20 years.
At my events we have trained free and convenient tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Spanish) and national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the young high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from these great Olympic sports.
Tournaments develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers long-term benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this man to bring thousands of young girls to take an interest in the tournaments and that is great.
It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such a exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real performance of "Girl Power" through the oil of the Olympic Man Gold and thanks to so many young girls with different background to start their way, be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the staff of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in favour of the election.
In July, Hunt planned to force the contract into force and said that the NHS was in a "neighbor country" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants should receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve the care at an inappropriate time.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Committee on Assistive Doctors, said last night in a communication: "Assistants have more serious concerns about the proposed contract than before, in particular, that it will join the current community crisis and that it will be refused to treat all doctors properly."
In just eight weeks, which remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by means of talks have been made to participate in the government's return and sometimes on unwarranted weaknesses.
That was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made in the last month that his door would always be opened.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, raise the tension and respond to the care of the assistants."
If he does not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to take further action to combat the problem.
The last strike at the end of April saw an increase of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 terms, since nurses and professionals were involved in providing doctors with coverage on the strip-poster chain.
The Ministers hoped that the dispute on the changes could be resolved by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly allowance for 54,000 assistants subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, asked the assistants to finish the strike.
Mortimer said: "Employment measures are not only limited, but are already overcharged teams and service providers and provide patients, caregivers and their families only with care, care, care and interruption."
In the last two months, we have talked to the Committee of Assistants and spoke to the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries positively about the concerns of the Presidency and the Whistblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as dispatch, flexibility in education, additional training for those who returned from a professional period, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational plan, continuing training leave and gender-specific pay in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was that the employer, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were in respect of compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart rate
Thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after being recommended by the authorities to use this more people for a longer period of time.
The use of the medicinal product Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart disease for people with a heart disease.
The medicine is already taken 12 months after a heart attack, thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year adoption to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year adoption to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 120,000 people suffer from heart disease each year and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of solid materials in the arterial walls forming the premises.
If the mixture is mixed, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the flow of blood to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
When the blood vessels are dissolved, it can flow through the blood stream and the flow of blood to the brain that causes a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at greater risk for another.
Ticagrel, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood vessels unlikely.
The NICE manual, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrel followed by 60mg with a double daily intake of Aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of secondary prevention, there are a quarter of all people who have experienced heart disease, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have a major negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with Aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and injuries in people who already had a heart attack.
Through a temporary recommendation from Ticagrelo, we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options available to thousands of people who can benefit from them.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrel is limited to a period of up to three years, and the guidance draft does not recommend any treatment extending over this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Lets the elections flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the office last year by a government report on corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is clearly ignored as a devastating government report has been published today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is urging the police, electoral observers and councillors to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to "consensibilitys with regard to Ethnie and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Community Government, now an anti-corruption king, said that it would be so bad for the prosecution of voters from religious motives that the police should be allowed to set up blockades outside electoral cabinets to protect protected voters.
He recommends that voters take a look at themselves in order to prove their identity in the elections.
In time, a elector must only name his name and address.
The report suggests that no remote ink should be placed on a person's finger if they give out their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistblower should get more protection, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the press to have more access to Community data and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against electoral fraud, but also the municipal government should protect against the wider corruption and financial exploitation culture that is involved in this," he said.
The report was organized by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court decided that the official mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be subjected to corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had made the religious feelings of his Muslim community "sinically and in a way perverted" and that he had brought his critics to their knees with racist and Islamic accusations.
Rahman should have "leaded his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubled or the result of an arrest, in which one person chose as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the denial of the letter - in the elderly members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, formed, made several recommendations to strengthen the electoral system, including the leadership of exhibitions to prove identity.
In his report, it says: "It has been shown that pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities has been exercised, particularly women and young people, to choose, according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"It was thought that... state institutions had deliberately ignored such behavior because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity with regard to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to maintain the system, including the ban on the processing of political activists' patents to stop "valuations".
The report, drawn up by Theresa May, also requires further registration checks to prevent the use of the list of options for immigration and social consumption.
Take note of options to ask voters before choosing your display.
No removeable ink on a person's finger, as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter error.
It is prohibited for political activists to make complete mistakes in letters and in exchange for mistakes in letters.
The police have the authority to set up suspensions for electoral stations.
An amendment to the law which facilitates the prosecution of a petition under the representative of the People Act 1983 (People's Rescue Act 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
A requirement that only English can be used at the election stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees apply the rule that voters go to the election booth alone.
Sir Eric falls across the Metropolitan Police and finds it "extremely" that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges have been filed.
"The election court has explained that Luther Rahman and his representative, for the sake of a Lithuanian, are guilty of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty of a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure.
He also criticises the unimplemented "back controls" of the electoral departments of the councils.
Sir Eric said: "The court hearing in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliament, is a proud heritage, but the caregiving and widespread expansion of elections and the denial of certain authorities threaten this good reputation.
Delayed by Kates Radler Double Players and other famous Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been told this week about the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the border and band, which has proved to be an impressive double player of Cambridge's heart.
But the 24-year-old Olympics are not the only athlete to fight for gold, which is the most famous double player - at least not if you can give social media faith.
To honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently filming on our screens, F.C. has created a list of Olympics that show more than a certain similarity to Hollywood.
The Jäger and the Wolf: a member of the US-man in the Bogenschichteen Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kates double passengers on the railway, many people on the Internet showed how a certain bong protection of the twinling of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The U.S. Men's crew in the Bogenschichteen, Brady Ellison, has caused an attack on Twitter after seeing pictures that he sees relatively similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the protection of the bogey was able to drive into the social media, and it made sense that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see any great similarity myself, except face storage," Brady shared with Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking kernel, so I'm going to put it on as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take place this year in the middle of the year: the striking similarity between the British extender Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, expressive eyes is supposed to be a double player for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African Swimmer Cameron van der Burge has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One goes up: This user is the view that Nathan is the "aesthetic version" of the inception player
A further steady comparison was drawn between Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, similar to heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-burned skin and blue hair like the actor Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian of Fans is certified to be like a "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Strong Women: Footballstar Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others have also experienced the similarities
Theory Set in the Room: According to this user there may be a reason for the equality of the couple
A Twitter user stated her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter have a similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh Jennings and her bedrooms, which is almost identical to the artist Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the tournament, Gabby Douglas, who features her own beautiful, wide bedrooms, similar to the one of the Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentant for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese Swimmer "as a pig is dead"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m Free-Swissing Table of CBC Live Transfers of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian sender CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese skimmer "as a dream" and during the race as "a woman died".
Commentary Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave up his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-zeal.
MacDonald, who was taken into the CBS Commentary on board to give more "color", could say, "This 14-year-old Chinese lost the connection, baby."
Upstairs, gone like a dream, died like a pig.
Thank you.
The Chinese Swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, dropped the second stage of the swimming pool 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds longer than Canada Taylor Ruck, which enabled the Canadians to complete the success of China.
Visitors throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane second, "The CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old skimmer from China "as if a pig had died" ?????
The idiot didn't realize that they were still sending."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-of-life dropboard for women as follows: "This 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald came on Twitter quickly and hard, with many talking to him
Twitter users didn't stand back when they heard how insignificant Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC's transmission, said live for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologize that the comment on a swimming performance has been deleted."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, it makes us sorry it happened."
CBC found herself guilty of over 90 times at the end of the people who responded to the comment on Twitter
The rapporteur, Mr Russel, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about the comments of MacDonald
The network also quickly apologized and received a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible to be expelled.
Yesterday night we were quickly accused of sending our visitors and our followers to the social media.
To clarify, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the Swimmer and not to them as a person.
However, they were inadequate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald was accused of sending and tried to justify his remarks by claiming that it was not his intention to be subjected to a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to excuse myself for the comment I made after the female washing machine in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I've been on the service of the Swimmer and not on them as a person."
Of course, there was no misgivings, and I'm sorry."
Buyers in Primark are hired by a woman who is tested in the middle of the business for free of charge
The buyers did not know where they should look when a woman dressed in a primordial dress to try underhouses.
In order to make the situation worse, she had to look at it, she left and put it back in the Kingdom.
She continued to break up and tried four couples underhosen in a business in Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkeston.
The Primark Business in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkeston, in which the woman approved the Underhoses before she returned to the Kingdom
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the undercover, "she went back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sale area, she took a couple underhosites out of the exhibition, took out her own shrubhouses and houses and tested them.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place to do it - she stood there just like Oskar."
"Every one stared when they re-emerged the underhospitable which they had apparently not fallen because they put them back into the realm."
She repeated the same with three more underhospitations before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, then she went back and disappeared.
"They didn't seem to disturb that they watched anyone - or think about the person who would buy the underhouses that they had approved."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How foolish it would be to think that someone would take under house with another person who was arrested and not washed."
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I came along, the employees have tried to remove the clothing items from the sale after they went - what is really good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new couple of underhospitals and find out that another woman grabbed them and pulled them out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9th in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products concerned were taken from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks With Krav Maga
The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We're talking to Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga League in New York to find out how you're surrounded by armed robbers on a close-up.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the mirror for your driver.
If you're hurt by your back, you should turn first so that you can see your attackers and "go out of the board line," says Mirzrachi.
Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free ellbogen face.
So hit him with the knife into the chest and you drag him while the attacker assembles himself in front of pain, the gun out of his hands. Hit him in the face and move back as the weapons are directed against him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shell line, grab the gun and destroy it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, lower the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then drag the weapon out of his grip before they move back and turn the weapon on him.
Sounds hard?
Watch the video to see exactly how it shapes Mirzrachi.
But think it's safe to spend your money on a robbery unless you're a maga master.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his voice for a tour guide at the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveler undertook his immune system and würgerflex a serious test - by turning some of Europe's most dirty and self-sustained places.
The Moderator and Traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, created his train on a Euro-Speech, a country on Piccadilly Circus, a train-tip button and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before the look of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would fit on.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Intern Strength", brought some surprising results.
The thought that the trigger button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally absent, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen game.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical experts about the promotion of dentists and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left him, more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his dreams by traveling through the world with his own and wonderful things.
From public countries on railway stations to trailers, the task of the immune system was definitively tested.
In the film he said: "I was already a child relatively unafraid about my health, and I have put all possible things in my mouth, Earth, Wurmer and Slamm water."
In the film he was called in any case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test sample showed a luminometer number of more than 4,000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to take off after his Luminometer count had dropped over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands showed one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Internal Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the film he says, "That's the worst thing I've ever had in a toilet."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to pick up anything here because it's stuck inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company takes Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains milk sugar bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of breast bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Weeks and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We led crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in dynamite health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of evil health and how they relate to the immune system.
The growing interest in breast health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information on it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's reign, added: "Let me tell you so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had eaten some of the things that I showed him, like the half Russian toilets shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to pick them up and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we took some of these dirty jokes on film."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of all milk sugar bacteria questioned, in particular with the benefit of Magen and Darm and 58% said that they used at least occasionally products containing added milk sugar bacteria.
Asiole family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An associative family left their social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were shot after a long list of complaints of their presence in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were forcibly removed from their presence, shocked employees of the housing company found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed striking holes, wood parts were lifted up, powder was spread on the ground and graphiti was cut to the walls.
The family was surrounded and it will be accepted that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the household administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said: "There was an absolute album for the people here, and I see that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this presence may be seen as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is upset and her call is also true.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment at the same time, and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball players, kidnappers from residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, fights and flows.
Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the rent contract, was awarded an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that will be removed under conditions, old furniture was found
It was in the presence in which drugs were used in the past, the wood parts were removed.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and they had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing gave her and her partner this week violently out of existence after giving them an extended 11-week period to be released voluntarily.
Delogation was doubled by simplified neighbors who said that her life was made for hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say the police here are unbelievable.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Hausing, said that it would have prevented the family from cooperating with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were regularly called, 20 years ago
On the upper side of the community house, furniture and old toys were destroyed
He added: "It is a shame that the renter refused to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, since a delegation is always the last step the Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, since the conduct was extremely extreme and their actions had to be severely misrepresented for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community have done and have allowed us the information.
I hope that this development will contribute to some neighboring trust and the message that antisocial attitudes will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house for different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty matrice left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the floor
Workmen of the household will now have to remove müllberges that surround the house
In 2014, the police drove a Razzia into the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as waagen, paraphernalia and barge in excess of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after he had been convicted of possession of a drug in Class B.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who came to life in 2013.
After they were unconscious, Tanya and her partner will now live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Many rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.
The police say they're going to delegate to tenants who don't respect the rules of the house.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall's police told me that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not respect the rules.
"This applies to those who think they can take no advantage of themselves and those who have been harmed by such conduct," she said.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Travellers in Portugal in Panik after crossing a deeply fledgling military beach
Sunglasses in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft left an incredible crash flight
Air combat forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but required that no safety risk be presented.
This was the moment to start in panic in the busy tourist resort, after a deep-floating jet jolted over a full beach.
Dramatic video captures showed how the military aircraft was almost more sensitive to the sun’s rays on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The runners wake up when they clearly begin to worry about the heat of the dücentreebwerks without first seeing what happens to them through the clouds.
The event took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many runners who posted videos on the dramatic flight-by in the social media, said: "Flag is twice too deep, and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just on the surface and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly deep flight
The Portuguese Air Force today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats at the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only possibility to recognize them.
The speaker said that because of the bad visual conditions, the jet was much deeper than the usual flight, but the air force needed to ensure that safety was not compromised at any time.
Land fires have destroyed this summer part of the Portuguese mainland, where four people on the island of Madeira were also killed.
The Portuguese Air Force today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong nebel and brandy - which limited his view.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boat had to be identified as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first time in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans stand in the duol around the Spanish Supercup against the FC Seville, the return game is three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner has to abandon the European League champion, among other things, in the exercise of power with the under-priced Cupfinlists and the ruling European League champion, who competes with Brazil for the Olympic Football tournament.
Moreover, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing from the stairs.
In training, the Germans experience a banding in the neck, which explains at least the request of Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter steps have been legalized in Barcelona for two years around the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far failed to make a clear decision and has placed Bravo in the League, but Ter steps in most of the other bids.
Before the first game of the new game, there is doubt at the Spanish master about the fitness status of the man who was demoted on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the sample gallery against Samdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really believe it.
Sevilla once again has the 2:3 new situation after enlargement in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is a record winner in this competition with up to eleven success.
Ma long in a private league to table gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table Olympic player.
The 27-year-old met on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a unique finale of his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4.4).
As a result, the World Ranking List First held the Golden Grand Slam with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have done it as expected in the final game and have become the title of each other.
Thus it was clear that the third time a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on top of the Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ-legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the platform, between the seats and time-outs they had no coaches.
They had returned to the tribunes and left their guards alone in the fair fight.
"The matches I've played for my country to this day."
"In the end I play for me," Zhang had rightly said.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners won with the Chinese fans.
The match itself was unexpected.
Mother had only to fight with her 28-year-old opponent in the first sentence.
He then determined the time on the plate and left Zhang from there only 13 points in total.
Through Ma's over-reliance, the expected match did not develop.
However, they were not able to see enough airstrips.
Mizutani won the Bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samson 4:1.
In his fourth final against the German European Master Dimitry Ovccharov, the white Russian had been subjected to a seizure, then in medical treatment, he had to be "last" with blech.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) were in relatively high tiers of Olympics.
Donald Trump solves general problems in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is subject to massive concerns, even in traditional conservative federal states.
The presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave his election campaign to the former Republican Highsburg Utah.
A rare moment, in which the normally large and self-sacrifice multibillionaire, who appeared in general, reported something like thoughts, like correspondence.
After he threw 16 rivals inside his own republican camp from the race, the doubts of his success grew around the white house.
"We have serious problems in Utah," said Trup to evangelical Christians, who asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Should there be false reports about his candidate, he re-entered his famous media sources.
Watch Republican Highsburgs
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.
A survey by SurveyUSA from June followed by Trump and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions, however, do not look forward to the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the Federal State.
As a threat, Arizona and Georgia are also affected.
In an interview by the CNBC sender, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the Marsh Clintons again: "Yes, as I have done before."
And create later: this will be either "be successful or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday".
He's not doing anything but telling the truth.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, it is all right, Trup further said.
Then I go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party should have threatened to throw money in support of its election fight, and it should not be able to present any better environmental impact.
Instead, it is the desire to strengthen the candidate countries for the Congress.
Olympia: Dryness at Doping Test
The IOC wishes to establish a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's Leichtteläten played the second doping match at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemeach.
After a funeral test at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan officer had reported that the former Sprinter and current Coach, John Anzrah, had issued an Urin trial under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.
This was reported by Kenya's team leader Doping controllers.
The international association IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to carry out its own investigations, a IAAF speaker shared with him.
" Depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IOC, the IOAF will be assessed," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to Doping Control Station and was released as Ferguson Rotich, issued and signed the trial," Kenyas Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was born in 2015 in Beijing WM-Fierter over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Leichtteltelik delegation leader Michael Rotich was removed from Rio games.
He should have informed his country of ongoing doping tests against cash payments.
As a result, media reports should be taken on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special care for many doping processes in the IOC for a long time.
In the announcement of the IOC more than 2000 doping target controls in front of the Rio games, it was unusual to suggest that special athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the audience.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping gesture and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of Olympics.
As a result, WADA Kenya was taken from the list of countries whose doping struggle is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya is a great race of runners.
The country's lighthouses won most of the medals at the 2015 WM in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports of the ARD, there was always a strong demand for easy access to Kenya Doping medium and a significant mentality of the sport consumption.
IOC member Richard Pound asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had conducted it in the Russian lighthouse.
This could prove that this type of sport has been widely and systematically baptized.
Russia's Lightballs were thus excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With this, a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
Salzburg is the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and filled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchester, under the direction of the Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel, "This music is full of rhythms", he laments.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in her time and her melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this essay Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers with emotion her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because she's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright."
So she's smart, of course she's naive, and very patient.
"She looks very much like me, my Italian character, which I have as a novelist," Bartoli says.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecelia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a privilege to work with her.
She's an unimaginably great man.
And Bartoli repeats the compliment: "Dumamel is such an extraordinary artist and very patient!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his views, it's his life!
It is such a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperature, a fire, patience, and also a happy way of life, which is absolutely very important!
For U.S. Director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly current: "In this piece it is about advantages and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, the Puerto Ricans have gone to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
There are the same topics, and they are as strong today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirls who joined the IS were murdered in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who last year left London to join the IS, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family experienced her death a few weeks ago in Raqq, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqq, the ballwork of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-affected country and return to England.
"I can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people will stop making this decision every time," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultanas family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a white man within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a voter at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will be nominated by Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his appointment by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is of the opinion that the next president will be appointed to the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a telephone conference on Thursday that he expected to select Garland "with a certain degree of consciousness".
A speaker from Reid later said he wouldn't have talked to Clinton if she'd named Garland and speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Raid said that the Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were Lakes and assistants of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also concluded that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the President's office.
Treats wants a Christmas calendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine works together with photographer David Bellemer to produce a Peruvian inspired calendar for 2017 in the 1970s.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museum calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his Christmas magazine of Old School-Playboys was different since "Playboy is for men".
I'll do it for women.
He seems to have the view that the calendar is doing the same.
"We have to go back to show timeless and classic pregnancy, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful art work.
Models can access their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality calculated by mass flight
"If you don't fit and praise Erdogan, you're sitting on packed suitcases," says the President of the Golden-Night Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany is short-term with tens of thousands of asylum seekers who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the meantime, it could even be "a hundred thousand", according to the president of the Alliance, Ali Toprak.
Because of the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the Putschtest, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I will count with tens of thousands, on average with a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Alliance President Ali Toprak of the World on Friday.
Since the government had already taken over Kurdian Hochburg with sanctions months ago, there were 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey on the flight.
After the ruined powder, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a country that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Head of Defence accused the intended possession of Syrian Arab in Kurdish, but also in alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining curves.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been excommunicated or sold over the past hundred years," said Toprak, also a member of the CDU.
The Federal Government claimed that the German government "as far as Austria was concerned about Erdogan and its allies".
Also in Germany there is a "hexenjagd" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German twinge of the Golden Movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turkey will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
The branding as a golden fan destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"If anyone does not adjust and praise Earthgan, it is on packed boxes, as well as on the chemical and sculptors," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Golden-Night Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the press reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Turks have already represented the largest group of asylum-rights in Germany, recognized as a result of political persecution.
By Friday, June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all people were entitled to asylum (39,625).
In this collection, the victims of war, poverty or despondency cannot be found.
Asyl entitled under the principle of law are purely political, hence by state side, individual persecution.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it goes"
Selsam Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The natives do not have anything from the summer election struggle with - and the runners from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understand.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer fairs, the Swedish Parliament has already decided on the beginning of the year.
For more than until then it is not: summer fairs, heats, and day-to-day elections - that is what is happening.
The natives to be persuaded by the electoral strugglers are on vacation.
The most important passengers in the country, on the road to Usedo, Rügen or Hidensee, are not native, so they cannot choose the day of the country.
There are practical problems: In the holidays, help is to stop the posters, blow balloons, distribute planes, and choose to vote at the end of the voting.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and the final holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to go through the people almost once again.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And there is something about it: Prime Minister Erwin Selering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.
It will be exciting how strong Newling AfD breaks down and what remains at the end of the coalition table.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, the head of government, makes a nearly independent election campaign, looks from its big spots.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and pulsates a little with the people, as it has already done his legendary warlord Harald Ringstorff.
On the other hand, Selering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel owes to the flowering of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, which "we created it" has accelerated the rise of lawmakers, which may now be costing him the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its top candidates, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are at the wrong time at the right place of election.
She has invited two Chancellor Angela Merkel to college; Merkel is a Bundesag selection centre in the north.
But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxons as Mecklenburgers and Prepommers.
"There was probably a majority of other German countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also harms no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
On the other hand, the Nordic CDU largely ignores the normal choice of market sites and before shopping centers with sunscreens and balloons.
That, that's what I mean, cokert, is just another "subordinated role."
The Union has also noted that it has broken down the base on the country that it has to work very hard to find a way back to the people.
You're going like the left, the SPD, the green: there's hardly any place in the country's borders.
However, the Council of the CDU electorate Kokert to its opponents is also self-contained: "They must go wherever they are, that is where people are: Villages, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is on the game, Selering has now called his SPD into a particularly engaged election fight.
The social democracies last questioned with 22% behind partner CDU (25) and only shortly before the AfD (19).
In 2011 the SPD was still clear with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small parties with seven percent in the polls, should create the spring in the country day.
They make a modern train from the holiday note and place their choice in large parts of the Internet.
"Online elections", it is called the president of the country Claudia Müller.
On the other hand, green electoral fighters are looking for local citizens among the passengers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just runs a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Seas and finds it still beautiful.
Your impression: "Wald leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-sanning: tormenting guest posts under suspension
At the speed with which B 27 is handled, there is nothing to be confused.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 20 a.m., there is always praise.
"They've made everything quite shaky," says Elvira Tetzloff from the Jet dance station.
That's a super team.
There's no objection either.
The construction site was able to be gradually moved to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October.
It is also believed that the conference will be held by the construction manager, as far as it is concerned with the establishment of aid schemes.
Since the construction of the building on Monday to the south, and also the break up of the Aspergstraße in Ofteringen, and thus the connection to Rottenburg, the transport history has been slowed down within the place.
The citizens can now proceed in two ways from the B27.
The transport of goods by the place seems to go back.
"There were some major complaints," said the chief executive director, Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the sanitation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatsstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic skills because many of them were looking for bad roads and trusted their ship more than the description.
What caused some Lkw to freeze in residential areas.
Since the speed limits have not been met, the Community requested strengthening of the measuring vehicle from mossingen.
"It gave significant advances," says King, who made himself aware of the situation even before.
There have been two to three minutes left.
The fastest was in the Tempo-30 Zone with 77 hours of miles.
Since the construction site has been removed, however, it has become quieter.
For business people at the B 27 it is only a small trust that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27-scanning has led them to trade interruptions, let anyone ask.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end-users", so they produce for other companies, for which the treatment has little consequences.
Also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest light return", but also suggests that of course "the driving science is lacking".
The most powerful are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, holder of the Steakhouse, originally Krone, finds some significant words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not just him, but all the guesthouses had hit it.
It was missing customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
It refers to 'more than 50 per cent'.
The road repair has "returned back for two years".
Half of his employees had to let him go.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, the President of the Government, Jörg Schmidt, asked whether there could be a financial balance, with the indication that guests would benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. Now they also have to bear the consequences of the treatment.
Gohnner knows from other circles where something bigger has been kept.
In all complaints, Ghohnner is sure that his guesthouses will continue.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.
He can understand that the rest of the guests are now less often overlooked because of the complicated traffic.
If you can't drive, it's nice.
That his family client returns to the end of the healing work, there is no doubt about it.
Despite the crisis with BSE and bird arrests, Göhner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientship for the biggest crisis that his guest stations have experienced in their long-term history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, legislation is regularly violated.
Following the latest attacks, Minister de Maizière is now offering a thick security package.
But what does a state of terror have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of it?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Versöhner.
All its proposals will be "politically humourable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't ask anyone.
Other further points would be discussed first within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
However, as a interior minister, he had results and a "intended conscience" within the coalition.
After the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière allowed a little time to present his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now much more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, quoted: that a new security authority should care for the bones of key communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU operations on flight data and the law of arms.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière begins a second round of proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to apply for sympathy for terrorist groups and to cut down the German passports with dual citizenship.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he held this to be ridiculous and demanded nothing of the coalition partner without any chances.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have partly in mind: He plans fast procedures for discharges and more possibilities for arresting people before abortion.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of claims for disbursed asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as committing crimes or withdrawing their papers in order to break their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally void.
Some are still unexplained and can open questions.
And at some point - when treating those who are patient, for example, the question arises: What does it really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to distinguish between refugee issues and terrorism.
But it can't be said that the athletes of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about safety in view of the high refugee numbers.
And the things that people are so busy do not even get out in election times.
Internal security is enormously focused.
First the arrivals in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is big.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly concerned with internal security.
In the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.
First of all, there is a sharp dispute about the provision of the Federal Police, and then about a political collection of security ideas by a minister of the Union, in which the Heads of State also demand a Burka ban and a withdrawal from the dual state citizenship.
The Maizière also has to do with the fallible tone.
He didn't keep anything from getting away from the double pass.
We have welcomed the debate in Germany.
You can't make it any more sense.
And at a Burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutionally binding on all corners and whether it is really "sustainable" for the coalition partner, it must be shown first.
There's a few ways in which you can make a fight.
However, the SPD is now also trying to profile its internal security.
Sigmar Gabriel, a member of the party, signals carefully and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security".
People's cars are still moving smoothly.
Despite Diesel Canals, the number of deliverys is increasing worldwide.
But not all markets run around.
There is a verb about a term in the recuperation.
People's cars start with deliverys held in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can still produce a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-run markets in the past year.
In July, however, the VW nuclear market was weakened mainly in Western Europe and recharged the total sales, as reported in the Dax.
The brand VW sold worldwide in July with 449100 cars with 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, according to China's second most important market, sales are 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany’s home market, the delivery was almost six months away.
Mr. Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers back to Europe on two sales days less.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic framework conditions" have given rise to sales retention.
In addition to the situation around the Turkish dust test, a speaker explained that the British vote on exit from the EU had also taken place.
In the United States, where the exhaust fumes first scaled up, there is also a minus to book.
Great aid for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the main domestic market in the Netherlands is still flexible through the diesel canal: after the first seven months, only a reduction in delivery of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles will be booked.
Mr. Fred Kappler was able to maintain a sales surplus from January to July.
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered by public cars at this time, the world over 5,904 million.
People's cars were manipulating with a software waste.
Only in Germany, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion to workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the construction of the car had no negative effects.
Following the conversion of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance.
After the conversion, the automaker produces a "guarantee" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it did in business circles on Friday.
The reason was the legal features.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen guaranteed its German customers yet now a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This had been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
This meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport.
"VW must fully comply with my investigation commission and the KBA."
"The differences are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that no damages have occurred after the conversion of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance and that all type-approval-related vehicle values are unchanged.
People's cars themselves do not use the term "protection" as it did in business circles.
In the broad concept of "protection" Volkswagen sees the possibility, for example, that customers will come to a workshop about half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste canal, to ensure that possible insurance schemes are guaranteed, as they did.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "protection".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegersee requires many savings in future punishments - as the second institution in Germany.
The bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see any sign in it: Normal savers must "not be afraid to pay for their spargro penalty".
Savings Banks Money at night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0.4 per cent of the penalty.
This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of private and company customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros to cash or cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros in the year," said Paul.
He had been spending 40 million euros a day on the others and could not be valued.
"They are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs," said the bank chief.
"I can't afford 4000 euros for every million."
The costs are now in line with the consumer principle.
It would be too dangerous to leave the bar money in the trusts of the Raiffeisen Bank: "I've already experienced four cases, I don't want the fifth!" said the Bank Board.
Most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of installation.
Only a few traveling to other banks.
The Bayern Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs to all banks."
You can't be "business" alone.
Some German banks have therefore increased their accounts, credit cards or transfers fees.
The Thuringer Volks and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Country has made its Skatbank Fimile 2014.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect that private customers will have to pay flat-rate payments for investment, that is, the competition in Germany is too strong under banks and savings."
A banker said, in the tender view, there is "a client equipped with something more complicated from the property".
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if they were free of money.
The 1911-founded Society Bank Gmund has double-sized facilities in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egers, Kreuth and Tegersee.
In the region, prominent players, athletes and entrepreneurs lived.
The Bayern Association "there are no other banks currently known to calculate an exposure rate for private customers," said speecher Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fréhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative against the private customer is very, very high".
Competitiveness is hard, and it leads to the disappointment of employees to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be allowed to fall into this category.
Destination plates: who actually buys shilling plates?
Single men in middle age love discs.
Before you go to the comment section to transfer it under Pseudomym notAllOne manMitlersAlders with raw instructions, this statement is based on current data.
According to YouGov, the multi-lingual recovery of shell plates is not on a tree in millenniaals who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but return to Midlife Nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are all expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is also not a word by Hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older shoppers maintain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog had a message on the TV, the camera would follow me while I was walking through a business street in Soho, carrying a certain green approach and stuking wild before I stand, holding my hands and saying something specific like, "So, let us take a closer look at it."
So let us take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly enters his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which the first independent sellers were present - there is still a great deal of paper business ahead of hand.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such businesses and try to appreciate their age and humor by observing them.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, where I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into recordless records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20, is a long day due to a meeting in London and goes through business to complete the few hours.
Is he a collector, I'm asking?
"I already appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These glass plates, painted above (he has sent me the chat room via e-mail, I have not followed him to his house), the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appear and buy again items that he sold when he was young and suffering.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appear when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably too young to buy me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are more introverted and prefer to spend their time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my load.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old plates again.
The discussions I conducted have usually ended in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their plates first to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he says.
This would explain the tree to attach to the surface of a particular age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to realize that record shops offer a relaxing community of equal rights.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a stand on the contact-free payment system.
Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of trusted cardboard holes, from objects that generate happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or possession of a material owner as a sort of trust," Wez says.
That's what it's like with me as a collector, and I think it's with many people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" a staff member bursts out of a plate stopper.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard of it.
The survey also found that 41% owned a disc player they never used, while 7% of those buying a disc do not own a disc player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried while I was looking at a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who worked at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age), noticed a "trophynasity" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio head card so I can put it in order," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, who just come slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost a whole floor to the glass plate, has a more interesting audience than I do.
There are couples around the 70, tourists, photomakers, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned businesses - Wildeasts is the newest synthesis and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz comes from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look special, but after psychological traumas are difficult to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running here for a few minutes and takes into account the variation of the plates for sale.
She's making a mirror bomb instead of a big purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in some other way, but the beauty of plates is..." she runs off with a loved driver.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I gave the chance to sample the Jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of teenage girls grouping around Polaroid Cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter passed away to buy a crossley board player.
On the left is a wooden house, a wall full of tablets from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some up to as far as it is impossible to accept them.
It's pure flat art.
But in view of the fact that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a group of people who have more time and money than others are also those who spend most of their time and money on luxury items such as plates.
Even if my research has found that the results of YouGov agree, they will at least take account of the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record and online.
These people may work hard at school or in offices.
They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bubbles through Berwick Street's flats and the leaves through the plates, while they make the look of a mysterious, 30-year-old false moderator, who does not attract any strange middle-aged men over the shoulders.
The Greenlandhai is the longest live animal - Video report
Scientists say that Greenland has the longest life span of all wild animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examined the Haie, says that the record was with a female, from the point of view that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court of Justice makes tenders for cancellation of operations in Dschungel refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to lower tens of thousands of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a trial, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should have the power to lower 72 provisional stores in which persons are sold from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer free services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a couple of euros in provisional restaurants.
The President Calais argued that these places should be reduced because they would represent a parallel economy, which would not be taxed and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that business and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also indicated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the issue of people operating the 72 provisional business, but concluded that the doubts of the president of Calais "are absolutely beyond scope."
Rector Jean-François Molla said that food business, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply eating people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet spots between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which will be operated jointly and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to verify the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the conclusion "would be for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are. "
The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in Dschungellar had increased to over 9,000 - the highest number up to now - after a steady increase in neonatals during the summer.
Despite the Olympics: Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disturbing appearance in the Olympics, Rod Prof. Tony Martin does not want to get involved.
"I keep the WM in mind, remain confident and fight further," wrote the 31st-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have a statement for his miserable twelfth place in the sugar house.
"I find it really hard to comment on the timing of the morning," Martin said.
He had to analyze in peace what reasons he had for debakel.
At the time-WM in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight the title.
"I'll look at everything exactly what we've changed in the past."
"This is also my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who lost in the middle of the week 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympics Fabian Cancella (Switzerland).
Olympics: Tennis Prof. Siegend versus Half-final
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the fourth final of Rio: The World Range List-32. from Metzingen passed by 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.

Group increases at start-up for live video video transmissions
Other people are looking at video games, and it's a resort - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology company buys the start-up beam that has specialized on this Hobby.
As much money for the acquisition flows, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but you can also impress yourself.
For example, they can give the players missions and deliver enemies as well as equipment items.
The playerial activity Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already rising.
The staff of the start-up, who has so far been in Seattle in Washington, U.S. state, are taking to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam Founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi reported.
Therefore, no change should be made to customers by taking over.
Beam is integrated around the Xbox console according to Microsoft in the video game department.
The market for live streaming video games is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google-Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Racer needs to set itself on the next generation speed meter: in various German countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which will allow the temperature sensors to be more effective.
For example, the future-acting enforcement trailer of Wiesbaden can be used for example on emergency points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on road construction sites or on sanitating bridges with an excess temperature, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that there is a stational browser for the maintenance of the speed limit.
But a long-term mobile building can be too dangerous or exciting.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days of uninterrupted measurement operation, the fall data will be transmitted via a modem.
In addition, Laser Mestechnik can simultaneously detect all vehicles over multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans by time, train and vehicle classes can also be monitored.
In high-speed mode, you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with attachment coupling.
In order not to be easily charged, he has been reduced in the measurement operation, so that the wheels will disappear in the pendant and the rest of the safe outer wall.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the viewer from vandalism.
Since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to what is stated by Vitronic in various German countries and is still being used.
Foreign authorities will also stay with the new technology: Youth has ordered France 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
Britain holds silver in the 7th corner, after Fiji Masterclass Gold holds
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby came at the end of Thursday evening at the end of the last hall in the form of the Fiji, when they were hit by a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji distributed a master class in the handing, side-stepping, back-up, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The Netherlands was devastated by the low price of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The major download of the boxes, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have killed a 15-man team in the best form of this form.
It could be a trust for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way back.
Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one thing they're losing.
This battle will be fought, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started to be wonderful and let the GBs attack out of space.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as one would run in a racing bus. The world series winners went up to 5-0 as Osea Colinisau in the corner.
With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai launched another attack from the right corner he turned.
12-0 and GB almost caught the ball.
An outstanding touch of Mitchell stopped making the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third tower, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremallau entered the right corner a showerdown and stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one from the re-enfiff and it was still over a minute game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovovo visited the GB team by further weak tackling and jumped up to the line to make a door.
The conversion took a 29-0 to break.
It's like Fiji was born to play 7 while GB is still learning.
That's right.
GB led fundamental changes to half-life and finally the fiscal success...for all four minutes, which was good for the relationships of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova passed out after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton began an attempt for GB, made a tuchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already in the favor of the southern islanders, whose fans sang, raced and dancing on the tribune.
It wasn't hard to admire the player's approach to Fiji.
Mata Williams set the i-tubples with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff died, the Fijis fell asleep and GB kicked down in the race.
Earlier on the day, Fiji had won Japan in the semifinal with 20-5 and South Africa forced South Africa into a narrow semifinal match from the race - the United Kingdom's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown carried the boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footing and built a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant later tanking by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-Aside team, assured the winner - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by a struggle with the cancer of the trainer for the race.
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what it wants to mean.
From the first to the last, 220 hearts of Hiev, who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were sitting on the wheel, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams was all-embracing when they rode on the second Olympic gold in two without a rating woman, the first women in the history of the British sport who placed such a level.
Her domain was absolutely, always her 39th uncomplicated use, which is also exemplary.
What we see are two brilliant Athletics that look over the surface with the elegance of snow, which does not reflect the type of triumph to the knees.
After every gold in the mine, a battalion belongs to volunteers who contribute to the progressive progress that makes the difference, and it was no more helpful than the trainer who didn't know if he would ever survive this day when cancer was diagnosed with him.
Like he said, there was a risk.
I had explosives, which is operable, and they did it.
If you don't, he'll spread out.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It changes the look a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he was able to start his treatment in early 2014, outside the season, what kept the interruption to a minimum, if it was the right concept under such circumstances.
I needed the money, so I had to get better soon.
It's been a while.
I was in the hospital and loved the station here - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudering is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.
In the immediate vicinity of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something else and tried to work out his own concerns.
Stanning, who was head of the Royal Artillery Regime in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional joke this week. That might be something extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much this means to me, how much Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so thanks go to him. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.
The couple had a strong rhythm that their opponents could not bear.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started, Stanning and Glover had too many reservations.
We were arrested very much at the moment.
Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to let go of it.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't about to make some jokes.
We didn't want a fire today, we just wanted to achieve good results, get out and win the race, what we did too.
The couple will take a period of time for a year before decisions will be made about their future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic artist.
It was so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 Years of Impartially Qualified for Clearness
Ruppert Döller, the manager of the Water Force "Venestone Group", is in the state of peace.
The connection is defined as "stupidly far away".
A small French water supply link as a model for large water producers.
This was the first time in the originalton in a contribution from the Bayer Roundfunk.
Shortly thereafter, the Water Forum of the Government of Sub-França de Sub-França de Sub-Frequent des Constituencies held its purpose.
The work of the Vetenstone Group is considered to be "byernwide as exemplary".
After all, Rupert Döller, who was 31 years in the trade union, was 28 years of age.
Now he was adopted in peace at the age of 65.
The drinking water chain of the Vetenstein group, located in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, provides about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and toilets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the communities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Bauanach.
Water supply contracts are available for other cities and communities.
The current president, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Döller was appointed as a water guard in 1985 and was already appointed director of the Task Force in 1988.
"His tasks have been very numerous and they have expanded from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions until the necessary deadlines," said the president.
As outstanding events, it called for the introduction and extension of new sources (1994), basic purchases in the field of new sources (1998) and the destruction of farmers, the healing of high stocks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial updates of water management.
It has given no room for silence and repeated innovations have been made because water life is the most important food.
In their laudathio, they praised Düllers for their trust, confidence and right service over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water supply, and he lived the water supply regularly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, however, he could present the success concept of the road group for nitrification before the Water Forum in the Sub-Franch Region.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Döller, on the other hand, praised the waterguard Alfonso Gribel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water waiter and he was a faithful button.
Together, we were a team that couldn't help.
As high points from his point of view, he referred to the construction of the bridge and the restructuring of the purpose link.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the rohrbrück at the top of the church hall on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, the entire night must be worked back so that the places can be provided with water.
It is also possible to maintain the supply of New Brunswick only once because you have filled the top of Pettstadt here with holes.
The management of the drinking water chain was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who followed Rupert Döller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko is open with the autism of her son Tiago and turns to other parents concerned: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was diagnosed in her son, she believed that she had to die.
But the eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and now learn private in New York, where it gives the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that leaves him two years ago when I sing on the Milan scale, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in pregnancy - A man shoots at a life-threatening
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multifamily house in Barghtehedie (Kreis Stormrn) and killed her.
"The man himself called and offered to shoot his life-threatening killer," said one police spokesman.
The father is on the run, after him will be publicly punished.
In the middle of the day, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters large, muscle-burned and has a glass.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it's a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glaze.
The man should not be answered directly.
He could still carry the guns, like the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police speak of a relationship state.
The victim was in 1988, the father in 1981.
At first, the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the action or the relationship between the victims and the victims; but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder case."
"We don't say anymore now," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
As a result, eye tags were a special insert command (SEK) on the tatort.
Steel - light for Germany steel industry
The crisis-intensive and energy-intensive German steel industry remains at additional costs to millions.
Financial burdens incurred by the eco-strom industry are from the table.
It remained with the release of the renewable energy plant in the so-called property production facilities in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Journal" (WAZ, Freita issue).
"I'm really glad we could finally reach the negotiations after two years."
The European Commission had first planned to request the steel manufacturers to use the gas from the head of the power plant for their own consumption.
The steel industry reported additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental sign with the EU Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in steel works will a 20 per cent EEC installation fall.
But neither will they be raised in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-production.
The status quo of the previous regulation will be further defined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"In view of our campaign, 'the scale is the future', this is a first step."
"Continue to follow."
"Emissions law reform also has to consider climate and employment objectives," IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt stated.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and a significant price pressure.
In the past year, the situation continued as the world's largest producer country, China, in view of the fragile domestic demand for mass steel, was on the world market.
European manufacturers are offering Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this spring, the situation was somewhat tense.
On the other hand, the economic outlook in China has been maintained for a show of import duties on imports of steel.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained vigilant on Thursday.
In the past, the prices had increased.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further reductions in costs.
At last Thyssenkrupp also did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July the German steel manufacturers remained cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced by 3.4 million tons well six percent less stainless steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Union of Steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced was now back in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production is two per cent below the previous year's value.
The link is due in the coming months to an improved contract with an increasing outflow.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for the elderly
The song has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school, she played the art of music at the school, and today she sings 78 years of age in an adult choir.
"Singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy and more alive, she says.
Besides, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Because Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German Seniors.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with equal audiences, says Hackler.
Through regular interaction, seniors can link and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her chor: "I agree and organize myself to leave and learn from others - a chor is a very special form of cohesion".
Singing can be intense in a positive sense, I mean hacker.
Because in this, seniors train a deep and controlled atmosphere.
Anyone who regularly asks for his lungs does not make it so fast from the dust every day.
Even if it's about to get the sound of the voice in the age, singing is an excellent hobby.
In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher score, which was part of every day, both at school and at leisure, she explained.
Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs in older people produces many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
By song texts and especially melodys, people with dementia feel themselves at long-lasting events.
In addition, when singing the head, Lenz explains that a special performance is required.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and a certain rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice, not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by the singing in the choir, says Hackler.
A popular audience is a great lobby.
The self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I long for something to do, I will be better and grow up beyond me - this experience is strengthening.
Good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.
Whoever wants to try a new Hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having a little talent, save Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who's gonna hear it when one hundred goes down there?
Looking for the suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the recognized circle is in a senior school, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the environment.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can direct himself to the community or the church leader.
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet search.
Whoever has to sing, should join a choir, tell Hackler.
Singing does good to the soul and has something to release - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cat on the cry of young people
Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of the call of Katzenbabys on adult animals.
To their surprise, the monkeys also did not call men - but they always felt the difference between women.
Women's cats can recognize the degree of discovery of Katzenbabys in the young.
They respond about ten percent faster to the sound of cats, who are in great need, as scientists have discovered from the Hannover Medical School and the Hannover Medical School (MHH).
Although Kate also reacts to the call of Kätzchen - however, it is always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between the monkeys of less and stronger young animals for men are either not real or not significant," said the Biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and tonnage of the Kätzchen race differed from the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the holding of the MHH.
They were given a call from small ones who were taken from the wurfbox for three minutes and were separated from their mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were faced with screams of stronger lifts, which were further raised.
The researchers maintain their results despite the low sample sample strength.
"All women, even those who had not yet had their own grandchildren, reacted differently to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this sound of the very nice cats played.
This ability may have been born or developed by sex.
"It was a surprise that the men had already responded," said the biologists.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to needles, whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski handles with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sikur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a sea command was issued against the sole football star Hakan Sikur.
He will be called to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the dust test in Turkey, another important football game takes place.
Before the duel of the bursts between the sights of Istanbul and Lucas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is mentioned.
Already, in the event of the withdrawal situation after the return test in July, the government meant that normal citizens should not be affected every day.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of listening to the movement of the prognosis of Fethulah Yellow, which is responsible for the dust test.
This is also not done before the football.
In contrast to the former Starkicker Hakan Sikur, the government government issued a court order.
In the meantime, it is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
Thank you for being a candidate of the President of the State Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the Putschwig test.
Although the exceptional situation for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact, it has no effect on the lives of most Turks, but it is as good as it has no effect.
The night's "Democratic Watch" on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan finished on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - split into gangs and anti-erdogans.
Especially fans of the work club are not traditionally considered to be friends of the president.
In view of the dramatic experiences of the Turks, what is happening in history is the strict rejection of military forces.
Even the fans are few - no matter whether their heart is beating for Galatasaray or visatas.
There will be a special arrival at Lucas Podolski at the Pocalsiger "Gala".
His sport value was shown by the Kolner in the current season: with 17 towers and nine proposals in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first time as topscore of his union.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatic" married him: "He was the best in the place."
He concluded the season in a wonderful way and assured his men of the Pokal.
Thanks to "poldi" the exciting season for the recordmaster found a promising conclusion.
After the pre-run K.o in the League champions, the "Lowues" also broke out early in Europe League.
In the super light, it was just six.
The season wasn't good.
The poker was the only chance to win something.
"That's what we've done, and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master's work, he loved the game year better.
In particular, Mario Gomez, who was the founder of the 14th title of the Super-Lig-Torschücken king of 26 seasons.
That is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31st year.
In this case, the AC Florenz was under contract and was only informed of Gomez's status after the test, because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"When Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the professional magazine "Kicker" Club chief Fikret Orman.
However, the stormer had to be prepared to abandon around a third of his estimated 7.5 million euro annual salary, Orman clearly stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already shut down twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistblelower Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other overcrowded Light Teetheltic siners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio about medals.
The theme Doping is still as in front of the battle lines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian skimmer Julia Jefimowa, who had recently complained about her starting rights before the games after a Doping-Spere, was promptly excavated and suspended at her start (100 metres of chest).
It was a dark scenario: With a raised chair, she was still glorified in the hall and was engaged in her performance.
As soon as she realized she wasn't getting gold, the public went out in a jubilant storm.
But there are still many other athletes who, despite Doping's past, go to the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's a overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m-Stuffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in the lighthouse.
He was already shut down twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006 until 2010).
Since its Ban, the Olympics of 2004 and the former World Master has run even faster than before, he is more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price (100, 4x100-m-Stoffel/Jamika): The two Olympics and seven-year-olds had to refrain from a six-month-old spree following evidence of the introduction of the pain product oxycodon.
After an operation, she had severe toothaches, which protected herself from the 29 years of age.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): The 2012 Olympics were tested by the 2013 World Master and European Master from 2010 to 2016 in favour of the prohibited stimulants methylhexanamin.
Perkovic is fighting the critical occupation and has been shut down for six months.
The four largest volumes this year go to the account of the great goldfavoritin.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Stoffel/USA): The Beijing Olympics and two world masters over 400 m, were tested positive in 2010 and stopped for 21 months.
A measure of pension increases has been responsible, meaning merit.
In this year, the 30-year-olds are over 200 and 400 feet [200 m] of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Although almost one athlete was known for his many medals at night.
Tichon lost his WM title in 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The average 40-year-old Olympic Silver also had to give 2004 due to Steroid Dopings and the EM title for testosterone abuse in 2006.
He also received the bronze medals of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Court of Sport CAS.
With 80.04 m, it is located on a range of two of the world's ranges.
Liu Hong (20 km away, China): The world recordr and goldfavoritin was tested in May only positive, but can still start in Rio.
At the age of 29, indications were found on the introduction of a prohibited food supplement, the spores of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell slowly and died on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austerreicherin injured - Several deaths
The Austrian message in Thailand is with the woman in contact, said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
You have had cut wounds and have been treated in the hospital, but you have already been able to leave it.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the other explosions on Phuket Island and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, as quickly as possible.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok’s capital, was originally bombed on the Donnerstagbend in a mine of two bombs.
According to the police, about 20 people were killed in Thailand, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives again went high, and the authorities said another man was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
In the detonation near the Badestrands Patong, popular in holiday resorts, a taxi driver was injured after police entry.
In Surat Thani, on the south coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed a city employee.
According to the flow rate, the authorities had entered the air in a flower zone before the coastal police review.
Finally, detonation in Phang Nga and Drag required several injuries in the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast.
You're going out of a relationship with the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombings bring the same manuscript," said military general Danai Kritmethavee on Friday morning before journalists.
"We're going to find out that it's a coordinated attack."
It would be too early to eliminate possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, however, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamic resistance movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotoge that limits itself to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
There is much more to learn that the bombs were placed by the conquerors of the military unit.
In the past days, the authorities had received confidential evidence of previous attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and place.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police showed their officers throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.
In Thailand there are still smaller bombings, but most of them are not against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends, on its website, to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Sungklla as well as Preah Vihear and the environment.
According to the differences between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travel in these provinces will be postponed.
Increased safety risk (Section 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a bill drawn up by the military junta.
This also has a great impact on the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to hit Chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improving the economy and tourism.
After a phase of bloody disturbances in 2014, the military route itself must have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, it has not been possible for the military to gain the rise of Muslim rebels in the grip of the crisis for years in the eastern southern part of the country.
More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.
More than a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack in the younger history of the country.
The right to "identificate movement" is addressed as a visit to the Federal Constitutional Protection Agency.
After several national agencies, the constitutional defenders in the feds also took note of the group.
"We see in the 'identary movement' the starting points for efforts against the free democratic framework'," said President Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
This is the case with a growing Islamic belief or from the Middle East in extremism.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitary Movement" is a group of French words that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It refers to "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "loss of identity by overcrowding".
Constitutional defenders in nine Federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringen - have already observed the "identifiers".
The measure said that its authority had closely agreed with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identity movement' try to get their target group out where they are," said the Constitutional Court.
In general, extremists try to communicate with young people’s language, often with poppyer music.
Islamists do this as well as law-extreme.
That's not a significant advertising for your own business.
The propaganda is supposed to touch people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
In recent years, it has provided reports from several federal countries on contacts with AfD politicians.
Meat said he didn't have any knowledge.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this type were only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is clear whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - has been modified by certain persons who are extremists, who are becoming extremists and are becoming so extremist.
It is therefore exceptional whether such persons have influence over the party.
This would not be recognized.
In view of the significant increase in legal penalties and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, he said that he would not yet speak of new legal terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have established that there can be legal terrorist structures.
It gave the Old School Society group or the Freitaler Group.
It may be too late that further terrorist groups or minority groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee camps or attacks from other rights-extremist motives.
However, a worldwide or European control of justice terrorism would not be recognized.
The previous groups were established at the regional level or in social networks.
Measures were made to ensure that many overcrowdings were carried out on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the carer.
Many of the perpetrators of assaults on asylum accommodation have not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated offenders or advocates of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes which had nothing in the way of legal extremism, which may have been politically neutral or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or links, which have been radicalized by a right-to-left vote. "
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros has become online
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the battle lines of the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros had during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the light-weighted swimming pool from Ethiopia was so slow that it was not currently seen in the TV images.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the section was chosen.
In the social networks, there was also official Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends up with a delay of 48 seconds, leaving the 59th place of 59 stars.
However, it was not just a sports figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why does 24-year-olds still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make Swimming known in sub-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, they simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros has made himself ready for the big race.
The first names quickly made the rounds.
Some media called him "robel of the Wall."
The English Boulevardblat "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made it fun.
His time, he only beat with a minute and almost five seconds over 100 meters freestyle, did not play a role there.
Compare with "Eric the Eel" was also taken.
During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's career was focused on media attention.
Unforgettablely, the appearance of the Swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was when he had to stand alone in a race of over 100 metres freestyle.
Frenetically, Mossambani was burned.
The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the battle.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at the new site has been arrested.
According to the police, the 67-year-old cheerleader had left his business on Monday at 17.30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., about 250 euros were lost from the case.
Tracks of the tractor could not be found.
Also a video surveillance is not available.
The current selection does not appear to be a valid one
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump talks on an election campaign in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election to the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He's gone to the holiday.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, it would be quite inappropriate for him to say, "It's going to happen either, or I have a very, very, very, long vacation," said the candidate of the Republicans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it is all right, Trup said.
He thus called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrormilez Islamic State (IS).
In his party, the last time there was more resistance.
Post is increasing in trade with electric transporters
An electric gear vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the threat is obviously great.
The post plans to sell your electric vehicle along the streetScooter.
In short, the companies want to start trading with the carrier.
The post will also offer its electric transporters from the next year on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking whether they are to be sold to other companies with letters and packages.
Mr Gerdes, Mr Gerdes, had said that there was always a question, like, about manual workers.
According to the newsmagazine "The Spiegel" the Bonner Group wants to increase the mass production of vehicles in the short term.
In the subsequent manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars, and several long-term shifts towards environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're making the complete fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active in Germany since 2014.
GfK management is based on confusing business figures
The consumer research company GfK excavates its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult position of the market research company GfK has led to the fact that the chair of President Matthias Hartmann will become more insecure as long as the success promised by him remains.
Turbulents at the top of the Nürnberger Market Research Company GfK: After again disturbing business figures and the return of the company, the worldwide number five of the industry is before a personal start.
GfK Head of State wants to leave the company for the year.
The President of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already acting on 12 September from the Supervisory Board.
The management of the board was already taking place on 1 September by the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, who shared with the company.
He should officially assume the function of a "Proposer" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the return, the company referred to the long-term business policy approach as "individual views".
In detail, a business speaker did not want to be called on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research companies in the future are still unclear.
In the case of applicants, the fact that the shareholders had recently been disappointed by the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago was a major factor.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK Spice since 2011.
"But the fruit of restructuring is still not to be seen after 5 years," he said.
In view of the latest bad GfK business figures, each participant will at any time be discouraged.
"If that were the case at BMW, the Quants would do the same," he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss on the previous quarter in the second quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, the turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the corresponding previous quarter.
With regard to the first half of the year, the turnover fell by EUR 722.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter, in particular the company's low value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company's investment documents of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience area, provided the company with a loss of EUR 148.2 million under the strike.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK was still a group win of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus rustled in cormmorants in graven:
In the event of an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of them suffered serious injuries, sharing with the police.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to remove their data from an incoming cargo that was partly on the opposite route.
The bus came right out of the street and crashed into a grave, as reported by Aurich/Wittmund police spokesman.
"Because of the position of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The firefight frees the insatises.
Six rescue cars and a notary car came to an accident on the country street 2.
The injured travelers were brought back from a line bus to the town hall Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic meter of water shall be charged from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkhalt 3,44 EUR; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 Euro (up to 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up to 2,18 euros).
In the case of the plant in Azendorf, the water tax will be increased no later than once if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic meter.
As reported by Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU), it was established by the Landratesamt Kulmbach that disclosures were made for these wastewater plants.
The Cassendorf market would have been obliged to operate the facilities on a cost-effective basis.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and business and industry companies will have to take a deep interest in the currency exchanges of Welschenkal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg.
The rate increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Panel, a recalculation of the charges for the wastewater facilities of the market was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-relationships from the previous calculation period will also be comparable.
The serious tax increases were based on Schmidt, which is located between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year in all three water plants around relatively small facilities with a very low water drop.
This would seriously affect, for example, the use of necessary repairs of several thousand Euros due to the lack of distribution base.
In addition, the removal of waste in all three plants is easy to withdraw.
In all three plants, the calculation period in question has not yet been achieved due to their ageing and repair applications.
The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschchenkal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical disposal plant had to be replaced because of a damage.
In the pumpwerk Welschencal, almost 20 years old support facilities had to be completed on the ground, and the loop had to be completed after almost 20 years of operation of the first lighting station, the lighting lamp had to be removed, and an additional capacity was set up to allow water law to contain future standards.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary applications, the costs of maintenance and maintenance must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs that are still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waterfall in the three installations, the use of the operation and maintenance is "full".
In addition, Schmidt lost the market share of large maintenance costs in the wastewater plants in the past 20 years.
The situation for these installations will continue to be prudent in view of stone houses for long periods, so that the supply area of the water-related waste can not be extended to these facilities because it is more fictitious.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria is 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October, as positive 0.2% have been booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to -0.2% in July 2015.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed for the following groups of consumers: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
The prices fall in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remain as in the morning when drinking alcohol and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to race.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million users every day to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way and a way that is already limited to absurdity.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that could be imaged from a Roy Liechtenstein.
The filters are unbleached, property-changing tools that produce more than 30 million improved Selfies per day.
All cases have reached the public.
Snapchat filters have been critical in the past, in which they were accused of promoting the app blackface or white skin as a beauty side.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them castles, false teeth, and uplifted walls, some critics called it a racist character of Asians - "Galb face".
They asked themselves if these repeated contradictions indicate a greater problem that the company has a variety.
The news and the delivery were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature.
The company apologizes: the filter was thought to be gay to anime characters and not as a character of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of harmful clicks.
Others chose the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets over the photos were widely circulated, wrote that the filter "was infamous and unappreciative."
She added that "it was difficult to argue against the transmission of a very negative Asian character and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-eyed, but that the yellow-eye has been drawn into the reflective extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that transcends this cultural steel trade.
The American culture seems to be developed in an endless struggle of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchats, a large audience of young people - who are different in matters of race than their older opponents - could be more willing to wait for sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters generates a picture that is misleading for a user, "it is much harder to keep such things out of notice than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and media engineer, decided to remove her snapshot account, asked others to do the same.
In a media interview and a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race-related disputes reflected a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the great part of the white, only male leadership and ended their suit with a Hashday: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Neither have they a different representation of people with other skin colors in their community so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions in which they feel secure or willing to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat has left largely unresponsive.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its membership and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat started to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to one speaker, the company recently set up a staff responsibility focusing on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said that she would leave her snapshot account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users than we need to say that it's not O.K.."
Military conduct false ISIS secret service information, established by the Committee of the Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to paint an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual conditions in place, a committee of inquiry of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, drawn up by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committee of the Armed Forces, the Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports great discontent under the Central Command Secret Service providers, who reported how their appreciation for American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Message service information, which was typically withdrawn by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual state of the country and were more positive than the analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The Ten-Six-Sixth Report provides details of ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi combat forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government teams have given Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have seen the pressure of their legislation to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official announced publicly that a military reconnaissance of Mossul could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman of Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the news service reports to take the risk out of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans call the Task Force alive after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the findings are continued.
In addition, further findings of the Centcom reports are being made by the General Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created a very limited process for the creation of news services assessments to ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the High-Special Democrat of the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Shipf, in an opinion.
This process, said Mr. Shipf, "has delayed the publication of news reports", damaged the moral among analysts and "gives too little room for different opinions."
But Mr. Ship and the Democrats pointed out that they had not found any evidence of an invasion of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the conference's findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, New York Times reported reports of investigations by the general inspector of the Pentecost, who were filed after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the findings of the Inspector General were still in progress.
But he also pointed out that "experts sometimes have conflicting opinions about interpretation of complex data, and that the media and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence."
The findings have shown an impact on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made between a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The charges of last year, however, have raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for fair appreciation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state reminds us of doubts over more than ten years ago, as a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote about how the then government under George W. Bush, against the recommendations of many analysts, predicted only a small employment gap in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in protesting the current report on the Islamic state.
In the past year, the team, according to government agencies, stated that, contrary to the Government's statements, air raids against the refineries held by the Islamic State, had no significant impact on the financing of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had been operating to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms of the same commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war camps at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to peace in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA won the fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain before
One day after she shot three towers during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American Feldhoockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five towers in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember what to do.
"I don't know." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.
However, they know this: Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Games and are still in their group with the British in the first place who remain unarmed after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both men have already qualified for the fourth final, the game will be decided which of the two groups within their group of six teams will be achieved in each of the first and second places.
The first place will take the strong Dutch people a little longer away from the way they lead the other groups.
As the game may always go out on Saturday, the Americans have solved a surprising cycle through their success history, four years after they landed in the last 12 places in London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years she had a hockey player in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), and at 16 years she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the framework.
Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything was going to happen.
The following year Craig Parnham, an English trainer from the National Team, began to make things better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the pension in London, which we now have.
We've been able to get rid of the Ruder completely.
At the Donnerstagbend, Bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a back-hand from the vicinity.
If he had not won the tournament, but the team showed surprise and held the game from 1 to 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She filled out a sprint with the flat ball over the left wing, then she went into the middle and jumped the ball into the door to get the Americans a 2-0 driver.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final tower in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of all tournaments for the American torhuterin, Jackie Briggs, who had to buy a tower in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how good is the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the line of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, there are the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and unmovable, a raging stage between competition and competition.
It's like the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stick, which is made from the armbrush shield to the bow to the tournament to the triathlet.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting language in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time in the Olympic Games and is a woman's screen with scratches, could have been through these well-known names that were sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and relief TV advertising if he was a skirmisher, tournament or even a fan.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampolin Towers about gold.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
More from the center, partly in the shade are the sports types that are not generally recognized: Airguns, Bogenschets, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We're always going to have the chest we'll have and we'll have it over for a long time.
But if I have to make some arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discrepancy charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline leap has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was taken so suddenly in the last 16 years that many of those I have asked did not know that it is a type of Olympic.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US athletes have never won a medal in the trampoline race and until 2012 they have had an athlete who has won it to the end.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampolin spring has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthly enthusiast.
It has a humorous potential - the cardboard guitars of it never to end with the desired excitement - but also the thanks of the tournament and the baptisms, the two types of sports that it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Springboard".
Upward winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (drives, lifts and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program after execution, difficulty and flight time.
Two-thirds of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are represented in Rio.
The common Olympic vector is just right.
In their pursuit of gold, medalists must go up, up and up, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down in the playroom.
They not only pursue the destination or the way forward, but also a higher goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympics.
The targeted effort is noble, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to guide even a viewer to train.
But it's also what I feel like when I watch these games myself.
Of which, Trampoline offers an atemployment.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she's going off, seemingly as hard as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then impossible back up.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no ethical attack on the target, no guns in the distance, just the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It's just like competition in the Olympic Games.
The women's qualifications and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men will also be at 13.00 on Saturday.
NBC will emit the final rounds as part of a afternoon block at two days from 14 a.m.
In the middle of the Olympic Manie they promise a quiet, cool moment, one that is likely to be seen in general tumul.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved through the announcement and the objectiveization of male athletes - as the male US tournament suggests in The Wall Street Journal shortly - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-circuit, new prison ward.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S.
Strong protests in Ethiopia
Democrats who call for political changes in Ethiopia rise to fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses said that protestors were killed during the meeting with the police during the shooting.
Is Ethiopia just going to break up with it?
In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid West connector with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last months, protests against the government have devastated the country and have expanded to more and more areas.
In the last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the Government's response was unhindered.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed unarmed protesters.
In the context of the videos available on the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security forces beat young people with sticks while forced to make a stand against a wall.
The Head of the United Nations Human Rights Authority is now requesting a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most prosperous country in Africa, and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist attacks outside the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy was expanding at a critical time.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendler train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to pressure the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, where dissidents have been effectively brought to their senses.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or transferred to the length of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they don't have any other options to protest, it turns out," said Seyoum Teshome, a doctor in Central Asia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover all of the land use to the extent of the attack on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last sitting of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a struggle against this delicate, conflicting line required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts feared that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogade, who had been forced more or less in recent years to exploit turbulence and to fight again.
A number of factors explain why the feelings of prayer are now exploding under the surface after years of pre-infection.
The first seems unharmed: smartphones.
Only in recent years have there been a lot of Ethiopians able to communicate through social media, since cheap smartphones have become more and more popular and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government restricts access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do regularly, especially when protestants, can still communicate through Internet-procedures that hide where they stand.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemy.
Since Eon, the Amharas, from Ethiopia, who come from predominantly Christian heights, have thrived in politics and economy, while they have devoured the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We are about to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is being dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigriray, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the disturbance is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, has been the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death at an unpublicized disease in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about echoes.
Analysts say that he was particularly involved in taking early signs of discontent and using special tasks to treat and harm the opponents.
"The current regime lacks this basic message," said Mr. Abdi, a conflicttanalitic.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obvious reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigris region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy confidence in security services controlled by the Tigerray.
Many fear that the result will be more bleeding.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a setback in 2005, thousands of protestors protested against elections, which, according to analysts, appeared to have been excommunicated and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the following races, many protestors were killed, even though it was less than in the last months, and this time of disturbance was going on relatively fast.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visional infrastructure plan, such as the new pendler train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal mistrust.
And she's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protestors in Gondar, an amharic city, took over business led by Tigerray, and the hass against the Tigerray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into their own position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to join in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin graying."
Donald Trump explains his opinion Obama has established ISIS has been "Sarcasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to disrupt the last controversy surrounding his campaign, saying that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State, would not have been serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Republicans whether he could communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.
It also brings his competitors who try to protect him during an evental phase, in the actual position, to explain statements that he could not have made.
After he had made the announcement at a midweek election event, Mr. Trump called back on the charges on Thursday and said in interviews that he had not really intended to mention that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sardish.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he considered the charges to be completely serious.
When Conservative Radiomoder Hugh Hewitt Trump wanted to help Mr. Trump make the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wanted to destroy, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism hit Mr. Trump, while he tried to turn his campaign focus on the low price of the economy.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to come back to this subject again.
On Twitter, he warned that Mr. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech long ago.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he turned to strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should be looking at Mr. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I mean the sardachist."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries into politics and then, when necessary, to reverse them.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received from his fans, how they come, and then, if appropriate, "clear up" according to the reaction." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, observed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways and ways.
Instead of denouncing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump adopted an even more exciting tone as his round-up values have gone back.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with great influence in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocations, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while strengthening his attention in the last few months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal competitor into the most comfortable situation, to stand up to him, regardless of how causing his statements.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps' prominent speakers, gave great pleasure to the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was a almost unknown little organization, he called it interface banks, completely wrong and that is why he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government of Obama, who served as Foreign Minister in Mr Clinton, allowed ISIS to expand by letting them take control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and urged them to return to each of his words and to be taken in advance against him.
He raised the "army, friendly" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats argued about Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.
First over the price from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a charming coffee in Williamsburg, where you could only pay bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were excavated.
The Soap Cherie store, the verb replaced in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Locals treated it as the last loss in a city that was entrants.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is gone and Verb is now a ship business."
But if New York is a change, then it is also a recovery.
A reopened verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but it still has some of the same employees and a similar bad atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old Café, the owner and business leader of the new Café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outpost, he was asked to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, has a lot to do with it.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He brought in new ingredients.
On the food map are sandwiches with specks and cheese and there are garages such as hats and satisfactory biscuits.
There's natural travel shoes.
The coffee doesn't serve beer anymore, there are fresh shops for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady flow of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers have also been hit by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the talk was closed, she gave her coffee a long time to drink, she said.
"I was made clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though this day she replaces her usual Iced Coffees with a blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-old and trusted customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.
He went there in front of the work and ordered without delay Dasselbe.
"I came to the fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss cupcake and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with spin, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he didn't mean anything about the sale of fish to the old store.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soup for verb with the cold-bred coffee of the coffee.
"I think we're still going to get on your offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish Greenpoints have also accepted the Café.
A new customer has moved the food card into Poland and Rodriguez said he is ready to take it out immediately so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location has further advantages.
A local Saft local wants to fill in and sell the cold brown coffee in the bottle.
There's a chance that the café expands on a nearby building.
For many customers a new verb is needed to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a tribal customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the coffee was closed.
When the new coffee opened, White said that the presence of the local and the order felt a new coffee like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressed food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal time"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt had a weakness for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue such as pâte de foe grass and Maryland Waterschild cream soup.
His menu on this day was something different: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes and as a dessert a flowering powder.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" was from the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest cooperation, "A decent meal time", which will appear on the Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, fast-paced imbis in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with cardboard powder and mixture.
As the reporter Hackbraten ordered, this found the couple suitable for a discussion on food in the era of great depression.
"The rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was earthnus broken, liver and bohnen broken.
They were prepared from a juice and something cheap that spreads the juice.
Imagine eating so many vegetables that they serve them as evenings.
Coe greneste.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat buffet.
Women's men bought for male field workers and it was served freshly baked meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hundreds of Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" indicates the way the country is going to be no more.
"It was a time in which the American food became a central, exciting topic," Coe said, saying why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Also interesting was the new budget diet: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles were made for basic food, the casseroles being considered as "a wonderful sort of food residues," noted Ziegelman, since kitchens could hide unappreciative ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the middle of the American cuisine, became a rare luxury.
Personal mixes were tested as there was a clear and refreshing satisfaction prior to taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era, with groundnus butter.
"There was no popular addition to the afternoon view," says Coe.
Ziegelman continues: "It was super real."
Groundnut butters and ground-backed cables do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the households.
As never before or ever since, budget economyers - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have adopted the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to be entitled to the challenge of changing potatoes like cream spaghetti with carrots in costly meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical plays.
In particular, the reports on the Government's response to the hungering citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Esen-Haltung.
As he publicly praised the simple Iowa Farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he eats like the millions of men of the world he has become.
"He loved continental cuisine like fish with gorken sauce," said Coe.
He was in a pretty golden dining room and took a smoking.
He was a great promoter of reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the host of a housekeeper with no interest in taste directions by Mrs. Roosevelt that the white house produced the longest food in Washington, but also one of the most reliable preparations."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, to be treated with food, were burned as soon as the country returned to its bones.
The memory lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
By writing the book, the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother - for example, how she could not remove food.
"She had a real fear of the disposal of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: "They really made people sick."
Then there was the wind exchange.
After the tents at Eisenberg's were removed, they and Coe took a dessert that they had prepared at home: the flower dessert, the President Roosevelt at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to pass some recipes to a real name.
There was no shrubs, only flowers, some flour, sugar, water and cream.
Everyone came in a kind of mood in the teeth, brown glibs.
Suddenly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe three times had a seizure.
As a Can-Do-Budgeter said to his wife, "A few hacked Walnuts would help."
Killed by Bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
The 30-year-old is now dead in a phase bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to image-zeitung, has saved nearly 60,000 people's lives.
2600 Volunteers put their own lives on the game to get people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector showing him at an 11-hour rescue of a sage from the drummers of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the midst of the war.
But as Hellen never saw himself, he said, "This is the true Jihad for me."
"When I die to save my life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself was attacked by the victim, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters fired four fass bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorgas.
A woman and two children die, seven people suffer at Atemnot.
"We now eliminate the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he dies.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenland: The oldest wild beast is almost 400 years old
All right, let's see.
Greenlandhaie comes to the surface only in winter.
This Hai had to return to the sea after an investigation by the ship of Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swimming well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland has only grown up in 150 years.
At the same time, Greenland swims along the North Atlantic, within an hour it reaches just 1,220 meters.
Only when it reaches it, the five-metre-long animal speeds at a sate 2,6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robbe with this maximum speed.
But this long-term lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenlandha, which could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, observes these life spans that mean a world record for wild animals.
However, Evolution biologists have long been convinced that Greenland will be rocked.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland haie are hard to observe, and eventually they live mainly in the Ice Sea in front of the densely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually rise to the surface only in the winter.
Researchers know little about the life-style of Greenland.
They measure their timing when they equipped six animals with a messenger at the top of the mountain.
However, researchers found the rest of a robbe in the stomach of an animal, another had hit the tip of a young eagle.
They may hunt sleepy animals or patrol the sea and search for kadaffes that dry from higher water vessels to the bottom.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are now investigating 28 Greenland haie, the fishmen from 2010 to 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as beifang from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest Hai was only 81 cm long, while the largest 502 cm was measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lichens of the haie with the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eyeline is already created before the birth of the haie, which contains proteins, which will no longer be renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a great deal of carbon-14 in the lens.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, as an atomic weapon test, greater than the amount of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.
In the length of 220 centimetres of the smallest animal, however, the lynchers included a small excess of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 in its investigation.
In contrast, all the larger Greenland hares had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the 14-hour carbon watch for a 493 cm long Greenland has shown an age of 335 years, while the record Hai should be 502 cm even 392 years old.
The Greenlandha Webbchen was known for growing up when they were more than four meters long.
Now the researchers were able to get an old age.
Since one of the animals with 392 cm apparently stood on the threshold of sexual activity and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland haye is apparently at least half a century old.
This should also be a world record for wild animals today.
This is not an accident.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland waltz, also caught a 120-year-old harpoon chip on his neck, was arrested before Alaska.
Because of the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on spar flame.
So they're getting slower later - and older.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal heats.
The loss of heat from a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many prey as possible as possible," explains Evolution’s Biology Schuerlein.
A very large animal, however, should invest its resources in a longer life.
Base Card in Double Pack
On the subject of building, the Council has taken the most important part in the recent session.
With ease, the panel pointed out by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
Following clarification of the basics, parceleration and development issues and the applications for reconciliation were made, the sale of the basics in the residential areas of "Straßlög" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße Area - Development Section 1) is no longer in the way of stakeholders.
The Council is convinced that construction sites in the rural and quiet residential area of beautiful young families and hardworking older people are equally affected.
As it has said, constructionists can immediately report to the Council, and it is expected that the Council will be consulted at its September meeting.
In addition, in order to allow for requests for assistance from other companies, associated with the creation of jobs, the Council decided to amend the area-use plan, which was set up first in the spring of this year in sub-areas.
Thus, in the area of sub-periods, the business area already assigned there is expanded by two Parcels towards the state street 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main, then, has the best chance of attracting lost jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtlander, Head of the field of competence of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is unknown whether households can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
To date, they are authorised in Britain for this EU passport.
That's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to reduce jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" consists of 10,000 new jobs in Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, such as the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the EIOPA and the ESRB risk framework, is discussed by the European Central Bank.
While in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its main position, this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The approach to the note bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW professor Voigtlande.
Although Luxembourg had a large fund industry, it also cut down as much as Dublin's infrastructure.
Frankfurt would be much easier to reach with thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily available business furniture.
"It's not as easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtlande.
In addition, the rents for first-class business furniture were 50% higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's company advice, the city stands at seven, Luxembourg at 19, Dublin at 33 and Paris at 37.
Even if quality of life is a question of preference, "with its already strong position as a financial position for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW continues.
London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit Votum, which the researchers believe.
There are also strong relationships: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba End 2015 there were around 144,000 people in the banking industry, there were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent struggle with Merck
One U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has claimed the reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the hepatitis C law struggle with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a damage charge of $200 million for the destruction of two patents from Merck, who were associated with the blockbuster meds Sovaldi and Harvoni from Gilead, after a U.S. rich man discovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of the brand, including mine and other unethical actions.
When the complaint was filed on Thursday, U.S. Director Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had claimed the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to compare with Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back in 2013 when Gilead and Merck claimed to have been accused of laboratory work, which was based on Sofosbuvir, the active substance in the medicinal products of Gilead.
US-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manby from the Islamic state again.
The U.S.-supported troops have returned full control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISS fighters left them in the city, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are now taking over the remaining groups of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have released over 2,000 civilians who have been held as hostages by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish shared with the manby military rank Reuters, associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under full control, but we are just doing space work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million was spent for well-being purposes, mainly on the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton acquired nearly USD 5.3 million in Redehonoraries; the former Foreign Minister received an income from USD 3 million from Simon & Schister for her book about her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, published his tax statements with his wife Anne Holton over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and returns to his previous commitments to publish his tax declarations.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, even though they are not required by law because they are not required to do so.
Trup, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have provided a tax check by the tax authorities for his refusal.
"They're in training," wrote Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks were completed.
Trump Critics, including the Republican presidential candidate for the year 2012 Mit Romney, have already allowed his refusal to raise questions about property, his funds for charitable organisations, his business and various other links, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already been involved in the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday, demanding his tax release in the high-ranking Republican Trump.
On Thursday she also discussed the subject during a discussion on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements."
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist invited a number of tax collectors and tax advisers on Friday, who claimed that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and Investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska requested buffet, whose seat here is Berkshire Hataway Industrial Angle, to exchange Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax declarations.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax test by the IRS and Trup had "agst" before the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published a tax declaration back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, averaged an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax statement showed that they refer only to USD 100 of their income as a reward, other than the majority of Americans.
Its main currency was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clintons dividends and incomes of USD 109.000 were taxed.

Condoms with Chilipuder, Promote Fireworks, Tanzania Elefant protection
Natural protection in Tanzania uses an unorthodox type to prevent elephants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on those who are filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, together with the US-natural protection, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a violent four-stage method to protect their homes and families without harming animals.
Before, many spices have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is the day of the World Health Organization dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, where they are much more likely to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a falcon and the bottle in a horn.
If he's not fired, a so-called Chiliwolke will be shot.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firefly body in a condom, whose end is drawn to the sinister core.
When it is picked up, the condom will set up with a button and blow a nice dust on Chilipider into the air.
A hauk is usually already ready to betray the elephants.
A last possibility is a shipyard that shoots a gold miner into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City court decides unanimously: No kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
In general, St. Goarer's investment projects of business operators with Kusshand - but only the single market in the city is considered to be highly reliable.
The demand for a new shop at the railway station in the immediate vicinity of the railway station in the building, however, has now come to an end.
"In principle, we welcome new businessmen, but at this site in a representative position at the Rhine-Urish, this Kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath explained for the CDU Group.
Jewish Director proposes Berliner Hotel, because Israeli selection was removed after "arabic" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots picked up a media show after he said that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not registered an Israeli election, as Arab guests said an employee "had been asked".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his doctors at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not registered among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After an explanation, the director went to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel manager said the measure was a "determining decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason that stood behind was that there was more noise in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election be deleted," was quoted by Lanzmann's employee.
The Israeli messenger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were listening to this event and being disturbed.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has been applied to this hotel chain in Germany is even more damaging.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel "the right conclusions," said the officer.
The incident solved a rather large resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "given" the alleged demands of Arab guests.
In another entry, it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located near a synagogue, is located at the noble resort.
The hotel quickly showed all charges against itself and called the incident a "View" and "debt" at Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
"There has never been a direct instruction," Israel did not include in the quicklist," the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman from the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preference has now been added.
Police employs Trenengas & Gummingos against protesting Brazilian students
The students joined the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when they gathered to protest against government reform for the public education system.
The police set up trains and rubber shells against the demonstrators.
The difficulties arise when police officers try to separate students, leading to the use of rubber and trams.
Several hundred students participated in demonstrations to express their appreciation for the plans.
According to the proposal of the Governor of the state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be used to save money.
Some of the protestors saw graffitits against the former President Michel Temer on the wall.
The most recent protests arrived some days after demonstrators in mass march went on the streets to support the suspended President, Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate.
Trade between Russia & Iran is suddenly rising to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of sanctions, according to the Russian messenger in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 per cent in the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has increased strongly, the messenger shared with them.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that the trade volume between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, the Russian imports in Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rise by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade movement has been achieved through delivery of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the messenger.
Dzhagaryan is leaving a record of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative issued some 35,000 visas, in the first line of travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the records of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken since last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the messenger hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received the monuments of old Persian civilization in a good state," he said.
Witnesses sought: Overcrowded drinking market in forest brül
A robbery took place on Thursday on the wine market of Rewe XXL at the forest brüller Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a gun, three dark-headed people who had blinded their faces asked for the release of bar money from the drinking market from the employee of the market and then fled to foot at first and then probably with a silver-coloured VW floor.
How much money was spent, the police don't share it.
The roofs should be large between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, so relatively small.
The drinking market is immediately accessible from the Rewe market park.
After the accident, the tractors must be driven to Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the Schutter Park, located opposite the parking lot, with the silver-coloured car, possibly in direction B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (at 19.45 p.m.) which are related to the robbery should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Game and Fun at Summer Freedom
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical group/social work group of the Child Protection League Nagold with their guardians on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlucker.
In the quiet free time, hardtwaldläldle was the lively group in the first week of school.
Several full-time vacations were on the program.
To one, it went to Britten with the visit of the Sreegelzoos.
To others, to Maulbronn, where there was a special birth control in the world’s famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Kelten Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily food and food of the Celtics.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which called for springing, swimming and planning.
Curiously, children and caregivers with their own prepared live meals such as the Saureen Spätzle, the seabroner Pfänle, the Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of pearl and stone were created or made from wood a Roman-Mühl game.
Further high points of leisure were the angels in a nearby section, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bonte Evening".
On the day of home trip, the sun and the children and young people returned home happy.
Hailerlog: Pilgrims for the sake of mercy
The ministers from Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way to a four-day pilgrimage from Willingen to Freiburg.
Together, four steps were taken.
In order to extend the time up to the next Rome Wall, all ministers are expected to spend two years, the Ministerial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day Pilger migration.
Various Walfarth destinations were tested and finally decided for the Bishop’s town of Freiburg, where this year, at the Holy Year of Barnness with the port of mercy opened at Freiburger Münster, a special Pilgeral objective was offered.
16 Minis from Bittel-source, Grool, Haigerloch, and Holy Rooms made themselves on the way.
On the night before, Father Stoorst sent the Pilgers out in a small festival in St. Anna, blessing the Pilger Cross and sharing the Pilger's victory.
From Horb was driven from the train to the starting point of Willingen, where there is also a monster of Our Love Woman and thus the Pilgerway was taken by the Monster.
Each morning and evening, each day’s journeys were covered by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.
But along the way, the minis at field circles, chapels or churches were always ready to sing together a song from their own joined Pilger band.
For the nights, each pharmacies of the local pharmacies were available.
At the stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi brought together a tasteful meal and breakfast.
On the second day, it went over for the march to Güttenbach.
The next day, the steps to St. Peter, which was the most intense road route, had to be cut off at the first 500 hill and then re-stamped again in cold heat.
In the evening, the prize was a common prize at Badweiher.
After the morning of the fourth Pilger day in the imposing monastery of St. Peter, it went to the closing stop to Freiburg.
Apparently, and fortunately, the minis met on the following afternoon at Freiburger Münster and passed through the ports of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thought of here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the ministers of Kooperator Markus Obert, who came to the Pilger's destination, were welcomed.
After the service of God, the Pilgers were able to visit the Sacristians and the Hochaltars.
The next day, it was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were short-lived.
Shooting Callum Skinner jumps home when Brite Gold cuts for riding
Scotland's Callum Skinner was the last night in the male team Sprint in Velodroom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the role of Landsmann Sir Chris Hoy, who made himself his own. The young pund made the legend proud when he went home to hide a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy held the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They resumed the trick after they held only a small sixth place in London in March at the train World Championships in spite of the return trip to Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of author Jamie Staff.
They did this right away as Hindus.
Hoys peace created a luxury that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man she stayed with when she saw potential in the shot that had just disappeared.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and skinners placed an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was almost back after his round, but Kenny brought the team to the front, and Skinner kept it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation that led to a higher pace in order to slow him down and enable Kenny and especially the skiers to maintain the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell skinner, Kenny, and Hindus when they got up on the podest.
The 23-year-old child from Glasgow said, "It's a beautiful comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set up an Olympic card in the final round and won the world champion.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the Triumph 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindus indicated that after a weak start, he fell onto the train.
He later returned this statement, and there was no argument from England's Rivalen.
There was no such problem this time in such an amazing victory.
He said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We've gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expected to be successful five days in Velodroom.
With the form of Kennys, it is in the area of the possibility that He won Hoys' victory over three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - who is 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - means an addition of six gold medals and a silver medal.
It's the same as Hoy's.
Kenny takes the next part in the Sprint, which starts today and will be gone in three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels like something's going on together to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be shot at the knight."
It was the only media competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doll qualified for the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.
They reached 3:51,942 at target.
The world record, won in 2012 in London gold, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) take place today on the second day of the competition, with the Wiggins will be focused on safety.
He had argued with officers before the qualification yesterday when he was called by functionals to measure his body size.
In the respective women's competition, which will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to acquire a sword to medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute domination in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were raised.
It was played in the background, thus the return of technical leader Shane Sutton in April between sexism and motivational prejudices as well as the rest of the sizes of Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in Velodroom, it looks like the legendary GBs that has reached its perfect peak could be repeated.
The future of Portland's Schmelzerei due to the suspension of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - is at stake as the operator announces the energy contract and thereby terminates all supply contracts, as the energy supplier announced.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies for the operation of the facility.
A subsidy established for 20 years runs out in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be threatened with closure.
In addition, it could have doodling effects, as the Schmelzeeri consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa concluded the point Henry Schmelzeeri, which led to the conclusion of the Anglo-sea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Schmelzerei in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the annual speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and the latter due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which provides the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, explained that three other owners are going to announce their contracts.
The facility consists of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubien Corp have smaller shares.
"AGL means that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means another physical demand for electricity by the Schmelzerei," the company shared.
AGL further stated that the contracts were to be so-called "secure businesses" that would have entered into force since November 2016.
The Treaties have a 12-month deadline so that they will be concluded in 2017.
"This is why AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the adoption in the 17th year of business," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on the revenue from the GJ 18 on AGL are currently limited by the forecasting of the strong long-term markets for wholesale electricity.
AGL reported that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual budget of $187 million in "Equipment of a conviction".
Alcoa said that the decision to issue contracts, "The ability to operate Alcoas... or to ensure electricity supply to the Schmelsery" did not affect the decision.
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Roy Yang, which would have entered into force since November this year, even though it is still a declaration of why it has been withdrawn from the contract.
Analytics warn against the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzeeri in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Regarding the statements of the analyst at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Cardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and four daughters of the manager and mother of the Cardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and loved the fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on their Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love brought me the look of this cover to wine," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the Cover followed a strange (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians like?), scriptified reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot their sister's cover and ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clycicized action almost every birthday period of a child's mission (Siacrest brought the sentence, "Do you think we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a sign-tricking rabbit at a post station about 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls somewhere in this publicity.
In view of the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Cardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim may have shot what the Vogue-Cover has done (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.
The issue of September is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.
With a range that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue refers to a large number of advertising players (as far as fashionista was from the 832 pages of the Forest 615 pages advertising).
The completion of its Coverstars is expected to be so visible that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been provided before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been clearly more "revelations, models" than "models, those of fame" on the cover.
Oscar priest and Dior Marken Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at Cover, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described in the journal as the "drug model" of her generation - under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not connected to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything comes to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are listed in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course Jenner's success is not for everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the model world was always something exciting.
In June, Victoria's only secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner, and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized her "the misses of the moment."
These feelings were bought up again when the message with the appearance of the Jenners came down on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to go beyond the point to go back to the mess.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the seventh edition of the Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It publishes for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of her produced by Cindy Crawford's daughter at LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's seen on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and their children.
Community law centres show 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are withdrawn annually from the Community law centres, while the industry is focusing on the effects of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, there are already three of five persons - mostly older persons, immigrants, auxiliary workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unfair and similar delegations - who are seeking free legal advice and legal assistance.
The legal services of the Community which have already been overloaded are being prepared for further cuts.
Since June the next year, it is expected that these legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal resources.
The Director of the Community Law Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that the last collection of the National Union of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being denied every year.
Farrell said that the situation would be worse without a suspension of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland Community Law Centres are provided with chronic funding, which means that thousands of people of important services you need will be denied," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with excessive and oppressive debt, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this collection shows that they can't get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funds by 30 per cent, which means that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any assistance.
We urge the Federal Minister of Justice and Secretary-General George Brandis, as well as the senators of Queensland, to step up these cuts immediately so that the people can get the help they need to get into legal problems.
Last year the Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to see the needs of the Community and its customers and that the Palestinian Government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump was charged with the election campaign after employees alleged to have taken weapons
New York: Donald Trumps Campagne was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had sent a gun to a staff member in February while they were in a jeep on their way.
The case is described in an appeal letter, which was filed on Wednesday at Charlotte's national court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Boroni suggested that for months waiting that the matter would be settled within before he realized that "that wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "take a gun, put his right finger on the trigger, and broke the run in Vincents Kniekel," Boroni responded in his complaint.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign guidance, Bordiri found that at least four other people had already done the same experience with Phillip, he added in the notice.
"We don't have to fire weapons to fix damage," Boroni said.
The complaint is only two days after the Republican presidential candidate released an appeal when he said a number of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - armed owners and armed friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media would have removed his words from the context and that he would not be arrested for violence.
Bordinis complaint requires damages from the campaign for the destruction of the care obligation and from Philip because of physical damage and persistent physical damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local messenger in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
On calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, no response was received.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is conducted by Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-13300, Oberste Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Request for country elections: lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties were incurred.
This presented representative questions from the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Image" Zeitung (Freeday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.
In both Federal countries, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have a good chance to continue to place the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party therefore claims that it is only a matter of time before the CDU, which could rise to 23% again.
The third place is between the left and the left.
The links reached 19 per cent (up to 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented by 19 per cent for the first time in the country.
The greens, despite easier losses with 6 percent (preceeding 8.7%) will be re-entered into the Schweriner's landday.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent on the day of landing.
In Berlin, the SPD of the survey was only 23 per cent (2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but before the links with 15 per cent (previously 11.7 per cent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Commons.
By 5%, the FDP could hope to return to a return, which would lose the entry by the pirates in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timetable: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicationor came to the market.
The followers today dominate the world’s manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device was nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory originally consisted of eight Megabytes, which would be available today for about two Selfies with a high resolution.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a couple of euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somewhere from the time of the Internet time.
20 years ago, however, the communiqué was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the computer exchange Cebit in Hannover as "Office in Western Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of text messages and e-mails for then standards, even by fax, the communicationer was able to reach it.
Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, even if it was relatively slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be picked up like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black screen were found.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
No one could know in August 1996 that the communicationator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything's different.
The deaf phones are a success story, even not for Nokia.
The phone-sparte of the finds experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and developed to Microsoft.
The market is dominated today by suppliers who all came to Nokia a long time later.
Always be online and everywhere, this is today for many people every day.
There were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple were sold for only 555 million pieces.
The worldwide trade with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
The well-run business comes from the payless app provider and the telecommunications company.
Around the smartphone was created between a whole industry.
The decisive break to the mass market began in early 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicater, to easily use everything via touch screen.
The Apple victory began, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the following.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The words now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-evident 20 years after its discovery.
In the meantime, each German looks at his phone between 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to remove the smartphone even once," said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in Siemens.
In the meantime, permanent accessibility is equal to flight and blessings.
England has to link the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country innovation and prosperity.
For me, this was the largest Heathrows attraction, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will have 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs, and the youth unemployment in the airport will come to an end.
As they were before us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bullied at the world stage.
The two were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and to leave a wealth of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion tenure infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years following the world's best airport terminal, to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent stages of the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to relax this Olympic spirit and increase Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a wealth of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasure
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz-and- Mouse Game" for display blocking
For companies who earn money online, according to one of the software manufacturers' attempts to turn display blockages, a cat and mouse game is equal.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding its advertising display to make it difficult to recognise the identification of the part of the advertising page.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to move new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the show-blocking Open Source Community and the environment has been ongoing since the discovery of advertising blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how it has become a very careful indicator blocker for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a recent study by Page Fair and Adobe, about 200 million people are blocking the preaching work; almost four times as many as 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users daily accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, phone calls make 84% of Facebook ads.
The company has looked at screen blockers on Desktop PCs since mobile display blockers have no effect on Facebook mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a speaker shared with.
Advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a large part of the revenue, so Facebook seems to invest such a step as a reward value.
On Tuesday Facebook shared that it would update its "view preferences tool" to give people more control over their intended advertising.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblocks would take care of new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising.
"It is not a positive experience for the user, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook speaker in an e-mail message.
Showing blocking is a tricky means, why we have instead focused on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Transfer a woman on a possible suicide on a Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a car on Thursday morning at a possible suicide of several vehicles.
The event took place on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman stood on the street in the dark "in an act of doubt" and were hit by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swissman at the age of 49, who was transferred from several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She's still dying in front of her place.
A number of drivers have already been arrested, but some have not yet been identified, the police who called on them and any witnesses of the case to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logic" step in such a situation, told Gilles Hofstetter to the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected that one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a combination inevitable?
That's something the government lawyer has to decide," said the Court of Justice.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not taken into account.
In each of the two cases - in which a person died in the darkness on the highway - it was decided that the motorists should not depart from the fact that a passenger walks in the middle of the night on the highway, as it did in the newspaper.
Last year a police officer was released after she had passed over and killed a man who was on the A1 night near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court took.
The court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency -- acted in a just and fair manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "very unusual and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the event on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was first viable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably the first to be inhabited.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus through tools and algorithms that resemble climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surfaces and CO2-dated atmosphere could have provided only a pleasant setting.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, mindful atmosphere and still slowed down.
The model also shed light on the topography of the early Venus.
The planet may have seen more dry areas than the earth, but it had only enough water and geographical variability to bury life and protect it from rapid extinction.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent of the matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its sun's day page for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a rainscreen to remove the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the earth is today.
The model brought forward a story of Venus, which resembles Evolution, which was previously confused by planetary research.
Although it was probably habitable, Venus -- over billions of years -- was exposed to heat and ultraviolet light.
Her oceans were dwindled and her water pump was burned out of ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen evolved, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as a trainer of the Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy took the position of trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and brought about a very low degree of co-ordination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the Union will immediately seek a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, patience and determination," Roy said in an opinion.
During the summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, which is necessary and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with the organization.
He must also have a right of co-ordination when making decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had recalled Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and want him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the League during his Debt season 2013-14.
He led the union to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was shot in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and missed the next season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches listed 39-39-4 brands in the 2015-16 season and fall behind the wild for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference at five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, put out the strike
The work force on the reward for North-West Workers is suspended while all the parties to the table for a new round of talks said the negotiating leader.
Strikes against the oil service provider Wood Group were conducted on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the units and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to start the process of relaunching the current dispute," it means in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-time meetings in the next few weeks, beginning next year to tackle the problems again.
The trade unions said that her last strike, which was in the first over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
This year, Wood Group cut the rates on its contractors in the North Sea about 9 percent because of negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut is followed by a 10-percent discount for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts provided the company with the necessary space to get through market pressure.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to increase its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business as a result of its mega with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower raw materials prices, an economic situation that had been strengthened by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met this week with employers to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion will be expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to average around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler lost rotation rates of stars in the Plejaden Star Station
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational cycles under the stars of the Star House of Pleiades.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the constellations and how the rotational periods are connected with the planet's axis.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Plejades Star House is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this constellation, which occurred about 125 million years ago, now reach the age of adulthood.
They're moving fast now.
For peak rotation rates, these rising stars represent large amounts of star winners.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star is old, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler lost the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of an identifiable star-flight -- like sunflakes.
The latest catalogue of rotational cycles shows that larger stars slowly rotate rather than less mass stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, where larger stars slowly rotate pirates as smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be more intense, though faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the constellation of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmetic laboratory to compare stealer qualities like rotation rates.
"The Plejaden Star House offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stealer rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational cycles and so stop their "Danzschus".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomic Journal.
A fighter Baseball Star jumps off
The trains live at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US Baseball Star in good days from Base to Base.
After his emotional return announcement, the 41-year-old professional will be taken on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays for the last time in his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game Player of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player in the League, he won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract protected him from 27 million dollars annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - in full custody.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his team ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005, he has created several miles.
With Hall-of-Fama members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in the most important statistics show similar values.
However, the 41-year-olds should not be included in the Baseball's quiet hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so disputed his appearance is outside the place.
Already in 2009, Superstar at "ESPN" had banned steroids from taking place between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was closed for 211 parties due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been a major source of anti-aging clinics in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the spore was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The League could even have made a case for me for 2014 because I've been playing 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said then.
Nor did his days of separation go unheeded.
While many Baseball legends in their last games were once again getting the big stage, Rodriguez had to sit on the bank frequently.
"My job doesn't include a divorce tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
At the same time, Rodriguez, who was married to the actor Cameron Diaz, and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actor Kate Hudson was observed, sympathies of the fans by the Yankee Erzrivel Boston Red Sox.
"We for A-Rod", the attachment to the 4:9 Ninth attack against the Rodriguez team.
Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Remarkable: Due to a positive doping test, weighttheber Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overrun by the first official doping cases.
An infected athletic had almost won a medal.
The first official doping events have become known in Rio de Janeiro before the seventh day of combat.
The Chinese Swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-Hindernisleuferin Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish heavyweight Adrian Zielinski were tested and closed in Brazil - immediately before the start of the critically inspired light telematic competitions, these messages will come to an end.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking tool for doping substances, had already been demonstrated.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court of the CAS confirmed its conclusion of the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m Schmetterling, just 0.09 seconds she passed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the 50 m free-style course.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-test and listen.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted a communication saying: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport CAS and accept the judgment".
The IOC is no longer the first time in history, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning sportsmen with positive cases.
Also on Rio's night, the news of the positive trial at Danekowa, which took 33 years into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV sender BNT.
They were innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the leichtatelite.
The report should therefore be taken into account in relation to the prohibited substance for the use of EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-probe should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borisssow reported immediately to the Athletics.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under surveillance, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, almost all the weights of the chronic doping nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case of Adrian Zielinski was also known, the London Olympicsman in the class was tested as his brother Tomasz three days ago on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
However, both of them are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of the lights, especially the Danekowa case is a further serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The IAAF World Alliance had prevented the entire Russian population from starting up to an exception because of systematic dopings, as well as Kenya's driving industry producing numerous bad news in Rio.
Furthermore, in the skiing sport, the former departures in China had also provided for heavy landings between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinkelt lila."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to pass it," said Lacourt in French radio.
The Sun also stood in the middle of a siege with Australia's Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for doping bets," he said.
Sun was tested positively on the Stimulans Trimetazidin in 2014 in Chinese masters, but only a trionynatic spree had to be removed.
Data key: So perfectly print your solver hacker
Programmers of pressure malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by Malware-Rebirth Specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies interviewed in the past 12 months have been at least once, partly a victim of an attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies already had the goal of a ransomware erapression.
40 percent of the victims voluntarily paid the ransom money required by the farmers to be able to use the affected systems and data again.
The targets specialize in their peer software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in business networks.
If they are successful there, the potential to express the amount of money is significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently observing a shocking rapid evolution of software," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in the conversation with the "World".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the editors discovered software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks was rapidly taking place in the past months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it is looking for recently modified files such as words, Excel or database files, as well as files of images and videos.
These files lock the ransomware and delete the original sustainable.
The software then presents the demands of the printers.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victim must deliver money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin encryption.
However, where private users have the personal photo database on the game, there are companies with sensitive customer data or project databases that do not support production.
Similarly, the damage occurs when a ransomware is added.
22% of the sales losses reported by ransomware affected by the German companies, 13% even had to completely break down the business, and in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospital homes have already been victims of attacks that may be acutely threatened by the loss of hospitals.
"We always say the victims: don't pay, you just promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again.
For the manager it is difficult, in view of the position of silence in the operation, to deny the demands of the producers.
The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user surfaces and the contact with the sufferers and come to the conclusion: The workers are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to earn more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, turn free of charge support websites into or unlock examples files instead.
And when private people are released after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must deal closely and pay five sums in order to get their data back unencumbered.
In view of the potential high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware pressure, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski by antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware about within one week."
However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.
The programmers then sell their software in the form of a software build-up to the actual printers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a single fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The printers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one of the forums is in the background, buys the set from a criminal, and sends another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made by an infected computer.
"The criminals are again responsible for spammmers with distribution," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known in many companies that better protect their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT officials in the malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to reverse ransomware through file-backs and scanners.
Similarly, new strategies are already being pursued by the producers.
"If the data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful determination alone, the perpetrators are more concerned with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
As a result, damage potential per type of data is much higher than before.
In the future, the producers could also take on the brain a whole new target on the Internet of things.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the free movement of such blocked heating could be such a sacrifice that it would be worth a ransom.
If the producer blocks a whole manufacturing street in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a theme in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little cupé and also the diversity of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually becoming flexible every day.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V is less effective, the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the fund, it does not work at any point.
The materials in the interior are well processed and effective, only the Cockpit surface then falls off something.
More diverse than comparable vehicles is HR-V at the restaurant.
There is not only a coffee room of 453 l in raised and 1026 l in rounded back loans, but there is the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seating areas of the back bank can be raised like Kinosessel and offer from it a restaurant that is from the ground to the roof of 1.24 m high.
The coffee room can be well loaded, however, the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than compared to the 2008 Peugeot.
The 1,6-l-Disel with 88 kW/120 PS speeds the HR-V resulting from the motion up to 300 nm in large-scale driving areas.
However, he had to do something less.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l-benzener with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-radiant drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the link must be something more direct.
The equipment cannot open any desires in the tested top variant "executive".
The safety systems include the City-Notbream Assistant (workable up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Spurhold Assistant.
The Kollision Warner is sometimes irritating because he is assessing many obstacles as "responsive objects".
The telelight assistant works very confidently.
And the intelligent weather ruler reacts to traffic identification and speeds when necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch screens, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are under the armchair and are therefore something to be achieved.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top table are in order.
Anyone who doesn't want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 gas standard.
With HR-V, Honda offers a diverse and daily car.
Airline does not have: storm on the airport bridge
An airline does not have a passenger's seat on the airport bridge for the crash.
Because a liability is likely only when risks are typical of air traffic, the Oberlandegericht Düsseldorf (Z. 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knife when the storm broke.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, so the court did.
The airline had to pay the man no damage.
Disease: If the organizer pays
Sick passengers will only receive money after their trip if the cause of the illness is found in the hotel without doubt.
But that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests prove the same symptoms.
On the second day of their Turkish holiday, a family was severely injured in the accident and crimes.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their disease led the passengers back to a defective clearing system that had apparently contaminated the sea water.
The family was the view that the trip had been slow - and complained against the organizer.
The complainants had no success before the court.
However, the lighting system was actually defective.
However, the organizer is only able to learn soon before the complainants are removed from it.
Until then, he had to leave that seawater was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
No contamination was found in the water samples.
The recovery of several hotel guests - possibly by touching each other - is a general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were injured.
De Maizière said that after the violence experienced by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The State must be seized and decided to respond simultaneously to terrorist attacks.
It is certain: Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hass and division.
This triumph will not be sent to the terrorists.
However, if criminalists are to leave the country faster, it will increase security and strengthen the people's consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 German elections.
He also announced further personal strengthening of the security forces, although "in a medium-sized order of size over several years".
Sympathy for terrorism must be again under punishment.
Video surveillance should be improved so that the law of arms is renewed so that, in particular, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is forced.
The most frequently discussed Swiss duty for doctors should remain in accordance with the Maizières words.
However, he wants to look for solutions in the medical dialogue to reduce the risk of citizens, he said with a view to mental accidents.
In order to prevent the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister has a better social care for them.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of hidden detectors.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to discuss everything that contributes to increasing security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken against actionism.
"This was an insult to the screenmaker in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said to the newspaper of the Funke Media Group (freeday).
De Maizière had previously withdrawn his appeal from the Union after a ban on Burka and the abolition of the double state membership.
A general ban on full-time education was considered to be a problem for constitutional law.
You can't ban everything that you refuse, and I'll stop taking the Burka.
You can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses before court.
Green Chief Simone Peter told the Minister that he wanted to simulate the new anti-terror packages with the effectiveness and ability of action.
Left party Bernd Riexinger said: "Fate speeches and a violation of the right of residence no longer brings security to people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the car router
It is regularly on the surrounding road - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the rule of law should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are on the bus every evening when driving on the road (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16/17), the country's road construction company extended the law enforcement trail to 700 metres between Hammer Street and Weseler Street.
Car drivers can then land directly from the Hammer Street right.
The big advantage: traffic is becoming more early, thereby improving overall on the highly-professional section of the Federal street 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the region represented Münster-West.
The train company on the supplier is especially nervous to the car driver between 17 and 19 hours.
Workdays reach back to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before Weseler Street exit.
From here the traffic will only be driven by the bus bridge.
The second track had to be restored well-induced years ago.
The reason: Statistical calculations have shown that the bridges no longer have the strength required to take up heavy traffic twice.
The duration of this approach and the associated working day-to-day status cannot be stated by the competent country operator.
However, it is to be calculated for years: because the bridge has an official residence period up to 2034.
For the extension of the rule of law, the country company has been aware of the weaker time of transport in the schools because of obstacles to be met.
The transport is carried on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the theatre section "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Union and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
Nima's Association allows young people with the background of migration and refugees to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Children's House has visited a presentation of the award-winning "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Unit of Nima, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the incentration in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the Union, which has aimed at the cultural integration of young people with the background of migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project.
Most young people in the class were from September 2015 to March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the Xenian pictures and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action yet, so the press release of the young Theater Münster.
The Nima's Union, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg in language, and the young theatre will be co-operated in the coming time of play in the framework of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration background should be given the opportunity to visit professionally trained courses in the fields of music, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theaters and thematic language communication are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural travel" continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the association is composed of many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of starring: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the starring gockers in the southwestern Germany at night on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was bad because of clouds and rain, to observe the sky view, said the president of the Stargate Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
In the starships, it is about pedestals, which are within 216,000 kilometres per hour of the fastest starrings.
They have your name because they appear to come from the star image of Perseus, which stands in the northeastern.
Bad night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening, you stay awake for hours at night, and tomorrow you are not to think about bedtime.
That's all other than refreshing.
However, one has such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders occur and more than ten percent feel their sleep more frequently or permanently than not refreshing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders arise?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there may be numerous causes, stressing Hans-Günter Wehet, member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you're trying to understand here is the loneliness, so it's a loss of sleep and sleep.
Many people feel dissatisfied or inadequate, says Jens Carneicht, a member of the board of directors of the German Homer Association with practice in the Dutch version.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
However, organic, mental or behavioural factors can also be associated with medicinal products.
Not rare is sleep disorder an expression of another illness.
"Very early wakes are common in depression," says Wett.
And it can be that different factors are interfering.
For example, someone who has a gang crash can be in bad shape, waits for two to three hours and starts to dig through everyday problems and concerns, there is a white example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
Since when should you have a doctor with sleep disorders?
Whoever is not well asleep for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and is affected on the day should go to the doctor.
The reaction may look quite different: you are tired, tired, unconscious, having difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily resuscitable, have mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
In order to reduce sleep loss, it is important to find out their reasons.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive therapy or even medications - classic sleeping tablets only in the exception and at least for two weeks - questions.
There is hardly any sleep doctor in Germany, said Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep health centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
That is why you should first turn to the housewife when you're having sleep problems.
It can explain with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who's supposed to be in the bedroom, and what's going on?
To study in sleep labs, physicians advise, for example, when cutting with asthma, with severe daily fatigue, with sleep disorders, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, it explains feetze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You were supposed to spend the day normal.
"Please don't make lunch," Fietze says.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest belt and a finger sensor.
In addition, a camera on the deck draws the sleepers.
How can the problems involved get into the grip?
There are quite a number of jobs that you can use for a better sleep.
White number: Regular bedtime and uptimes, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch to sleep, drink or watch the night - then start to count immediately, and that's not even encouraging.
What to do with missing medals in Swimming
The former German skimmer Markus Deibler appeared on Facebook to break up the DSV team at Olympics.
In December 2014, he first held gold at the World Cup in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler, who has been defending himself from his former former teammates in the critical situation.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € premiums and a Dschücken King 150.000 € no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in the swimming sport was bad, but doping controls were very good.
In this way we cannot compete with countries that are very encouraging and doping not look exactly at or even act on the subject.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be put here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Debler had to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how it should be treated with countries.
"If you cannot control a certain time before the WADA/FINA controls, you must not participate," the electoral Hamburger, who is currently carrying out an ice component, demands.
Airport: Bands of packs of tyres
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested on Thursday.
The suspects had started several bags and bags of garbage as a band.
At 21.30 p.m., civil officials in Düsseldorf airport once again recognized a band known to the police from former Düsseldorf.
Since mid-July, the two women and two men have had several duties this year and have been engaged in community, part-time and particularly professionally.
The Specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can testify to four actions by the diets that themselves were involved in the prosecution of crimes in Germany.
In total, they had over EUR 15,000.
Old buildings, a few Lindenbümken, between the rest of the headstone bottle: The Riga road in Berlin-Fridrichshain does not affect the first look, but the police count it to the city's "dangerous sites".
If you go along the road from east to west, you go to playgrounds, a freshly cut children's garden, and a Biolade.
At the fascination of a green house, someone's got a "hässalch!"
A new house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be set up by 2017.
The article about this "terrestrial city area", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain is called, is, however, preferred to be trained by burning cars in the last few weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: First it was occupied, while the inhabitants of the rental agreements, however, there are still rooms in the earthquake and are used for events.
In particular, Berlin's Internal Senator Henkel had repeatedly spoken against the project, calling the area "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On June 22, after the rooms in the ground floor, the cataracts, with 300 police officers, were patrolled by the police for three weeks following official statements by 30 to 40 officers and three men's cars on the ground, stopped parts of the street and stopped visitors from attending the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms at the order of the unknown owner.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the room was illegal, and one day police and construction workers came out under the yoke of sympathians and residents.
On this Saturday afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents go to walk with children, people sit on the city floor before the houses in the sun, others hold themselves in the form of a spati.
In the immediate vicinity of the home projects there is a basic school and children's education.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are particularly proud of the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concerns of increasing rents and entriification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who most of us wanted police protection from vandalizing links.
The graves, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors, are not so obvious.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was a traditional working district, which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
Houses and the housing projects from which they were born are already part of the church: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire main street near the Rigaer.
While the mains were placed under a large police service in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and some are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them people from DDR times and former owners share their Kiez.
This is also reflected in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.
Many of the noveltys in the Rigaer are treated as symbols for this development: they are recognized on inserted discs or freshly carved façades which have been painted with colour buttons.
No other road has been mentioned this year so often with the words "lying autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: sanctions such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed against police.
Most of the punishments result in damages that tend to hit new and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no word of uncertainty.
As regards violence, it is shocking: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who were not certain of it.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer given directly in the Rigaer.
For the studied architects, there is no criminal point of fire, in contrast: "He helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere".
Rehabilitation is deliberately taken into the Rigaer street and stayed.
That is why it was also so important for the inhabitants to get their streets back: from the police, the politics and the media, which suddenly called for the German government to take over the city area in July.
However, in the eyes of residents like Newebuilders, the streets will continue to be taken away: through invisible nubs in former buildings that crush the old inhabitants.
"These are, in the end, property dwellings that are not interesting for many here - they live here more people who are not so well affected," she says.
"I can't be good enough to be angry and destroy."
But what should you do if someone doesn't listen?
There's a frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For zigzags who climb over color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scenes are part of the church.
Whoever takes it should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a bottle can complain badly about anger there.
All persons represented only by names have asked not to be named by their proper name.
Urbach: Annika Dischle is a new refugee mission
Annika Deschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organisation.
She is also a social worker.
Since July, Anika Deschle has been the refugee agent for Urbach.
The Social Paedagogin supports the administration team around Achim Grockenberger.
She looks like a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working circles refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else else.
Kingdom customers from the workplace show that the officials are more grateful than that Godschle is now there, the noble-fashioned cow who has a problem in particular.
In this way, some – less interesting than much more in the number of areas to which the administration wanted to write the place.
An administrative capacity was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in social work, and an exciting wave.
However, administrative work is not her central area, means Annika Deschle.
In particular, it is about organization, work with people in front of and behind the cults as well as networking.
The 31st year has been around six weeks.
She's spent 50 percent of her salary for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Reine Customers that Annika Deschle supports honorary and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are standing in the waterway
A difficult problem has been for some time to find housing for the asylum refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the accession.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.
The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility varies from Landsamt to Kommune and Job Centre.
Problem: There are free items, but not every renter wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been rather difficult for some time.
The fact is that the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until you've been assigned to private apartments, so divine.
Therefore, common housing must be restored, as it is called beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the waterway.
But it's not done with apartments.
Perspective is the word, Queens Customers and Annika Deschle agree.
In addition to a stable stay, there are practical places, training facilities, schools, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regina Customer.
Many work in the building or help house teachers, resulting in joint work - and that motivates and very well, as Annika Deschle reports.
It hopes that work for the Community will lead to a positive external effect.
It's "no employment therapy".
But activity means more than just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Gods and customers.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with natives and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So there's also administrative and honorary intervention here.
It would be central for refugees to feel welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedure is a problem.
They need to explain to refugees that it will take a while and they can spend a lot of time, for example, with language courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he cannot help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, which will never be integrated.
The great majority had been motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "People who are not going to do anything." Therefore, the work of gods and customers is always to motivate others.
It's all a mother's job.
A difficult question: Do the two of them have fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Reine customer quite clearly, "something called nav may." A restriction could and would not exclude them.
But the help has already been sensitized.
These events were also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the interviewer would bring them in full applause.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
This is why the main and honourable members of the region need to keep an overview of the activities.
They have always felt that a new wave of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Do Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is changing.
Actually, it's not fair to put them in place.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach yet where we met," says Annika Deschle.
No new refugees, that would slow down the situation.
Regine customers also make it clear that the urbaners are already equipped to integrate the people of the past.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women are comfortable.
The political world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Shrurdorf: Searched infraggers with Hubschruber
The police officer flew for about an hour from different areas.
Two unknown men were forced into a apartment in a multi-family house on Lindenway on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The inhabitants were surprised by the two and killed the hostages in the flight.
The two men were about 1,65 to 1,70 meters large, perhaps masked, wearing both blue and black caps.
They fled to the city of Innstadt.
In order to arrest the police set up several strip crews, as well as a police officer.
The arrest was unsuccessful.
If so, the unknowns will be able to get close to the apartment in relation to their flight.
Baden-Württemberg: Police reported after Rocker attack on Imbis

Then they should attack two guests and have damaged one easily.
Then they fly.

The investigators are following a dispute in the Ulmer Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
