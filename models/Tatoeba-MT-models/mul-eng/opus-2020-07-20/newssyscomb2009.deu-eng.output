Triumph of the law-political police in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A dramatic weakness of both parties to the previous great coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing parties led to the first preliminary results of the parliamentary elections of the sun in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer, is serious.
On the contrary, the president of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is fighting for a triumphal return to the federal policy.
As a result, social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 per cent of the votes in the country remains the strongest force in the country, but 5.5 per cent of the votes are lost in 2006 compared to the last elections.
Even worse, the OVP cuts by 25.6 percent, which is almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the history of the Austrian postwar war, and especially in the people's party who had requested the proposed elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
In the beginning of July, when the OVP was released from the coalition, the People's Party had a significant lead before the SPÖ.
The voters, however, may have punished the party for letting the government break up.
Already in the first responses to the results there was speculation about a possible return of the party president and former Vice-President Wilhelm Molterer.
Please note that this could already be at an extraordinary meeting of the Chair of the Party on Monday.
Such a development would probably lead to the most likely way out of the electoral framework and thereby to a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) groups, the BZÖ received 18 per cent, the BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes, but the Social Democrats, at the same time, expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party was still united with the populist (at the time the FPÖ was still united, and in 2005 they had been expelled from the BZÖ as regards a common government, even the sanctions on the part of the European Union.
It is clear that Jörg Haider, who has already stated, is ready to work with each party and to return from a return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party, which suffered slight losses and broke down among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent threshold and did not join Parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India can relax
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been charged with the illegal collection of cases in India, it could be, in the view of Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, to a certain rest of the Czech-Indigenous relations.
This was stressed by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukhhardshi.
"If this doesn't work out, then sure, then it's going to get some rest," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukhhardshi said after the talks that in judicial matters the executive could only be serious.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine, the central government wants to join the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the matter is dealt with.
"His problem could be clarified," said the minister.
For Emil Kucherera, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for freedom, Mukhhardshi would be the best if he went to work at a higher court.
He could thus seek release on bail and wait for his trial for freedom, so the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was involved in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal at a higher court, then comes for him a challenge," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way and how the Czech side can be drawn into the whole matter is to call the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in getting good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also give it to," Schwarzenberg pointed out.
At the same time, the Czech Press Agency ČTK, in front of its partner, confirmed the importance of the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
One answer to the question whether he had received the invitation from the Indian side to deal with the matter is the Minister.
"We have already been quite promised," he simply said.
A check goes over the line around the sea background
It comes on an electronic map, drawn from Australia and the surrounding sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it is the limited sea base.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea Law staff.
His head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the explanation and adds it to and added it.
Here's the master of work and enthusiasm.
The sea base is still a little known world, rich in natural sources.
This is where soil oil is to be found, in addition to iron and other non-sustaining raw materials, but also so far unknown living organisms, such as the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the countries of the islanders have largely reported their claim to the new areas of the sea.
According to a UN Convention, they make use of their rights, which they have joined in 1982 in Montego Bay to Jamaica.
This is especially true of the area of the so-called continental slab, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometers far from the edge of a country into the sea.
The Convention therefore has an exclusive claim to all sources of continental damage.
"It is simply expressed that as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its salts, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the sea surface, are considered.
It exceeds the boundaries of the Ufer sea, often also the border of two hundred seams of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to establish the external limits of the continental shelf must be made by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is supported by many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
To date, only the last three countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
At an international corner, Australia's success was short-lived, which, as the first country, was able to increase its sea areas significantly.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was granted to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which means about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The gain they receive in the future from the use of the seabed will be as they promise that they will have an priceless value.
Other countries will also submit their applications in progress.
You can do this ten years from the moment they ratify the "Convention of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean offer, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state in here any more specialization.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold graffiti", says a transfer to Director Mikulka and adds, "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually closed".
Pacific Chechnya
A part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Block within the framework of the Joint Organisation "Interocean metal".
This was due to the Convention in 1991, as well as to the investors of a few other countries, the status of a so-called "trafficking investors".
The organization has the right to promote in the area ClarionClipperton in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The Investor's research area is a bit larger than the former Czechslovakia.
The seabed is located there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"In addition, you can go over a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich base of polymetallic concretes containing Nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, indre Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Division Rober Sandev brings such a convention as a pattern.
It reminds you of a small cardboard or, with some imagination, of the alleged shadow that has developed the legend after the golem to life.
The German special forces were at the time of the release of hostages in front of the site.
The Egyptian government had asked for assistance from Germany to resolve the gas crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they didn't get used.
The conditions of freedom in Egypt of 11 European tourists are becoming more and more detailed.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the rescue action also involved German special forces.
At the same time, both federal specialists and GSG 9 officials were the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Service, and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Task Force at the place of release.
However, the German forces were not required, as ministers were further informed at the Montagabend, because the hostages had let their prisoners run and fled when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to join them as support forces.
"This has not been a success," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry.
Opposers had led the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After the eviction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the geese in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were removed and relocated.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until recently as well as the details of the release or possible settlement payments.
The rescuers arrived in Cairo between well kept.
Steinmeier said that the free geysels were in the obhut of the German message.
For details of the release, he did not express himself.
In Berlin, there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" crew, the five passengers and the special forces are to be deployed with an Airbus of the aircraft and to meet on Tuesday in Germany.
U.S. House of Representatives announces rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has set aside the $700 billion heavy rescue package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones broke into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the Government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all calls by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme that should be included in the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the sponsors were convinced that the critics were still convinced of the $700 billion heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiating leaders, had called on the members to agree, even though the plan was unpopulated.
"It's hard to get political recognition to avoid something that has not yet been introduced," he said.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones introduced more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was the concern of the agents that the State rescue package could be broken.
He responded shortly before the end of the vote, then, after his announcements, to resign again.
Experts are now counting on the international financial markets with further serious turbulence.
For an entry into force of the programme, approval is required both from the House of Lords and from the Senate.
An organizer registers increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travellers:
During travel bookings for the coming months, the turnover has increased significantly in comparison with the previous year, according to a study - even more than 30 per cent for the winter season.
Despite poor conjuncturing prospects, the loss of the Germans of a study remains unsatisfied.
At the bookings for the winter season, the travel offices recorded a turnover of 31% compared to the previous year's period, as reported by the German travel association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
The investigation of the GfK market research institute is also already in line with the number of bookings that have already been increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover of the travel offices for October accounted for about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRV shared with.
Based on these results, the figures of the GfK, which monthly estimates the booking data of 1200 German travel offices and is higher for the overall market.
It is estimated that the travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar rate, special travel to the United States was requested, the DRW shared with.
Here the booking growth is around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic films, were specifically requested by the Germans for travel purposes.
In particular, during the course, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the cost of "costs are better calculated for customers than for individual organised holidays".
Money may be saved by consumers, among other things, by morningbook discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that by the year preceding the year, there will be a resale plus - although according to another study, the number of Germans who take a trip will fall down compared to the previous year.
My first October
Ballermann-Apress-Ski-Hits in the Endless Leather, beer from liter-krügen and promises in designer-Dirndln.
A whisn-debt.
Susanne Kron sugar and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television moderator and wears a moderated dindl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is a second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: almost three minutes on the Wiesen, the photographers are already staring at us and cutting the memory cards completely - very smooth and that at my first visit to Wiesen.
That's how you make friends.
The Billig-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the Whitesquare, the feeling of well-being remained within reach until the date.
But once on the Theresienwiss, everything's half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leatherhosn; no one is hurt or badly touched - everything is completely normal.
The unique sights at the Schokobanen station are only my handshake.
A Munchner reminds me that I had mistakenly bound the tears: "Lefts horse free, middle young woman, forgive right, move behind."
Secretly, I free myself from the back to the left.
"Pass", talk and laugh.
Others make less effort to subtly flirtechniques and wear silhouettes, on which "To drink to get dressed!" and spread the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist Attitudes is named Bob, comes from England, and is also visiting the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long-distance "oooooo".
That's what he tells me after he cleaned up his previous drink.
Right next to one of these Hydrants, of whom everyone thinks he's a milleimer.
So Bob is one of these famous wildlings.
Others do not have the happiness to break free from alcohol in this way.
By eight o'clock in the evening, Healthiers run in close proximity to the place where they have to take care of the poor slums.
The hospital carers are always in the Rudel - always four on one occasion hit an overcrowded trache of Zelt to Zelt.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full return.
Whoever's in the promille sarge under the plan, you don't see.
"These are the ones that pack goarnymmer," one of the healthists called me to ask and disappeared in the pit.
Name of the accident victim known by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being killed by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carol Paulson, who lives in Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of his suspicion of light driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in moving deep into Turkey's territory.
On the east side of the bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest features of this broken, imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance Style.
That's at least what the tour guide tells you.
The building sits at the end of the road with a tower on each side of the front and looks like any provincial German Rathaus.
The stone is drunk.
The whole building is like
But once you are inside the trained driver's car switch, there is no doubt about the existence of the project, whose most western access was this.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a latecomer in the imperialist game, had before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East through a train to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany gained imperialism during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of his surrounding region, created by the inviolable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and pressed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway.
In 1917 a munitions waved into the air, where the artificial roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was Saturday.
Since then it has slowly fallen, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolicly, serves as a tower for Anatolias and especially east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
A policy of approach now prevails.
Noteworthyly, the Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the echo data of this new foreign policy, I have spent the night in the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Suat Kiniklioglu, Turkey's coordinator, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a semi-trailing ride on ice that produced the same pace of the old world in the famous document "The Night Mail", I came to the Turkish capital, which will be seen as a new city for the new world state projects, the past of the Osman.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish unity
This has solved some of the mysteries in the west, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main business of the AKP, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing city, surrounded by semi-manufactured shopping centers and buttons in which middle managers, both men and women, met to close the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost every other political party in Europe.
Come on, Krawatt, I'm sure he's even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the Party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its continent.
Today they have to look to the east and west at the same time.
It does not give either one or the other.
You had to do both.
"But I'm sure Turkey could ever decide," I asked, "was it forced to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then made a point above, which almost everyone I spoke to here said, almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are of the same benefit for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, as the message seems to be, Europe can, in a transferable sense, travel as a whole on the eastern coast of Asia and the Middle East as a whole.
Back at Hydarpashas Railway Station, after a very long sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had been looking at the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East can now be widely shared in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the railway station, which should bring me back over the bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man Europes."
At least at the time, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In mind Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus in the following year.
He was thought of as young as 21 years of age, but when the choir in 1979 was the last time some of us were already at the end of 20 - we refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological exchanger) was for the readiness and ability of the choir to take any piece of music presented to him, regardless of whether it was a medal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young Chores was often surprising, always exciting and lasting alone and alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been read over the years.
How often did death cause us to "let the music speak for themselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His nature of the director was absolutely clear and precise, but never overstepping.
As the music level was always high, he always demanded a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any director had been shot at the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've been writing criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was the rare combination of size and personal information.
He rejected the leaders who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two famous sheepmen in the world."
So many of us are going to lose him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your address for William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), you write that "in 1946, the teaching of economic history in Oxford was renewed and in 1950 a Houblon-Norman research scholarship was awarded ... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from a note by the author in Woodruffs book "Jeens since the end", however, it does not agree.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British Kautschukin industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published as the "British Kautschuchins industry" in 1958.
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 on the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to replace this part of his driveway.

'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their wickedness and the power they display, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of the outstanding sale at Honda.
In November, Honda began marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior area, these large spaces also offer a significant increase in size.
This includes the technical features that allow even more convenient vehicles and petrol to be saved.
Amendments to the previous revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessors, the changes that have been made in these large limos have been numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be emphasized.
However, before starting to analyze the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
Following the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturer, was able to restore this model for a short time.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, a million models were sold alone in Japan.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates were 10,000 cars, which are 17% of the growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the directors of the branches in Spain expect to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
Takes a closer look at the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to replace the sales discount in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. These are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by 1.8% over the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda sets out a new model.
It is about Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the view on the market is expected for the first month of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
In view of the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 cm ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 cm) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 cm larger.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
In addition to increasing the dimensions, the interior will also be expanded.
This success is, on the one hand, the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in the driver model of Jazz.
The capacity of the coffee room, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, thus 19 litres greater than the capacity of the coffee room of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre of petrol engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz coffee room is 1,2 litres of petrol engine 379 litres.
Among other improvements, in addition to additional equipment items such as leather seats or the possibility of a panorama window, improved access to seating is offered.
The opening angle of the interiors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of his marketing year, this small model has 2 performances of petrol engines: 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system that enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance, and at the same time provide strong driving performance for the entire engine time.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6000 rotations with maximum speed of 114 nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the driver's model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 output of 125 grams.
In view of the driver's engine, which reached the previous generation 83 PS, it is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Bine', avoiding collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for disaster prevention, Nissan was this time inspired by nature, specifically by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight back to the black behavior of bees and prevents accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for disaster prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the leader of technology-PR and R&D-brand management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-legged Nissan security shield.
This robot should ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own ovarian plane, which is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important are the face waves of the bees, which can be seen across a 300-degree angle in all directions, which enables them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to develop the roundup perspectives, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that are at BR23C at a distance of up to two metres and are at a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to a coastal microprocessor that is transmitted directly in a signal for the prevention of collision
`At the moment when obstacles are observed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to other systems is that this switchman is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'toshiyuki Andoh, director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither go up nor down, but not across; he can only move on two dimensions and to the direction that enables him to turn his wheels and not into the infinite directions and in an infinite way, as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used rotation functions in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions to prevent the small robot from colliding.
`This device needs only a few seconds to process the information and to act on these data.
It does not require either the information or the intuitional logic of the abovementioned manoeuvres, so it can continue to work with just a few thousand KBs of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts in the next ten years to introduce in the seriesautos.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and hold longer than the multitude of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal and avoid obstacles on the way.
She's on her seat before she's burdened with a hypothetical.
It must be noted that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without a message.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the development of US citizens in mortgage stories of the supposedly eligible banks, a sustainable and informative game was developed for the Internet source: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it is.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credit' or the other way around.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think about one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She must have useful information, but without details.
This is more than a page for the teen than a place for all viewers.
What happens when the game is extended?
Now, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house

Morgan Stanley announced the introduction of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and take over 21% of its capital, an update to be carried out in a strong case of its profit.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stamps will be purchased at a unit price of $25.25, making a total of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price of the share as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will guarantee you a 10% profit and can be resaled at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be carried out on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, thus 28% over the current price.
The Morgan Stanley Act, however, fell against 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business in new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
It also confirms that the current financial crisis requires the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more predictable attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: Morgan had mistakenly declared that they would sell up to 20% of their shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'A week ago' explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, 'We thought that the participation would be entirely stemmed from strains.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley shares below their price.
And the business will be allowed to reduce the profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement stipulates that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into stamps if the latter are replaced by more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, thus about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the money provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities to strengthen their balance and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more detailed information on the strategic objectives of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to sell a payment capacity rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance has been reduced since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group that had to look at how it returned to half its salary, while the price for insurance against payment capacity was fast.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only "liver" of the big investment banks on the Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, to have taken part in Berkshire Hataway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this morning in Quito.
The Republic of the 21st century has given rise to socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
The third was the one that followed this Sunday, the example of his peers and friends, the plan of a new constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because according to 80% of the public results of the electoral votes, 64% voted in the referendum with `Yes'.
As a result, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the list was invalid and 0.7% were given empty.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, a vote must be taken more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two questions were conducted at the elections and a number of non-governmental organizations announced a clear victory for `Yes' and 63% to 70% of the prophecy.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had asked for the victory of his constitutional projects.
In Guayaquil, the “consistency has triumphed over,” he has protected and freed the Ecuadorians from the seat of the government of 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa of Chávez and Morales was congratulated by his Chilean equivalent Michele Bachelet.
The choice, which was maintained in accordance with the observer board of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on an existing text of 444 points for the protection of the 'new socialism' for which the President applied.
The draft Constitution confers on the economy the exclusive right to 'development planning' in a country, which is largely based on the promotion of land by foreign companies and the loans sent by the displaced to the country.
The project carried out by selected Correa in 2006 is also subject to more comprehensive powers, which can be exercised by up to two consecutive mandates every four years, and will have the opportunity to resolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will pursue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education that the President has already begun to implement in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also proposes to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will prepare the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian position as a starting point for American anti-drogen systems.
The 19 villages were set free in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the leader of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were arrested ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for 11 days, were healthy this afternoon and brought back to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the geysels reached the al-Maza military base directly near Cairo's international airport at 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter in the hospital of Maadi, a foreign quarter of Cairo, to be examined there.
They are pleased with all 'best health' and the drivers 'no money paid', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the role field.
After she was arrested on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, on the ground-car Safari, the group of villages was always brought back to a close by 35 unknown drivers.
It is about eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian Agency, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, had launched the attack at night, shortly before the dawn.
'On both sides, shots and half of the driver were killed, the rest of the flights,' said this responsible man who wants to stay anonymous.
He explained that all 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanders.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he was right about the role of the secretaries and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionality and performance of our men from secret service and from special units', he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom has been paid.
The previous night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle at a patrol, in which the exporters, six of whom, including the drivers from Chad, were killed and two arrests.
The army stated that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the movement of libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), which is currently in conflict with this movement.
Letter - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture leads to dividends and is central to the current election struggle.
So it's better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in ignorance.
Who will rise and start the bitter sums that will be given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that claim to be burned?
What politicians are going to be able to remind the Federal Government that they are slowing down their monuments and their culturally important construction works?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, which effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government makes EUR 3.5 million available alone and alone for the restoration of the Chinese castle in Loiretal?
Our American neighbors are writing in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this culture must be protected by all citizens, officials and all government districts, and that it must be protected by mutual consent.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical companies Quebecs, at least 40,000 officials gathered in 211 historical societies strive to be intensely involved with the history of saving the numerous private archives with a few Greeks, and to receive the archaeological remnants.
They are also often the guards of our culture, who protest with the power of doubt when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten peace ceilings.
When will there be a stage for history and culture?
Benelux government Fortis Bank
In part, the Benelux states of the Belgian and Dutch Fortis Bank, which was hit by the US financial crisis in Turbulence, want to be caught under the armaments: the three States provide the Bank and Insurance Institute, which also has loans in Hungary, totalling EUR 11.2 billion.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the officials of the European Commission's competition authority.
In the euro area, fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has existed for a year, so decisions that may have a presidential character in relation to the bank.
In the light of the decision taken on Sunday, all three States purchase the bank's respective shares by approximately 49 per cent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its shares, all of which have been purchased in the last year by the Dutch ABN Amro insurance activities.
The shares of the Fortis have started a massive Talfahharth last week, and in the second half of the week there were already serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too big with its 85,000 employees for a plot.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% on a 14-year-old basis on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen to more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rate, the group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which is said to be unrealistic.
According to the management, USD 700 billion is valuable American rescue package and the uncertainty generated by it on the markets is due to the tax rate of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses were slightly increased.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it has not found any interest in a professional offer.
The Belgian government was trying to ease the situation - no agent should sit around his money, he said.
There has been no panic among the customers that the branches of the bank have not been shaken.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls Leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the back seat
Because of the drug consumption of a person, in America life and health insurance often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts feared that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that relate to the use of medicinal data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be independent, otherwise we trust the footman" - quoted by Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the follow-up of description data.
Insurances shall determine the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage, depending on the customer's health, and should the risk be underestimated, the insurance shall not be terminated.
Earlier, the customer was sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick found a far more valuable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data in the last half of the years from the apothecians, which were purchased, and the program calculates what the customer's disease is and how it is healthy.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol from non-medicine, it would be possible to ensure that his blood fat count is untreated, which would automatically select him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the process - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance needs to be made more than the paper framework, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the ingredients is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraine and fever, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the perspective of the insurance policy, while not mentioned above.
For the question and processing of data, companies have formed their own societies, which, before they relate to the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though exemptions have not yet been granted.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them with the data on the drug consumption, thereby providing a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more firms have access to the data, and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
While there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to health providers and insurance.
The draft legislation has already been submitted to the Congress, in which the authorities can also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard notes that this is too small, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can be submitted only with the understanding of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned could hardly deny access to his data, since insurance would not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And that's how the hunters just left some of the favor of the bird.
Global eating plan from Marseille
European Union and India duplicate trade
Since the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French Indian summit is also taking place, where cooperation is mainly discussed in the nuclear sector.
The European Union recognises that India is an ambitious, democratic power that should be given more votes and the right to speak in international cases, but it is still not possible for the Member States to agree whether or not they should support the continued membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the nine summits in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received an agreement with the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 to 55 billion, this objective is not even that ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing Civil Aviation Agreements with India were legally incorporated into an agreement so that future air traffic will also be evacuated.
By 2009, India wanted to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the package.
The aim is to create a balance between the EU and India, while the Union of the partner number of India is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to the global events.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in relation to terrorism, which was condemned on both sides. The call for a UN conference was also called for.
The Doha Rounds should also be closed, where both sides bear the blame.
The EU stressed that it was included in its energy and climate programme, which means that waste emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
In this way, India agreed, as well as with the proposal, to conclude a kind of global compromise in the coming climate crisis and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be fought, so both support the introduction of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is today visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that contracts with French companies will be worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
The agreement should be concluded by means of an agency notification for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian dealers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian contractor at the Frankfurt Buchmesse International.
More than 300 Italian lawyers will be present at the 60th Book fair, the most important international event for law enforcement.
The international Frankfurt Book fair is expected for the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition and presented over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the proudst of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair will follow: at this time, figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the layout in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign authors in general, especially in adult and youth parties, is taken into account.
A year ago, the lost little plane of the billionaire Steve Fossset
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, which was discovered on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The individual parts have been found at a height of 3000 m, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the Federal states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains in the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully confirmed the last doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been located, a crew has been sent. Now we have the security that it's about the plane with which Steve Fosset is flying on the day of his departure."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) informed that a man was dispatched a few hours after the aircraft was hit by a machine that identified him: it was about the Bellanca 8kcab lost on 3 September 2007 after Fosset in Yerington in Nevada was launched into a 3-hour flight.
Last night, in California, near the border with Nevada, some of the personal items of Fosset were found from a couple near their home at the Mammoth Lakes.
There are two references to the name Fossets, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, bar money and a jacket.
The search for Fosset was completed a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002 he was the first man to turn the world ball around in a flight balloon: a two-week, single flight.
Three years later he flew around the world in a single flight without an interlocutory landing with a plane.
Among its ethnic record is an altitude of 15445 m above the wind, however, with a co-pilot.
Look, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls through its original design and the special line management, the outer surface and its clear angle fall from the usual scheme.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to attract the new Atem sector with this offerer.
Because of its extraordinary features, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also appear unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the Mercedes-Benz showroom.
Thus, the advertising troms that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in new clothes, i.e. in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a news in the car sector in remote Italy.
A project with a high-end project to be carried out at various stages, which will be taken by the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como, which should give the glove a special perspective: the new suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear out of the plate on which it is painted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk in different moments, it will shed light on all its details to reassemble it as a whole.
It is undoubtedly the case of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new type of car advertising in this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interests of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – they are now at risk of ban on stadiums
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, who are all in Italy now ashamed of themselves? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been traveling back to the Italian National Mission for years and that, honestly, has not yet caused serious problems.
It never happened to meet with gay fans before.
The origin of the group is in the right millennium.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, there are other smaller groups from campaigns and apulias.
They carry the tricolor, which appears to the cities of the militias: they were removed on Saturday, however, to avoid identification.
Your examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria it now came into contact with a truly radical fan of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans had 144 cards available for the game: all were displayed on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: no one was among those who traveled to Sofia with a ongoing ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian men who had already been introduced in this regard were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
The Viminal is now waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified typhosis may be subject to a stadium ban for at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is a fear of neighbors who can follow them at least 150.
"This brand has to be expressed around, and this behaviour does not give the possibility of justification," it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "Avoid especially with regard to the game of the National Mission on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in April there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sportview) will be gathered, on Tuesday the Cassms, which can be counted on part of the Asia, so the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the Hymme of Mammel? This is no punishment in Bulgaria..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (taken by the posts of Francisco Tagliente and Felice Ferrizzi).
Formerly, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the support of Ultras Italy, founded in 2002.
Although it is true that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but it is doubtful that the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – add paragraph 1 of the Osservatory – crimes will be committed in the country of action.
So far this group had remained in the zoo, but now it has to be overlooked what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pimps during the Hymne Mamelis: this is also not a punishment, but they allow me, because the education is missing....'
