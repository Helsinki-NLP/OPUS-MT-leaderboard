Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will be involved in Oslo in Norway for 26 hours and will be the fourth American President of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
His $1.4 million will be awarded to him for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The head of the White House as well as his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian Metropolis in the morning and will have a program.
He will first meet with the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected him in October of 172 persons and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then arranges for an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will take place in the afternoon at a solar ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third will see the price in the Committee itself.
The White House reported that Obama was talking about the war in Afghanistan at the time of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this price by being a president who is waging war in two countries at the present time.
It reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of its critics would forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million euros).
He is responsible for giving charity works, but he has not yet made a specific decision.
Her program was then held by her husband and her husband to a banquet that included, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reticent at this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned that he did not feel worthy of it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he said it would be a "invitation to act" for him.
A defencer of the accused nature of canning
The Litomérice Police accused the president of the Litomèrica Society of Protection of the Nature of Litomèrica.
Several times in the last year, he appealed for several construction works and requested the money from the investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, Alena Romová, a spokesman for the Litomérice police.
The President of the Society for the Protection of the Nature of Lithuania is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk for up to three years of imprisonment.
Three-thirds of waste are not in perfume in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their packs of drinks, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on triangular beds on each side of the street.
And Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you find the right legs.
I don't mean we wouldn't choose all waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the age of stone of three wastes not only because citizens can choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of beddings dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's all science, which requires most of the time and nerves of steel.
The only place I found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Anderka and his colleagues don't want me, but I don't think so.
Without talking about the fact that in other districts of the city, it is no longer a synergy.
So to end, many of my friends don't take their losses.
Looks like it.
It makes them proud to get to bed.
I don't care about them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to throw some bottles of wine and PVC.
Except I saw no color line in Kounicova.
Fortunately, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That's what it said, the wastes were out of it.
It's after all the center of Brno, who's supposed to be the best city, isn't it?!
It is likely that environmental and supposed aesthetic interests are not too much for socialists in Brno.
They prefer to buy in the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying some extra beads and offering the three-fold increase of raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after having spent some time on the Internet.
According to the data from ECO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of all the South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has benefited from the withdrawal of money and sick leave.
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or officials may lack the money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of the next year, Minister for Finance Edward Janato said.
When social Democrats and Communists imposed an increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive expenses, retirements or sick leave. "It is not just to solve the problems later, to reduce the land," Janata said.
It is important to know that the interest on money has increased and that it will need to be restored sooner or later.
The State does not really have the choice to know where to get the money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those on the left has now increased: pumps, institutes, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their withdrawals or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger State start - the next year it will not miss 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janato, the debt will grow faster and with it, costs related to interest will increase.
The State will need money to repair it and it will no longer suffice to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
It will also lack five billion to complete road and railway construction due to the transfer of money to some electoral groups.
This is mainly due to already decided and determined conclusions that it is not possible to modify projects to reduce any costs.
As long as you keep them, that's not free no more.
This means delayed or stopped 30 large buildings, and the removal of European funds is also in danger, according to the maintenance of Karel Hanselka, the port of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed to address the very fair financial deficit - it will be in the dividends of the ČEZ (electric supplier and distributor), that the State has most of it and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case of an empty hole.
Last year, this is 18 billion which have been sailed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damages, to complete retirement accounts, or to reserve for the reform of pensions that are prepared.
In addition, this trend increases the actual deficit of the budget of 5.7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crimes, including housing savings, has fallen to almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we miss an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janata.
The Minister will then have to save the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the Government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of 100 million in the draft State cache of a value of two billion, which must be able to monitor online what the costs of each administration are.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance had no money anymore, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to pass from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that were revealed seemed promising.
It's enough for a button and you can spend Windows Mobile in Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the opportunity that is the objective of the American company VMware, which is mainly concerned with developing software for virtualization for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them personally and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of the last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not necessarily reflect fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which was simultaneously running the above-mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is very high.
VMware now cooperates with European and American operators to test virtualisation on smartphones, and customers should have access to devices running 2012.
The snowfall in the mountain tracks the hotels
Deforested tracks are not a problem for farmers only.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their stay on skis in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to denounce free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our website.
Internet users cover offers, demand prices, but do not have to make a reservation for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask for it if there will be snow or cloud in Noël," said Martin Jandura, exploiting the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is best not too late to book.
If the economy is given priority and the quality of the accommodation is only followed, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hotels offer only one week's stay for the New Year.
I think they'll try again to please them, but they'll also sign and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura loved.
The Ingtors du Vrchlabí tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is most interesting for the moment, it's not completely sold.
It remains free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared a few Christmas days less expensive," said Ingtors Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency may also propose the New Year in Krkonosche, but there are fewer places available.
The fourteenth days of February are going well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays was negatively affected by the fact that there was always no snow in Krkonosche.
People expect her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are recovered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the contrary, the occupation of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We've got an improvement of almost five percent.
It remains a few last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest in Janvier's vacations from Poland and February's well-selling also," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking area of Jánské Lázní is also full of twenty-four percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain alive in Noël in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already had six percent of employment at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment, but as the snow falls, interest for the residents in the Krkonoše will certainly increase even more has indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hotels, however, do not have to expect more snow.
Thursday will make it more expensive and if there are precipitations, they should be snowy in the mountains.
However, the time should be set aside, reports Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometric institute.
United States: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
He also became comical, the effort he put in place with which Barack Obama, a wise representative, re-produced his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered to be very simple.
When he ended up leaving his doctrine to be transpired, he found that he had copied it to the carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
It is not happy to use the phrase "like in Iraq" in the same text several times, but it does not hesitate to use the title of the speech of Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new strengths into a civil war-consuming Iraq as "responsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which followed the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely success in that the current newspapers do not speak of all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that is, obviously speaking, leaving his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will occur
This is again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even strongly criticized the reticences of the White House despite subordination habits.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President has been angry for three months but, in the absence of a better option, he has left at least 10,000 soldiers behind.
It has succeeded in eradicating the promise of 5,000 additional Europeans, even though it originally accounted for 10,000.
What is the biggest problem in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw Afghanistan's weapons 18 months ago and end all this process for three years. Obama's doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase in half will bring the same results as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, which tend to change from day to day according to their arrangements.
The political institutions, although officially established, will only remain in the back of the dust which will expand patriot ethnic relations.
It is simply difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complex by the Palestinian and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "fast state of action", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy makes its volunteerism very impressive.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it impossible and it is currently on the coast of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent to the battle tower for their "prompt return to the house" will come there with a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible because the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect possession of the American deficit.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan has led to negative results.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically change the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the most difficult issue of a solution to the problem by resorting to military force.
For example, it will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will return to the victorious retreat of the Afghan troops.
However, each such solution will result in a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only Russian for Obama is the fact that it remains for three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it to embark on a new strategy, where it would appear to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers will no longer receive cash prizes
The high-ranking employees of the U.S. Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive premiums in species.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms about its work practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to repay five years ago.
Actions can be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too much risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus puts himself in the head of the effort to deal with long-term performances in Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning he has to take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the JPMorgan company.
The concern is found in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after almost $17 billion has been paid for premiums over the first three trimesters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite today's announced measure, according to Reuters.
With the coming of the financial crisis, the strong branches of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
The United Kingdom announced Wednesday that it would have a single rate of 50 per cent of the banker's bonus over 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have received Nobel Prizes in all areas of physical harm
These are five women, a number of records, who have received today in Stockholm the hands of King Charles XVI of Sweden's Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider have received with their partner Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was assigned to Israeli Ada Jonathan with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and function of the ribsomas
The last laureate received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and his partner Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a laureate this year was physical.
This price has been paid today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD bees, which are currently based on all digital cameras, fax or astronomical planets.
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (about EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them bears several laureates, they will share the reward between them.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been sent this afternoon to Oslo in Norway to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his course and was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is necessary to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota intends to resign. Klaus invited her to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Edward Janato tomorrow, who will take his seat in the Government because of his disagreement with the budget of the State for the next year as he was voted by the House of Members
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janata's position at the office will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the crisis of public finances.
This is the speech of President Radim Ochvat who reported on the meeting.
Janata wants to discuss her work Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus's signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion dollars that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Members has approved the left-wing proposals for money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of democratic socialists because they were going to increase the budget deficit indirectly.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left, the government, Klaus and the right of the other party, which called for the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members, deletes the package of economic measures passed by the Government of Fischer and, according to it, must end the state's identity.
Klaus, who can ratify the State budget law but who is not obliged to do so, said today, in a small day of discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long ignored the "severe problem" of the "unrepentable deficit" of public finances.
Now, he says, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement, if it could support a broader political party consensus, according to the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget was changing and that the government should re-examine its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Verts is not clearly functioning anymore.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolánek is rising and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Mercredi has already successfully qualified ČSSD for the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that the major roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Invaincu will reveal much about the country, its battles and its winners.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor who won the Oscars, filmed Nelson Mandela's life, inflexible against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that he was a Mandela, a 14-year-old man who asked him to take him into the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to take you in, I should be able to see you personally.
The aged actor of sixty-two years who was rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Millions Dollar Baby drama is located in the middle of the box, for example, incarcerated the leader of a movement against slavery became his own slave, a president of the United States fiction, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never one of the living and so important ones as many people as Mandela is.
The former South African state man was sentenced to 27 years in prison for his work in favour of the end of the apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and has been president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invasive and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true history of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and of the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The president of Mandela has recently chosen to know that his country remains and is still divided racially and economically after the apartheid.
He is persuaded to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to join the rugby players who are among the outsiders at the world level.
The South African team will end up making progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to generate Mandela's story on a large screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in bringing it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in college before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to lock his hand.
I realized that when I close my hand, I recover from your energy, it passed and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national team of rugby where there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the middle of the rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I called at the door of the house, he opened me up and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, "I've got a lot bigger air in the film."
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus, under the auspices of Eastwood Realiser, received positive advice and even expressed ambitions for the Oscars.
The movie critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very successful film."
In film evaluations on the Rottenatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a fuse
We have been able to observe a strange phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized that yesterday had tested an intercontinental ballistic fuss near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" kind of mission, which was originally due to be the height of the Russian army, gradually became the cover of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in merger tests did not have the expected effect on the success of pilot flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't get involved, or she fell in full flight.
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as a "missile that doesn't fly"
A Missile who doesn't want to, but who shines
The 13th test was normally started.
It's only at the end of the flight that there's been any damage to the device.
It's apparently the engine of the third floor of the Fusada that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" was involved in the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of Missile can just be fitted with a moving and loaded ship.
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by a flying object not specifically identified has probably been a defective "Bulava".
The rest, the Norwegians have no doubt that this is a Russian merger.
The generals argue that this time, we can't say anything wrong.
The first two stages of the fusion were resistant, and the evaporation only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were aware of failure on the first floor.
Although none of the tests were conducted without delay, the Department of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirty were errors.
This success rate of almost 50 per cent therefore complements the generals of optimism and they therefore maintain that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and will even bring ten hypersonic nuclear ships of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a contract of a year with the Moscow CSKA in 51 years
The legendary champion Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year professional match.
The former champion of the world, the Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will hand in hand with his team from the Moscow CSKA in need and will probably make his entry at the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who finished his career in 1998 for 40 years, is the president of the CSKA for the time being.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is regularly trained and is willing to help the team.
We still have to set up some details on the form, declare the team's coach Sergey Nymtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fatissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played for Hartford for a whole season and received 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous fifth fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he has doubled the gold to the Olympics, seven World Championships, he has triumphed at Canada Cup as well as the junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected hommings in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the temple of the renowned hockey.
Hyundai heard the unions and cancels all the extra hours
The management of the Nošovice Hyundai plant agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
This is precisely because of the frequent extra hours the unions have declared a state of emergency Monday.
Peter Vanék's speech port of Hyundai is confirmed.
However, the management wants to agree with the unionists on a Saturday that still worked this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential that additional hours of voluntary work were proposed on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there were two teams, Vanék said.
The website Sedmička.cz indicated that the company proposed 400 Czech Crown bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be assigned to the post office for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaník, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Whether they receive the supplement for more hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28th, and thus extend their final annual holidays to Vanék.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and breakfast.
Given that the additional hours were the most urgent and hottest in the comments and demands of trade unions as employees who had suddenly stopped production last week, Vaník said that the management decided immediately to cancel all additional hours for December.
Up to the last week, the car's employees were forced to work almost every day for almost two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions shall cancel the strike status after signature of the agreement.
The following negotiations between the driver of the vehicle and the trade unions must take place on Friday after noon.
The union leader Petr Kucharí said that they were ready to cease the strike status if they agreed on their claims and signed a common document.
The situation in the facility has deteriorated recently when nearly 400 employees have been spontaneously injured because of increasing hours.
They also protested against the bad terms of pay and claims of boutiques.
The management defended the fact that employees had to work additionally to fill the car production imperatives.
In the announcement of the Monday strike, trade unions also requested that employees who had ceased production should not be subjected to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent at least additional hours.
In addition, this year they want to pay 5 000 crowns (about €209) for them.
The vehicle Hyundai de Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles up to September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on the HIV virus "permanent" as well
A team of Czech and German scientists tested new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also deals with viruses that have already developed drug immunity.
This reality, in some cases, is based on the fact that the combination does not necessarily affect the current variants of the virus, even though some medicines are already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of patients can be radically extended through a combination of medicines that prevent the increase in HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a number of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has resulted in the development of what is called resistant viruses that no longer have any effect on drugs.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to address the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that methylcarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a mixture of wood, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination inhibits the development of viruses in a different way from all medicines used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
Researchers are working to discover new "improved" substances on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links to the proteins of the virus.
The metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two layers of multiple pairs are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treatable and resistant virus.
HIV protein is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, there would be no birth of infected particles of the virus.
If HIV is banned, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pair of boxes (cf. table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in trials as well as in its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
In the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarbons is not as strong as the clinical drugs, but it does not weaken the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Therefore, with their unique action mechanism and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are interesting combinations to consider further to address the introduction of effective anti-AIDS drugs, says Pavlína Rēzáčova, director of the structural biology laboratory of the organic chemistry and biochemistry institute and of the molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
debate about the budget. The ODS takes them to Fischer, who defends themselves.
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, has qualified as "equating" the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should resign because of its existence.
The Prime Minister qualified for the ODS of a drastic impact.
He said take time to analyze.
The ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens Party was not clearly functioning anymore.
According to Nečas, the Head of Government should decide to join the House of Members in support of the minority who is concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the help of the Parliamentary Left.
Nečias warned that the positions of ODS and democracies in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Members has ratified the budget for 2010, however, with proposals for amendments of up to 12 billion corrons included in the left.
The House increased the money allocated to employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's complaint against the proposals of democratic society was the fact that they were indirectly increasing the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion dollars.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the government's wishes as a modified budget is a less bad variable than an interim budget.
Deception and ineffectiveness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janata spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
It is no doubt that if Janata threatened to leave her functions in the event of ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janato took your meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday after his visit to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he asked whether he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget was the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budgetary deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed budgetary changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the Chamber ratifys other laws that increase deficits, such as those affecting sickness insurance, pensions, or the reform of the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not responsible.
It's the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, highlighted Topolánek in a text communication from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of some departments complained of TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decided to give up his resignation in the face of a fight against the amount of public finances deficit, "it is indeed logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
That said, it must not wait for the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and once it's on the agenda then I'm going to dedicate it to it, the House has told journalists, Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
The first Minister Fischer called on the afternoon for a debate by the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS left at the request of the Prime Minister.
She pointed out at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the modified budget if it did not specifically ask Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel like orphanages, we are not small children, we have responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been challenged by the President of the Party in the Chamber or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I didn't notice that my vote would have been wrong.
I knew already when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the months to come would be the collapse of the House and the destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek would react personally.
According to the new hours of the ČD, there will be less trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will delete or limit from 13 December some of the less-favoured or regional trains and will strengthen them against some others.
The total coverage of transport will be reduced by the date of entry into force of the new two per cent hours compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
These are, for example, the residents of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Iron Roads will take a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an expression ceased to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less quick trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budéjovice line, the Prague - Letohrad line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové of eight per cent in total, unlike Prague and its environments, can be seen as an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budéjovice line are also cancelled and the movement of some trains express on the Prague - Písek - České Budéjovice line will be reduced to just a few days a week.
One of the biggest transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko bathroom system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electricitying of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nadraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines of SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains for Šumperk/Jeseník will start at two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional pipelines.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will be sent to the Roads next year in any four billion crowns to fix visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion in the next year, knowing that the State will participate at least three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have again signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration has been one year.
The Roads to Make appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not resort to an increase in the price of the large majority of transport tickets.
The changes will affect only the tickets of a day ČD Net and the internet tickets reduced eLiška.
For passengers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the road trajectory, while until it was valid between cities of a region at choice and was at a single rate of 160 korrones.
The Philippines's rebellion is still holding more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have taken 75 people to the southern Philippines today, including some students from a primary school and their institutions.
It's the AFP agency who reported it, but who spoke to the source of only 65 o'clock.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the institutes.
The arrest took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human bugs when they fled to the police.
Local negotiators were now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police have first pursued the rapists because of the violence caused in a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Magiandano in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the governor's election were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatuans.
The Mindanao island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they have renewed peace talks with the Philippinesn government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns the whole world, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in American rooms in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the official title of the Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells of a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the world-known apartheid was returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to take it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the criticisms and the public are becoming heard.
Nelson Mandela
He was born on June 18, 1918 in the United States in South Africa.
In 1988 he obtained Sakharov's prize for his freedom of thought, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize at Klerk's side.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is fully prepared to cut the football world, and on the other hand because the media are alarmed by new concerns about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination among the people of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations raised to the main roles of Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the film by repeating his own terms.
I've been dreaming of this role for years, and I've been well prepared.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally to be able - as it is said - to recover from his energy, he said at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but that is what each individual wanted.
Take the email from the national team of rugby
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin is the title that is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the part that has given his creation to the people, he represents the South African human rights defender during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to collect two racial groups of a long-term divided population, as well as Nelson Mandela, in 1995 he was among the national mail of the South African team on the world's football field, which South Africa had then won.
In order to be shown on the Maillet poleuse, which is considered to be something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been protracted for a long time since 14 years mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white people.
Hopefully, the football champion will be able to reunite people into one nation, said the rugby Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to see if the situation in South Africa is going to improve.
The South African whites, however, are as sceptical as the recently entrusted to an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a fan of rugby who has gone to Great Britain.
The campaign begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of flames in the Louny region
A fire took place in the morning as a transformer of the Cheps company from the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov in Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the port of the Ustí pumps, there are six units operating on fire.
They wanted to let the transformer consume themselves, but they reviewed their opinion and burned the fire with a mixture of water, muse and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal circuit of the transformer.
No one has been hurt, and according to Paula Mandátova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe functioning of the whole transmission.
The damages are estimated to be a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is over.
According to Mandátova, the transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, the company Čeps has not known anything similar and that the incidents of this type are isolated.
The supply of electricity has not been interrupted, declaring ČEZ's spokesman for the North Boheme of Sonā Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of ovens, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire of the transformation station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution posts with 67 transformers transferring electricity from all transport to distribution sets and line traces of a length of 4339 km.
Jančura will complain for diffamation against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jancura, owner of Student Agency, will present today a complaint against three democratic social prefectures.
And specifically against Michal Haszek of the South Moravia region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region, and the chief of the Olomouc region, Martin Tesarík.
Jançura indicated it in the Dvacet minute of RadioJournal.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to exploit regional railway routes in some regions.
However, all regions have concluded by signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and said that we were done with the ends of the mouth, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we love more than the ways of making checks that is not true because we know the prices of the ways of making checks that have been signed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It is in exchange for colleges on the Student Agency, Jancura said in Radiojornal.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We will prepare a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Hashek considers that Mr Jančura's complaint deposit is the result of his media show that serves him as a free publicity for his society and for his person.
I am very willing to defend my name and the name of my region and call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is just Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek says.
Jančura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in a publication that will mention the disadvantages of the regions.
He told RadioJornal that he interrupted the campaign after Christmas and that he was counting on it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would mean corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Roads to check the operation of railway links for a command of some 150 billion korons, without calling for tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to the threat of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop it, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, said Jančura today at Radiojörnnal.
Vaccination against pneumonia will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse the old habits of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals end up.
The pharmaceutical institution has already defined the maximum prices for vaccines that will pay sickness insurance.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumonia.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If vaccination has begun in the last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will be paid for themselves.
The first vaccine dose should be administered between 3rd and 5th months of the child.
In the last year, a quarter of families have voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumonia.
While parents paid 1600 crowns, they wanted more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
Specialists believe that health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 rabbits per year on vaccine doses.
However, they are saving on medical care that non-vaccinated children would need.
To date, the State has spent about 500,000 coroners per year for all vaccinations of children.
Refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
The pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the average ear but also serious infections such as manganese inflammation and blood clotting.
According to hospital surveys, there were only 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
As from January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumonia.
At an international conference at which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied that we had an optional vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have at least this tax.
I think it's a direction that you need to follow now, Kalovský said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to modify the vaccination process against pneumonia.
We do not look at him at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The optional vaccination of his or her inadequacies, says the doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Pediatric Society, recognizes that a vaccination based on volunteerism is a failure.
However, if all children were vaccinated, a decrease in the renewal of vaccinations could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," said Cabrnochová.
Experts estimate that in the next year more than 80 percent of new parents will be vaccinated.
The vaccination against pneumococcals also marks a break in the fact that it is the first vaccination of children financed by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free funds for prevention, thus saving for future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is related to the concerns of practitioners, who are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them as well as other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some MEPs feared that this would allow insurance to "decreas the sums of sickness insurance".
In this way doctors will have to buy products and expect insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, paediatrics will have to invest nearly 40,000 rabbits per month in vaccines, which is an important sum.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de Musée"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustration, was accused of trying to steal the tables for a value of $20 million (GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interviewed while carrying 90 tablets in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to it, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the entrance of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of personnel such as Conan le Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reporting to the Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer who said that young Mr. Frazetta might have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Frazetta Jr. said that his father had been authorized to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables into a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior has no such authorization, the agency said.
The Labour Office advocates an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers have defended the increase in the tax and expenditure reductions announced in the pre-budget report, despite the criticisms of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "was missing" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by reporting his decisions until the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the fumes by attacking the low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, there is an increase of 0.5 per cent in social security and a flat rate of 1 per cent on public salaries since 2011.
The anger of social security
The unions protested that the low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible for, and kept in mind that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social security - which will allow about 3 billion GBP per year - has put the world in a state of anger because it considers it to be a tax on employment while the goal should be a slowdown in the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCING OF THE REPORT OF THE PRE-Budget
Social security will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will be reduced by 4.75% expected this year.
New 50% rate on bank bonuses
The increase in tax on company benefits for small companies has been abandoned
Rebates of electric cars and windmills
Retirement increase of 2.5%
According to Tresor's estimates, a person who wins $30,000 will lose $90 per year and a person who will earn $40,000 per year, while a person who wins $10,000 per year will earn $110 per year more.
Ministers stated that their objective of reducing the deficit by 2013 was "hard decisions", but stressed that 60 per cent of additional taxes would be charged to the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, called for a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water flow in the ocean" relative to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide by two deficits, which will be absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was trustworthy and that the growth of the economy would grow again at the end of the year.
However, the Labour forecast on economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be met - was doubted after the Chancellor had to review its first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5% in April - while the empire would be 3 billion GDP above the expected estimate.
"No chance"
The Conservatives that will launch this afternoon a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labour, said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, adding, "synically" to difficult choices until after the elections - which should be held in June 2010.
"They presented no significance to what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Secretary-General of the Fantastic Cabinet Treasurer. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Bureau insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to the Tory proposals that would result in a faster and more important reduction in deficits.
However, the Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure would be used to support the expenditure of the next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "constructed on wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said that the announcements calendar - such as the increase in inflation for some of the benefits of invalidity in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, with the money just recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Office insists that additional assistance is provided when people are most in need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Faux budget"
Although ministers had not published the details of expenditure beyond 2011, economists claimed that it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to feel felt by mid-term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Conduits Fiscales) stated that the figures of Chancellor involve, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is not actually reported," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accounts.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well accountable."
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested at a rally in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , announced the US Embassy in Pakistan, to the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether the same men had been reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the United States said he was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being a Pakistani settlement, one of Egypt's heritage and the other of Yemen's origin.
If these are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and what conditions they are under," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, the FBI spokesman, said that the agency had knowledge of arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really the students who have been missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington claimed that men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said that the house had already been monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, rejected any comment on arrests, reported the press agency Reuters, but said that the United States should "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan in order to try to undermine the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from their home by their families in Virginia of the north in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuse'
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as low as ever, according to Amnesty International's report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he had been threatened with violence.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms regarding its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the greatest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Twelve were convicted of prison sentences and the prosecutors claimed that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, corresponding to the BBC in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our competitor said.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International related the case of 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of "Traviling with Facebook's networks" and protesting the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate who lost the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that after the election protesters were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of violence, but they admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an old prisoner who said he had been imprisoned in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary would create a committee to investigate the problems of post-election and Government response, but she stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent other demonstrations.
Ski tracks built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboards in competition for species prices.
On top of Brandon Hill Park's track, a small tramplin was a 100m long track.
John Hickman, studying in the fourth year of medicine, said that the view of the top of the track was great but that it was rather scary.
It's a great view, with all the lights of the city sintilillating in contrarebas.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday evening, the snow will be abandoned in the spring.
They're always with us.
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a Lao State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French don't like the folklore" (2006), an elegant and well documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for some 15 years and the effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much larger and more ambitious frame.
He does not want to know only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in museums, schools and institutes that now provide what M. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a marriage (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical issues, he said, which are the daily lot, rather than political dramas that concern media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern Thai society.
They don't stop the debate until the end.
Conservatives do not believe in a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of a Sunni Purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today is a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the flexibility of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be obtained with the efforts of each camp.
It asks what point French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of laity) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been punished, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also made historical compromises with Latin republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "secretity of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
Watching the World’s Most High
The Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes the composition is based on an alarming speed, bringing with it a life that cannot survive any more.
Petroleum, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their seal.
In "On a small glass layer", Richard Ellis, writer and illustration, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
A cognizant of the history and complex fisheries policies in the whale, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by throwing the white bear.
The encounter of the Amiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-olds who had to fight only the point of his musquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
Young bears, captured while they were on their mother's side, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 hours at the same time.
Even today, the sizes of a zoo are usually a million of the surface required for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that spread in its space.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often refers to the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Motoski Indians use powerful rifles to chase their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of these two nations that the ice will remain for the longest time.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, an old editor in New Scientist's head, offers a clear and exciting summary of the science of the Arctic and a captivating view of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospherics nor oceanographers can directly relate the speed of change.
It's not necessary to try.
At the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 21st, the pioneer trips of Fridtjoff Nansen provided the first information on the source of the glacier.
The underseas of the Cold War then charted the changes in relief.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg probes are a great help, but the biggest work is done by decent men, campaigning in the cold.
Mr. Anderson is aware of the extraordinary and small world of the tax system of Arctic ice, formed by the salty surfaces printed by ice.
But from the hours mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, this may be our tour."
From Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited graves in Arlington
The first class of De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, made a seven-hour bus trip to deposit a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, in the Arlington National Cemetery Cimmer, this day was devoted to welcoming men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the wounded soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that's why I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to deposit candles on the Veterans graves in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the celebration and others decided to rent several hundred tombs in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morris and his wife, Karen, travel every year, stop in different cities on their way to organize memorials in honor of the soldiers and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 corrons on the tombs of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, on the Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of the 93 United Airlines flight to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a lost career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had been sacrificed.
It's a little gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family bed.
Emmittoufled in several hot coats, volunteers marched between the pools and the hills extended to the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old graves, since World War I and World War II, as well as Vietnam's war, because these are not as often visited as new graves have declared organizers.
The humor was optimum, while the children were playing and the couple were holding their hands, carrying the pins on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red paperboard on top.
Nearly there was a silence on Section 60, where most of the war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are infected.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to draw the section, but the shadow of the current wars covered the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends stood in cold air.
Some read aloud the names recorded in the stone while others looked forward to seeing the small black and white information cards, focused on the wet ground for those who had not yet finished the tomb.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, Ohio, and had been driving eight hours to get back to the grave of Marine Gunnery David Shane Spicer, dead in battle in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"For a long time after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has arrested an American resource provider who distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, and has declared the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The associate, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities, as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, tried to gain access to the arrest on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made publicly, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested in advance of being "dangerous".
All revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered as serious crimes.
Cuba has a larger blogging community, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and are followed and treated by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the brothers in Cuba and Obama administration, which continues a "very" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban Government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed in Cuba, although this is new consumer goods and wants in a country or the average salary of a staff member is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for 15 minutes of conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare American prisoners in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press associate with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be authorized to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch group program, recently published a severe report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his ill brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often triggers a negative reaction to the United States, when both countries begin to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a deal to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities referred to an organization that was supposed to prepare a deal to send five Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would allow for an important network of recruiters of terrorists who are Internet-based for the search of young radicalized men.
The investigators claimed that they were missing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
When they arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them join the region of Pakistan's resort, Al-Qaida, and its terrorist training camps.
However, a representative of Pakistan's secret services reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince Al-Qaida commanders that these men had not participated in the CIA's plan to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far from the forbidden mountains in the north-east became a refuge of terrorism.
They were regarded as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed concern that the anonymity should be maintained due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to get access to the camps in al-Qaida when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- remaining in Pakistan and questioned by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in the determination of the people in whom they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. secret services have had the priority of educating men in the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing to enter those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are studied almost by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their promotional value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups should also be more careful in the last few years in the election of those who accept the fact that American secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is the one that is more and more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protestors in Copenhagen demand a "action" for the climate.
Tens of thousands of protestors have gone to the streets, here on Saturday, asking for a more important action on the climate of the negotiating parties working in the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 were estimated by the police.
This event took place relatively slowly, although a small number of masked activists have shed some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little had been done during the United Nations climate discussions, thousands of activists had left the city, dislodging cards in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it's enough."
Several celebrants joined protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to the country of his mother's birth, Peru, opened his eyes to the emerging problems that must be faced by the country due to the impact of the climate change that is already happening."
That is one of the reasons why I have decided to join the great march -- to pass the word and to appeal to the world's leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they were in possession of pockets.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they were in possession of pockets.
According to a passenger who asked for the anonymity to be preserved because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists carrying masks and black clothes have shed several explosives near Copenhagen's main channel, which is surrounded by several departments.
They threw them close to the furniture, he said, adding that they were all in front of the fuss, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Congress Palace, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the course, all along the afternoon.
But it seems that protesters have failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representing China for the climate.
When he was asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it was something I did not know.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "The event is important, I can't understand what's going on outside."
He noted that the course might seem negative or useful according to the outlook.
It shows the interest of the great public and the different sectors in the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal tension among the races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics brought good news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District remains far behind the head institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what comes from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Education Progress) is the persistent difference between the results of Africans and whites on both local and national plans.
The average results of white children from grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their Afro-American classmates have only increased from three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, with only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view of a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in grade 4 (cm1), when the first NEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results of children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58 points.
The last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase in the instruction group director Michelle A. Rhee and the Maaire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate), had been promoted by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and generous, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I am not pleased with one or two points won, Kwame R. Brown (democratic appearance), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of test results is that secondary schools (colleges) in the city are desperately in need of attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't spend enough time and energy in our secondary schools (colleges).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
For example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, for the end-class students of the elementary and college cycle, who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school courses and who are quite late in relation to their friends.
Every day, the math program for the Kindergarten (mother) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they have been put in the District by the former responsible Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAP reported last week.
I think it is simply that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a level lower than that of the class, says Rhee.
Another view is that the results of NEPAD raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the system's overall results by providing the money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest areas of Washington.
This goal can also have political implications for this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, will be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark's schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reduce the gap of success was that of the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, which he considered to be a "start point" for further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long syllable.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, comes down and shines a moment of eyes in the eyes of white columns, faces of bristles and verdant purples.
Graciela's parents could only finish school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never put her feet on a university campus.
Also, while she and other class students from grade 8 (4th) studied Gettysburg where school costs are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new impressed student than a enthusiasmist.
Super This is where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said she smiled, when she was shown the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovering journey and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to college:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely addressed to a large number of American children born to Spanish immigrant parents who have left school where they have become a parent at an early age, they are also hundreds of thousands of people to receive university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the "second generation" of five students at the university -- a remarkable success if it is considered that both their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing the school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they are opening the way for the following generations who will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study combatants claim that they have a natural affinity with school and a need for success.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- particularly if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate the system, no intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think of providing a network of support to these children, from mother to child.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared for you), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize the preparation programs at the university that begin when students of low-income families are in high school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Petroleum of Iraq receives agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two Saturdays.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are on the move to play a major role in the return of the oil industry in Iraq, which has been disabled for decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are divided into only two of the 10 fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second round that started Friday.
The only one who had put a ring was lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the fields set up in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American societies, Asian and European companies opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, a website on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, corroded by massive co-ordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability, as American military forces withdrew from the American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and which were more likely to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have had strong ties with the Ministry of Petroleum and have provided him with their technical advice, are the empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has more concern over contracts than other companies and is divided with important participants in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is about to become a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies have made bids that were then compared to the price per barrel that the Department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American mission, which had struck across the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of the Al-Qaida operations this week, declared to be Friday by the US anti-oppressive authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack on one of the terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a couple of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Palestinian authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchic tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, declared a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the Authority stated that suspected local militias were placed in a position and quickly confirmed what remained of the "completely decomposed bodies".
It was totally impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American anti-terrorist representatives gave no specific evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al-Qaida ' s military organizers leading terrorist operations in the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize complexes around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to preserve anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the aircraft in the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for potential terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority said that Somalia had made rapid progress in the al-Qaidas and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the great American public, but this has not reduced the threat it poses for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second important person of al-Qaida or the second leader of Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a group of soldiers in the tribal center, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, approximately six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have advanced to reduce their vulnerability while also imputing suspected informants, says the site.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his position in March, at the end of a mortuary mandate in support of allegations of corruption extended during the United Nations presidential elections.
The Eide Department intervenes when Obama decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase, but expressed concern about the United States calendar for a withdrawal of troops which would start in 18 months and which would require other NATO Governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to Afghanistan and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international staff to assist political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not give up, but that he would simply respect the commitment he had made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was an empty two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives state that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been mentioned; it is a citizen of Italy who has recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who has previously conducted United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former associate, Peter W. Galbraith, accused of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and demonstrating evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's allegations -- which had been appreciated -- "were detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism on the international observation of elections".
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the support of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he had been assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his power in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations procurement regulations had the opportunity to provide new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since then, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran has to face additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert. Gates, said on Friday that the great powers of the world would soon impose "an important additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in nuclear ambition talks.
Gates, speaking in front of a party of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has demoralized the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a decline.
One of the things that bother me most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's certainly the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considered a set of sanctions that would affect Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians in the street.
He stated that a "group of motivations and punishments" could be necessary to convince the Iranian Government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "the people would suffer enormously" of these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probably" consequences if it does not complete its nuclear programme in accordance with the United Nations Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it intends to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In his speech in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his rich uranium storage, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement to develop confidence on both sides and to make time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have been away from the attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
I believe that Iran's rejection of some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to agree on what they had not considered, in the light of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as a limited date for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what State Secretary Hilary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made yesterday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations declared what it called "unfounded allegations" of certain members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talking with the United States and five other major world powers, "to achieve a long-term satisfactory solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday morning, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for Kurdish's rich oil region to meet the Teams in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in American plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115 000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to ease the concern of Kurdes about the suspension. The American authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We won't leave you."
In ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Wejiia and her husband were surrounded by propaganda show, saying, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby, it's a more grave".
They have learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed this condition and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
He said 31-year-old Wang, Director of Human Resources, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, two generations of single children are known for their good games and games, including "small empires", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 years and will be more exploding, will be 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in coastal rich cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and more represented nearly 22 percent of the population of the residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Committee of the Municipal Population of Shanghai and Family Planning) stated that fertility couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the elderly and prevent a shortage of work in the future".
Shanghai is on the point of becoming "as old as - but not as rich, but as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
A progressive detachment
As part of the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of the only child is now the most controversial obligation imposed by the Communist Government.
Couples who go through this policy are at risk of being able to pay the tax exemptions - up to three times their annual income - and discrimination on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities gave the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women of a second child to rape.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - girls who are abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population gradually adopted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they made more exceptions to the rule -- including for the inhabitants of cities, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they have adopted many of their tough slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, stated that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In a short time, posts urging families not to have only one child were replaced by detailed copies of regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city's government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their home and to hide their prospects under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the response was negative.
Tenth Response
Although officials in a rural town of Shanghai's bathroom said they saw an increase in requests for couples who wanted a second child after the campaign was launched, the most urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000, for example, has always received only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still projected to be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the commune of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to feed their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would like to have two children and that they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they said that the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners considered, in the light of the fact that the policy of the only child is a problem of rights, Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months of the first child of the couple.
True, we want the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples mention psychological reasons to explain their austereness.
Wang, responsible for human resources, said that she wanted only one child because she was the same. "We were the center of the family and the habit that everybody cares about us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it most deeply.
For couples working at two, of the middle class, which are reducing the rate of birth, he says, self-employed must be successful.
People in their 20s or 30s have grown up seeing their parents fight in the first days of capitalist China and do not want to have this style of life themselves, he says.
Even one child asks a lot of time for his parents, he says.
A mother must leave her social life for at least two years.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "If your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best motherhood."
Most of her friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The conference on climate, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized occupations and mutual crimes -- has come under the fires of the Friday Framework, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with most industrialized nations, in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final policy agreement to regulate greenhouse gas has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it has clarified the way to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the ongoing negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Written by a United Nations special working group, the text does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to support climate recovery, in the current and long term.
It offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited six pages of the document, examined a text of 180 pages to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on the United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also launched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal changes have occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the representative of the United States for climate negotiations, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gas by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration becomes harder to China than Bush's administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister, He Yafei, said that the main US negotiator, either "good sense", or "extremely irresponsible" to say earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world power in play, deficits occur both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet with China and the United States, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, stated that it was not surprising that the main forces were fighting to know who should rise the cost of greenhouse gas reduction, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony has been developed, Ulate said, who is also the Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries were more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, said they would continue to pressure a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants said that negotiations would lead to a political agreement at least.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which together 43 members, prepared a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the whole political process", in part because they are now united and ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the problems before the Heads of Government reached an agreement.
High-level officials, such as Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and Deputy Minister of the Chinese Environment, have come from their plane and have been scheduled for the Bella Center to attend meetings in private and information conferences in order to be able to make claims that will be examined during the following week.
The real picture of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palace of Congress each day -- guitar actors present night shows moving from their respective countries, they are engaged, and proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than by e-mails -- are a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all major ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court of the grand, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation International policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 5:13 p.m., Monday morning, a roundabout will spend the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Great Britain.
The country's first high-speed bathing train will reach 225 km/h, while it will take Ashford, in Kent, London, St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be accompanied by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin-out-backing train.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate a rapid and reliable international network of trains and relieving the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and the Scotland in London.
The lost small trolleys will become flowering bathrooms, business travel will be much longer and the passage of the plane and train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road traffic.
In theory, the three main political parties joined the project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new irony network, the inevitable planning battle and environmental threats are likely to break the lines at great British speed.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to carry out a feasibility report for the government will submit its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London link line to the West Midlands will be drawn up in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be disputed.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final interior.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond to the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go up to West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Peninsulas in Manchester and Scotland and another heading north, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross the Ecosse.
"It seems to be the best performance option," said a railway professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced by 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's travel.
The proposals will allow you to travel 400km/h, making the fastest British network in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow 400m long trains and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is provided that an existing station will be expanded to receive the network at high speed.
Railway industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not the project must be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the machine starts, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to roll out of high-speed lines on the existing railways in north Birmingham, preserving travel periods between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage of aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers repay the loan of 75,000 GBP for Tory's Orangeration
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid to the taxpayer of thousands of books per year to pay the cost of an orange that he built in his home of his assignment.
The party's representative, David Cameron, who was retraced to complain that the members of the parliament were "stentened", increased his 75,000 GBP loan to build a branch extension to his second home, Rutland.
It had been authorised to pay additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the contributor.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at that time and have not been questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is monitoring the expenditure of members. On the last night, Mr. Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The kitchen, a living room and a dining room include a kitchen, a dining room, but the office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in improvisation during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Communities with regard to its pre-financing provisions.
The Committee has denounced any charge of non-compliance with the rules in the last month following an investigation of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the 271,406 GBP empire of his property in London at the home of his subscription that he purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed some 1,400 GBP per month of interest to March of the last year.
In April, its demand increased by more than €1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard rate of interest variable RBS was 7,94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, with no movement since then.
The latest publication of the Commonwealth authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request $1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as head of the fantasy cabinet in September, after a cover-up journalist filmed him saying that Parliament members were supposed to survive "over budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on the budget" and you're treated as "from the m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more sacredly, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as a oil negotiator, began to have to explain his expenses, in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the cost office that this could be considered excessive.
An activist crossed a £ hole in Mr. Duncan's pool to protest after it was discovered that he had requested $4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the empire, last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, both approved by the Office of Costs and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with the development or use of rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be cleaner or simpler."
Faithful, all of you come to see the calendar of the Bridgeton Avenue.
The Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Avenue calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to rent their cabin for each day of December, using Christmas songs as the theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 1730 to 1830, every day, with beds and hot wine served free of charge.
Noel's songs selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janett Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old foreign apartment? I think the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the calendar of the Avent of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated Saturday to claim an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming through the world and Copenhagen, where the police have been conducting hundreds of interventions.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, according to the organizers, have fallen into the cold in the Danish capital, outside the United Nations Climate Conference, to enter into force on Friday, January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has contributed to a "political price" of a very high deficit in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the strike, when a group of 300 demonstrators, completely dressed in black, broke down the windows in pieces of paves and hammers, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emeded police are immediately out of the house.
In total, the police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of the Blacks Blocks, these ultraviolet groups that were described in the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has announced the conditions in which hundreds of activists have been interviewed "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them were "always held in the street on Saturday evening "meanted and held in position in spite of extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the correction, rather a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, a negotiating site.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to paint it.
A scene was designed to welcome the scheduled speakers, before watching the candles with the participation of the former South African archival of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come in and out of large cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most in the impermeable blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen on the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "Blue Seas" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for restoration of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier of the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, loved the blessed Angel Kidjo.
There are rivers flowing in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we had never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of internationalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "liar climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no conflict between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is opening up many particularly vulnerable islands to rehabilitation, has given the cut in the delivery of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, were down in the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundred people, mostly students, fell in red, treeing bananas with solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, as well as in Canada, several hundred gatherings of demonstrators have also been held to demand energy action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network have collected hundreds of people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few tens of people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist elected his president, Georgia declares a "farce"
Abkhazia has elected her president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi declares a "farce".
Some 131,000 persons were invited to participate in this first round after the Russian-Georgia war of August 2008 for the control of the South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The voting offices closed at 1700 GMT.
The participation rate was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure, according to members of the Abkhaze Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday to Sunday night.
The five candidates, including the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, have categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the detention of the Kurutin.
These elections are a step forward.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michel Saakachvili, "records that Abkhazia should fall under the full occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, Nicaragua and Venezuela alone recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which has caused thousands of deaths, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new age as independent state, declared to the Svetlana Kvartchia AFP, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who came to the polling office in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential region in the southwestern region, along the Black Sea.
A large panel showing Mr. Bagapch on the side of the President and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials who have come to monitor the discharge.
We, the people of Abkhaze, have said during a small ceremony, despite the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, responded to a vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the survey by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises agreements with Moscow last year, as the former vice president, Raoul Khadjimba, and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, have been monitoring the agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one in Russia controlling the fire routes of Abkhazes for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither current power nor opposition.
A 50% majority more than one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second tour must be organised in two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went to the world on Saturday to ask for an ambitious agreement and binding on the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one hand, interviewed nearly 700 people in the event of a devastating event.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, have fallen into the cold on the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries by 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Part of Parliament, the correction, globally good child, has taken the lead in the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre without looking for a paint.
A scene was designed to welcome the scheduled speakers, before watching the candles with the participation of the former South African archival of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the strike, a group of several hundred protestors, completely dressed in black, bristles and martocks, broke down the wines, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emeded police quickly raided them and intervened without housing, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "the Blacks Blocks", these ultraviolet groups that were particularly illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the parking lot by a fire and four cars burned near a squad during accidents that led to the interpolation of about a dozen people, according to the police.
We've seen the extremist groups, the police portal, Henrik Jacobsen, has been banned while the helicopters of the order's forces have returned to heaven.
The majority of the protesters, who came in the streets and trained the great cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were European origins.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most in the impermeable blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen on the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "Blue Seas" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for restoration of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier of the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.

The French MEP José Bové, a figure of internationalism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no conflict between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organisation has mobilized several individuals, including Danishman Helena Christensen, former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who should be addressed to the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is opening up many particularly vulnerable islands to rehabilitation, has given the cut in the delivery of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, were down in the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundred people, mostly students, showed red clothes and treed bananas with solar energy in front of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a number of hundreds of protesters have also gathered to demand action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network have collected hundreds of people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few tens of people gathered in Geneva.
The successful history of the reform of the general lycee, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the reform of the general school, despite the removal of their compulsory teaching in scientific terminals.
The first students will now have all four weekly hours and the same programme for a shared common culture, said Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "he has to get out of hypocrisy" because, he says, "the S career is no longer a scientific career" but "in large, it concentrates on the best students."
The EU and L series cannot continue to be sub-filters of the S, and it continues: "I have not heard much history and intellectuals no longer escape from the absence of the history of the in-terminal geography in technological lycs".
Sadie, a survey by Ifop in Humanity revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69 per cent) failed the government project to eliminate the mandatory teaching of history in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some right elections.
The Minister added, however, that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unionists) called for a Tuesday mobility day to protest against the project, which sacrifices according to the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will have an admission test at the beginning of the year that will bring them to their discipline, and at the end of the year an admission test that will enable them to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow stage stages during the year of M2 and will be the first year in front of the students as seasonal teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the competition, you will already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, it will continue.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "from here to 2012.
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince you about the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this was the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Normal High School of the Ulm Street Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert interventions, every fifteen minutes, filmed and opened to the public, found an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and give them a desire to know more, explained at the Edouard Hannezo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from the one given by the students to the children of the school base.
Twenty stakeholders are selected from among the experts of their discipline and are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with the help of graphics, to a hundred people.
This is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will believe that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific document".
The videos drawn from these conferences will be posted online on the school site from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bi-metric pace.
Payment delays: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Prison supervisor unions called on Friday for "general mobilisation" to require the payment of this year's end-of-year premiums and additional hours, whose payment was suspended in January for budgetary reasons.
FO- prison (2the supervisor union) requested staff who would not be able to demonstrate tomorrow in front of the prison facilities and to "block them" to "declare the flight of their duties".
The CGT prison (3rd trade union) calls on them "to meet in general assemblies in various prisons for strong mobilisation", judging the non-payment in December of "additional hours, nights, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first surveillance union, the federal autonomous prison union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them have been budgeted, but they have ensured that reliquidants will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent an e-mail to the supervisor unions, ensuring that this payment would be made the next month.
I do not ignore the efforts of staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, wrote the Minister of Justice in this e-mail.
I asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation does not arise from a poor assessment of the number of additional hours in the future, said Ms. Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December pay will be fair, except for senior management staff who benefit from famous functions and targets, has disappointed Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have good two".
It is a scandal, the interregional FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not work on their Sundays and holidays unless those of October are not regulated in December, idem for additional hours, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
When we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our effectiveness, it is more sad to be caught in staff's dens, I consider Bordeaux's CGT prison.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad than others.
However, the account is not available in any way, the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama said to offer "more expensive tricks" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas in the White House, entrusted the "paper" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: "I give more than the ones I receive."
As part of a special issue that will be broadcast on the ABC channel on Monday evening, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little partner at four feet of the family will be part of the party.
Father Noël also loved Bo, thus said Michelle Obama, explaining that the dog would have a "surely" gift, according to the emissions released in advance.
And Michelle Obama was wrong about her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts he received: "I certainly didn't offer you nice gifts last year," she thanked the president.
Absolutely, it has been forced to give up before repetitiously repugnant by showing the true pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who has offered it to you?".
During this one hour's emission, in the detracted atmosphere, with the famous animator who has been a loyal support to Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife have also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a train at ten speeds, but also a basketball ball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him to Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
That's not much later in my life that I realized it was him who had given me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house, so I tied up all the furniture against the wall rather than arrange them around the road, but I loved this little house of people, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL claims it's artificial
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles due to important "leasions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed as an artificial to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "delays resulting from the operation" of the distal hernia in Paris on November 26, he indicated to Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, wishes to reassure you that the situation was "controlled", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated at 48 hours later.
According to RTL, partner of the last tournament of the singer, Johnny Hallyday, however, would have been thrown into an artificial coma to avoid "pangs and complications".
This is not just 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when it opens an eye, add RTL.
Questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been put after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Parc Monceau for this delicate hernie.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, has been practiced by the neurosurgery Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available last night to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, for a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, liked to play on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad step", but he made sure he didn't "no worry" about the rocker, which is "a fighter".
He just called me before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a connery because it took twelve hours to fly after such an operation, that's not likely, told Eddie Mitchell.
Wednesday evening, the singer Jean-Claude Camus wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "was responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "enduated".
Mr. Camus also said he had been interested in Laeticia, the husband of the singer, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his jacket.
Two months later, in general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had discovered that he had been operated with a "small lung cancer" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer relived his long "Tour 66", presented as his adhesion tour.
But since then, every health problem has been largely commented on. Fans and journalists have noted the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, her circulation had even to slow down a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small bassin: Bousquet's first on its fetish distance
Frances Frédérick Bousquet, a large-scale medalist in the 2009 World Basin, has issued an international title on a distance that he particularly enjoys, the 50 m free nag, in the Euro-2009 small bass in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, where combinations are allowed for the last time, saw only three records of the world Batus while waiting for a break.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 nages and the other two by Russia in raisins 4x50 m 4 nages.
A regret for Bousquet, who was proud of the 50 m free world record, which holds the brand in large bassine (20.94).
On one of the two queens of the birth, 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten nagers usually took the turn against eight, one first at the international level.
Bousquet developed the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had anticipated.
We can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the world record was at my door, I'd try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the nagers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the beginning of the 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations end their era in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not been used this time at the German Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in large bass in Rome, records of the world in key.
The young gendarmerie failed to lower the mark on 400 m free nag (3:32.77) but was still imposed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danois Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I don't think I'm in the middle of this race.
I knew I couldn't fight a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and carry out my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.: a sarcophagus panel belonging to the Adjugated Zola $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to French writer Emile Zola was delivered on Thursday $1.5 million, just above his estimate, announced the Sotheby's art market.
This panel before two meters long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and baccantes, is a rare part, there is only four or five in the world," explained to AFP Mardi Florent Heintz, vice-president of the works of the art of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold in one hundred pieces.
The sale is still ongoing, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most desired until now, a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told the AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared to the French actress Cecile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his Parisian special hotel, and to Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France, and briefly President of the Council before the entry into power of the Petain Marréchal.
It's been a dream zone for 50 years.
Looking at the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola success" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquaart".
Zelaya from Honduras's departure attempt to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the dead president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who refused a rescue from the Portuguese government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, it seems to indicate that the possibilities for the transfer are not met, said Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs Patricia Espinosa.
When Wednesday arrived in Salvador to welcome Mr. Zelaya, the Government of Mexico was assigned to its original location, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Puschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "demission" and ask for political asylum abroad to give him a way out of conduct.
The president, however, refused, because he wanted to return to Mexico as the Head of State for the period in which he was invited.
The Putschist government "knowed a new mistake by wanting me to give up my job (...), they wanted me to give up," said Thursday to Global Radio, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that lasts for five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added a few agreements by the dead president, who has fled to Brazil's Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's ambassador presented us with a request for asylum, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum applications, the Minister of the Interior of the Portuguese Government, Oscar Raul Matute, told the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum in any country. Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview at the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras should be made as President of the people of Honduras, he stressed.
Mr. Zelaya's departure rummers had mobilized the dead president's party, who had come to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the military had strengthened their seat.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Portuguese government.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this Government in view of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who was close to Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been interviewed on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare his re-election against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
Exhibited in Costa Rica, he returned surprisely on 21 September and fled to Brazil's embassy.
If he succeeds, he will be arrested to answer the crime of "high treason" in which he accuses justice, according to the Portuguese government.
Pitchist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the contested poll recognized by the United States but was challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street mount, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Forum ended on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance testify to the resume of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and Nasdaq, technologically dominant, 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Large Standard & Poor's 500 Index was allocated 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news coming from different economic backgrounds, Judge Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotic, she waited, believing that the market would focus on "the full half wine".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows that the activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, at $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expected to reverse an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the increase in the volume of trade, especially for exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the United States' major trading partners, comments Christopher Cornell, of the Economic.com research firm.
On the other hand, the new registrations in unemployment in the United States have increased against any expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But in the last four weeks, the average of the number of new employment applicants "has fallen to the lowest of one year", said Scott Marcowiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Tresor's good performance increased to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday evening and from 30-year-olds to 4,492% against 4,408% on guard.
Cuba: hundreds of members of power consist of "white ladies"
Several hundreds of Cuban forces have made a meal of political prisoners' husbands gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents have been interviewed.
A quarter of "white ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were set up in full street by the government of Raul Castro while they went to the capital centre to claim the release of political prisoners, found a journalist from the AFP.
Under the Yankees!, "mercenians!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" were scandalating, the rising bridge, the parties of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil servants who came to "insurance their protection".
The guard, a similar demonstration was conducted against the "white ladies" in La Habane, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanai district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also eager to demonstrate Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, inter-polated by civil police, an AFP journalist.
Police have forced dissidents in civilian vehicles, which have been made up of government parties, according to the journalist.
Interpolation of dissidents in similar circumstances usually lasts only a few hours.
Receipts of the Sakharov Prize 2005 of the European Parliament, the White Ladys had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200, according to the residence, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain under the walls.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercinians" or "agents" to be the money of their declared enemy, the United States.
It was racist, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of pro-government fighters against the "revolving counter-revolutionary".
Cuba, headed by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by the European or American NGOs of breaking up rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forcee kills an octogene on the coast and makes 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed army of two soldiers killed an octogene and injured five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Gaarenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of riot, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, a 28-year-old rapist would have been attacked by two prisoners and for uncertain reasons, an octogenic in or before a pharmaceutical of 85 Jean-Jaurès, had been trained by police and witnesses.
He was seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union officer Alliance, died in the hospital of his injuries.
In or before the same medicine, he was then taken to a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged thirty, was confused and injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogene was injured.
The days of the other injured are in danger, and vital organs are apparently affected by police sources.
The pregnant woman was then ill and would have been hospitalized "in shock condition", according to a police source.
The armed man, who looked like under the alcohol or drugs company, according to a police source, would then be thrown into the street, always bullevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have hurt two passengers, apparently at the Hasard: a 30-year-old and a quarter-year-old, the last robbery.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two boots that he wore behind his back, explained on-the-spot a leader of the Alliance union in the Highs-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Several past, including young people, have tried to master the force, according to the AFP's evidence.
I've seen a kind of thirty-year-old with a green dress.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, reported Alberto, a servant of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, and a city cop who broke the poignet added it.
Every day Jean-Jourès boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, their commanders, tried to interfere with the armed man and were injured by poking, according to police sources.
The facts were produced in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main artries, where there are many shops.
Some of the survivors came to tell me there was someone hurt out there.
I came out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important crying in Abdominal, told AFP Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of a thirty-year-old was arrived, injured in the neck.
These are the functions of the national police that arrested the person who had been convicted of identity papers.
The Nanterre Park has been investigated by the Department of Justice Police of the Highs-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The force was hospitalized last night.
He had not yet been heard in the context of his vision.
A police source did not exclude him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to master him at Clichy's police station where he was expelled.
He was "in an emergency state" as "all the forces of this species whose forces fail under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again complains about the withdrawal of prosecutions
The French-Polish film lawyer Roman Polanski once again complained on Thursday in Los Angeles, West California, U.S.A., about the withdrawal of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist" realiser, complained before three judges of the second district court of California of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I claim the absence of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the two."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has been dead since -- would have discussed, before giving his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious fault of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, researched and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared late in September to have "miss" the author of the documentary.
In the case where the court refused to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel claimed that he had a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his argumentary.
The charge was repeated on his part by the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski did not present himself before the court.
The film, 76 years old, had disappeared from the United States in 1978, before its sentence was pronounced, for "unlawful sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has never given up his feet to the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor of the Los Angeles county, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself to the hearing".
In this case, do you want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, which is possible to fire?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the film "demands a favor to the court, while ignoring its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were other alternatives to escape.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the withdrawal of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being caught up in each rebuff of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was right.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months later, he was assigned to reside in his chalet in Gstad, waiting for any extradition.
Wall Street is out of control, frozen by the rise of the dollar
The New York Forum ended without direction on Friday, in a successful market between the best indicators for the United States and the dollar increase: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while Nasdaq, technologically dominant, has left 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Large Standard & Poor's 500 Index has grown from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, raised Mace Blacksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in close borders, the volume of exchange has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "helped to improve market opinion on the stability of economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month and much more than planned.
The US consumer confidence was further refined in December, at 73.4 versus 67.4 last month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indicators have been shaken by a new progress in the dollar, not least for two months in front of the euro, which "may lead down sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost the land.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Tresor's good performance increased to 3,540% against 3,482% Wednesday evening, and from 30-year-olds to 4,497% against 4,492% of the guard.
Miss World's election once again in South Africa
After a month of periple across South Africa, 112 candidates from Miss World are ready to launch Saturday's last right line to realize their dream: be chosen by the world's most beautiful woman in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this great show of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already broken their ticket for the semi-final.
Ms. Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta du Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sports or even Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real tournament.
Visiting such beautiful towns as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cap was extraordinary.
I've seen so many things and I've lived so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone complains.
This competition, which took place for the ninth time in South Africa, has been re-transmitted directly since Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 1700 (1500 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give up my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, points out Ms. Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, his second residence in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with candidates and the rediscovered "of lands to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Mission now focuses on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presented to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream of being crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it's nothing but appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, launch Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will point to this 59th edition.
The candidates will appear in traditional costumes and certainly in bathroom mail.
The show will be encouraged by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a member of Ms. Monde Steve Douglas's committee.
South Africa has shown that it was able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Ms. World's President Julia Morley.
Like last year, the candidates have made a safari, visited Soweto's famous town, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who closed their hand.
Not running for a Head of State, notes Ms. Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will no doubt be taken to Cape Town (south-west) for the World Cup of football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've had a lot of people I never thought I could approach.
I'll no doubt come back for the 2010 World, I'm excited to miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", according to his son David.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to return to his father's hospital bed for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday at his plane exit that brought him from Paris shortly after 1300 locals (2100 GMT).
The son of the singer, the air stopped, made sure that he would "be very quick" at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for a follow-up infection during the operation of a detached hernie on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was "placed artificially this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, in order to prevent him from suffering and administering his treatment", said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed as an artificial by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a follow-up infection during the operation of a distal hernia on November 26th in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday because of important injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, went to the French college in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photograph of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salpètriere hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would return Monday to Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has violently caused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who performed the singer on November 26th at the International Clinic of the Monteau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were gone, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thought Johnny Hallyday was "too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this on-line doctor who made sure that there was no problem with this trip and it surprised me, since I had myself two dyslexic years, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "partless, empty", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he worked at the time.
In 2007, the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg also operated to absorb a hematom following brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor of the sulphorous reputation, convicted of several prosecutions by justice, in medically responsible files, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
But Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scars" continued "regularly" before the Order Council, which is " far from recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "perfectly performed" and post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not need the seat of a dragon," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be among parents.
Obviously, a resume of the tournament on 8 January (in Amiens, dllr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association increases the tone and sums the New Centre to no longer use its bike
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem de François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the ex-Gescardin's seal, while not using it on any support, under judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF signal, considering that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after he put his hand on the left.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy before the National Council of the CN.
In support of his approach, he received support from MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP in the NC) who claimed the property of the UDF brand to be the first to deposit it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF's office, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not want to leave their home, is left alone to send a stay to the Minister and the Member, the amount of them not to use the bike and transfer the property of the brand, under judicial prosecution.
You have multiplied, these last days, statements indicating that you are willing to propose your political movement to +retain+ the UDF signal, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Artuis of the Central Alliance.
You have also found it good to follow on your military equipment and on the site's website's website, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the logo + the today's UDF+, also identifies the email signatures.
As you don't know, you have no right to use this cycle, explain the UDF's office that keeps the NC "soon the mention of the UDF name of any support and (song) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to its legitimate legal allies.
If you do not do so, the courts would be seized to comply with the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, preventing signatures.
In their e-mail, they state that UDF "is a political movement entirely from 1978" and remind Mr. Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, like others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French democracy).
They also recall that the latest UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he deposited the mark", he was not "more than a UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
It uses scandalously and fraudulently the lack of deposit of UDF acronym to do it for its account.
This indelictity is being turned into crime, they declare, before they are ironic on the NC's strategy: "We appear to be political, as in life, more worthy of making a name for ourselves than trying to get out of anonymity by wrongly taking a name that we have no right to".
Case Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
Nanterre's court decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the Billionaire's daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, has been accused of a state of obsessiveness by the octogenaire for the sponsoring of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime of a maximum three-year prison sentence and a fine of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will be a good trial in this case of a saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are still resting while bearing the roots of the empire of cosmetics The Oréal.
But the 15th correctional room also ordered that a medical expert at 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
The principal heritage and shareholders of the Oréal have always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Park during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report before 10 March 2010 stating, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt was able to be found in the state of weakness and for what periods.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him, and he told me that Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, came out of the audience.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It is a great new (...) The expert will show that he (Mr. Banier) managed this elderly lady to be protected, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter committed prosecutions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-all artist, who claims to have enjoyed her mother's weak years in order to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned to a large family debate on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer made three letters sent by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she hated the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 email, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
On the other hand, Nanterre Park once again felt that the complainant was not acceptable to act, much more than a guardian judge refused these last days to have the right to request a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to act in justice, she is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Christine Daubignney.
Finally, the Court decided that the trial would be carried out on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have come...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies for their employees reminds us of the position of consumers in favour of the marketing revolution: it is to join the "values" partners determined above, as it was sometimes, to impose on consumers the products that are considered by the device technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given rise to market convergence strategies in the place... although the authoritarian attempt to impose decommissioned products from customer preferences is regular!
Demobilization of employees can result in fatal demorrhage.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only part of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly the frameworks.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "needs all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospectus vision" ; it requires employees to make a commitment that copyright management revenues are totally contrary to.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be the focus of the business's concerns as well as the client.
The use of all relevant internal opinion surveys
The internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
First of all, because I've been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally happens, after all the damages, to do priority... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
From high engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. neurosciences and widely disseminated, in their opinion, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to conduct the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the frameworks, a recent Ipsos survey published in The Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a mechanical governance post, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors
On the contrary, the management revolution required for the proper functioning of modern enterprises implies the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating, in any reason or practice of governance, a fundamental condition: for employees, the commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize a part of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only studies from the Moti-functional Analysis have adopted this concept of employees' motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a standard dose that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and assign their human resources management to "the place".
They thus create an area conducive to the development of a coherent robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: " just war" is worth right-wing praise to Obama
The U.S. right welcomed the speech delivered in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservators, who had briefed Mr. Obama's award on 9 October, this time praised the presidential speech, at Sarah Palin's invitation, former vice-presidential candidate at the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, in USA Today, adding that she had also addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that came to be published.
The war is well understood in my opinion that Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
You have to stop these terrorists all over there, she loved it.
Mr. Obama, who managed the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was very good, and the former President of the Chamber of Representatives congratulated him, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the matter of presidential.
On the other hand, I found this historical speech, said Mr Gingrich, questioned at the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former election, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, was said to have seen "a left president" remind members of the Nobel Committee that "they would not be free and could not bring a price of peace if the appeal did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former poet George W. Bush convert chronicler to Washington Post, Mr. Obama spoke "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting themselves in "the citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans that "they live in a security hole that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rares to be not convinced, a faucet of Bush's age, former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, has qualified for the talk of "tear, ampoule and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the right hand of the President, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is covered in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, it has been preserved.
However, the centre-left press remained respectful at the position of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still considering that Nobel was previously awarded to Mr. Obama, qualified his "super-production" award even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression" was flammable on California's day.
Mr. Obama "declared what he had to say," loved the New York Times, judge "with both shadow and building".
Roaders: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
Following three Marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only parental organization to remain until the end, came to an agreement on Friday evening, ending with the word of complaint and the serious threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "satisfied" with this agreement, following a number of negotiations, which were hosted by Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same if three parental organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to be held at 11 a.m. in order for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 18 a.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "he was afraid that he would be disturbed by the end of the year", said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for a 4 per cent increase in salaries for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (International transport).
For low-sales, "the rate is 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big thing, but it's a very far part, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will order our soldiers that there are no blockades, no blockages from the emergency centres.
But we can still have some recalcators that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "hard to grant increases on the high payrolls in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of EUR 170 per month for the low wages and of EUR 100 to EUR 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect of employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFCTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the revaluation of 3 per cent travel costs, and the maintenance of the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in parental charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending Finance Act for 2009, voted on Thursday evening by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to apply for the first time to companies associated with the organization, and the second time, to all professions, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
She'll be "in the shortest time," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of parental organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR declared a "puppies market" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the teeth of the next revelation, he has disappointed Unostra.
For the other, the agreement is likely to "increase the fall of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this week-end, disgruntled syndicates of the RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, the largest urban transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the direction of the RATP left them on their hunger for their first request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important week of purchases before Christmas, there will be only between 10:00 and 2000 trains due to two trains on the central throne (between the Defence and the Nation) and four trains outside the central throne.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, are pleased that "RATP makes efforts to serve large stores".
The RER A through the west is the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP throne is short from Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about a train on two has circled at the time of the moment, and almost no frame in cross hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there was no argument about which, the French were organized.
So early in the morning, the St. Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much more frequent than usual, including the absence of college students and students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old Jack Nkwana explained that he had been up to "a 30-hour earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
The Saint-Lazare station did not know of satisfaction, said the SNCF, which had provided for an arrangement of agents and forces.
The A RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Sergey-Le-Hout arrived or shared from the Saint-Lazare station to meet the metros.
New general meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged by the unions, of a meeting with the direction of Friday after noon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career management, etc.
That's not what drivers want, which claims a first two, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even introduced its parentheses premium proposals, the CGT was indeterminate, stressing that the direction "was not set to solve a problem while on the road and the SNCF was done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", the RATP stated.
Which also told trade unions that the company "was moving from weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had rented an establishment committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested that the meeting should be "in an emergency."
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B Tuesday, after depositing a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions claim a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line to millions of passengers every day.
RER drivers, all in the second part of the course, are reaching EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums for the hours spent, Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has gone out of the pro-kurde party, a serious decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the resolution of the main pro-Kurde party of the country, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to be very complicated by the government's task, which has just held hands to the Kurdish community in order to try to end up to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a “study of activities that are detrimental to the independence of the State and its individual unit”, said the President of the Court of Hasim Kiliç, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to declare the resolution, said Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the members of the party, his President Ahmet Türk and Mr. Aysel Tugluk, are behind political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the rise of parliamentary immunity that had been granted by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscatation by the Treasury of the Party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (over 550).
His leaders had prevented before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdulrahman Yalchinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered to be a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political vine of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the Government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict is that the Government has just held hands to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights to try to withdraw the support of the Kurds to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a resolution could lead to a recession of tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan have been brought to an end with the police during the past few weeks.
From the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east most of Kurdes.
The order's forces pulled lacrymogenes and used water cannons, while demonstrators fired molotov cocktails or stones, with brakes.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Turk stated that the decision of the Court would "encourage despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurde, dllr) by prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also disappointed the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
This has not been resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpling of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Island.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK to be added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most lethal in recent months.
First snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
However, the official of the Road Deployment and Smuggling Service (FES) states that this is not to empathize citizens.
It's just that agents can test vehicle techniques and learn to master them well.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and ice.
The EFF is following a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that since he had to snow on the city of Frankfurt and that the temperatures are below zero, 20 main routes (named the A routes) from large sandy vehicles are covered.
This includes major traffic routes, major artries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes pumping access, common transport corridors, pedestrian areas and paint streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be sanded with a well-adhesive driver at 3 hours of maximum time.
That is why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. in the morning "to break the roads when the daily migration traffic begins".
There or it becomes more difficult, when the snow falls at 7:30 a.m.
This poses problems, we are told by the road degrading and smelting service "because no car driver is willing to let the car pass".
Then, if it does not go further, access routes and desert routes - such as the Salt-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and the lateral streets will come at last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this is always a matter of complaint.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian team is on its way to give priority to hazardous areas and crossings.
With regard to the cycle tracks, the EFF services cannot generally take care of them.
Mr. Brauburger stated that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the status of the bridges between 2200 and 4.30 p.m.
As the brakes form very rapidly on these surfaces, the bedroom vehicles intervene as long as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
It is also possible for the police to call on this special service whenever necessary.
The denosaurs' Berry
The Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede would measure about 2 meters long for 1,50 m high, its later members were powerful, its long neck was covered with sharp teeth and covered, its short arms were cut out by fungal flues and it had a long neck.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't have been exceptional.
However, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and its colleagues in Thursday Science magazine, Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal was alive 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made it part of the land of the supercontinent, and was located in the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Light Tawa of a new day is the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us about the parentheses, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt took over the caves in the company of other paleontologists, on the Gohst Ranch site in the north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Natural History Museum of Utah and a member of the team of caves tells them that they sometimes found a dozen ossetions in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these ossetia were belonging to a new species.
The leaflets have updated the remaining five species.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized him in the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some imperfect bone fragments.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of Bonn University does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but it is clear that it can confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all first dinosaurs.
Experts ask each other how long the sauriens have been divided into three major evolution groups: theropodes (carnivores) that include tyrannosaur and later velociraptor and which come from birds, sauropodes, long-term quadrupeds, and those that appear to them and Ornithian herbivars who form part of species such as triceratops and stagos.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first therapists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found indications that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in its ears at the level of the skull, as well as birds that are descendants of thetheropods.
These small air bubbles facilitate the breathing of birds in relation to mammals.
It seems that at the Tawa hall, the valves were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest therapists presenting small air bags in its os.
As the apparent line of sauropod immens also had air bags and a slight ossetration, it may be thought that their common past already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive wave of migration to North America.
As the most famous dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians were there.
As a result, the three large lines of evolution have been divided and separated from South America to the rest of the world, that is, the whole of the emerging lands that formed the supercontinent of the Pangue.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologist team has also discovered the remains of two other therapists who are not particularly present to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of Science Studies said there would have been at least three wave of migration to North America.
He's heard some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist at Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaur, who lived in the present Poland and belongs to a group belonging to dinosaurs.
This could be mistaken because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs have managed to become the dominant tetrapodes of the secondary age while they have a relatively rare collateral line from the retina branch remains a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and many other sauriens.
At the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassique.
Such success, however, is not everlasting.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction in which dinosaurs have experienced a lot of excitement while other reptils would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better adapted and could therefore eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourable metrore of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias, which had since grown in the shadow: it was the mammifers.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatures throughout the world.
There are teachers from Toronto University, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley University in California.
There are those who are in charge of the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin or Bréme.
The evacuation by the casino police of the University of J.W. Goethe de Frankfurt makes waves all over the planet.
278 teachers and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of the Westend Camp.
In a statement made in German and English, the police intervention claimed by the university's board of directors is inconsistencies.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the cave that walls and works of art had been barbulized by graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories argue that the degradations did not justify "a so violent intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Eviction is an “inappropriate violation” of freedom of research and education.
The fact that focusing exclusively on vandalism acts serves only to "delegitize and criminalize the protest" and tries to forget the reasons for the mobilisation.
The Board of Directors of the University thus concluded discussions that would still be necessary.
Course charges require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
Most of the employees did not take part in the degradation.
Legalization of protests
Young people from the Verdi trade union sector and the German Federation of Syndicats (DGB) are becoming students solid.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of Youth of the Verdi Syndicate.
With regard to the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she made and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she said to the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday at the current TV show.
We understand the sense of protests, but we do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU of the regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (the Link) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the premise of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche (Linke) party.
Instead of reflecting on students' arguments and claims, we evacuate them.
The part La Gauche has set out a motion to be submitted to the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The New Silicon City
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden by Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of research for the secret weapon, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are installed there.
Since September 2008, Zelenograd's representatives have established links with Riedberg, place of French sciences – with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Special Cooperation Protocol".
The signatories were the Vice-President of Moscow Juri Rosljak and chief Anatoly Smiv of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, head of the project section for Francfort.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of prominent Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Electronica companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Ville green") takes his name from the trees in the heart of which research centres are installed.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
We can't have enough room for the scope of the Stuttgart 21 project.
For his party this is nothing less than a "new heart of Europe".
If you want it. S21, it's better than building a railway station, than a colossal construction project that will crush the heart of Bade-Wurtemberg's capital, in an desperate chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the '80s.
The railways, with roads ending in the whole city, had the reputation of being the relics of the 19th century transport technology, which had an effect on the brake of modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to pass the back locomotics ahead.
Come, stop short, start – that's what you have to do.
That's why line racing should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a train pass station, which is on the midway around the trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The implementation of project S21 will indeed start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bring the train into the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavière, was exorbitant.
In fact, line coaches do not really have access and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with autorails and car-pilots at both ends.
However, the achievement of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched along the new route from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and Community policies have brought it.
The railway company is of the part because it is the contributor who makes the risk costs of the largest federal infrastructure project and not the public enterprise.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively justified.
There is a urban space that – if you believe in computer-generated planners charts – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is weak.
The passage station and the extension of the section are designed for the traffic of the people to whom it was assigned - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for high-market flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of traffic in goods as rail transport is much more relevant to the environment than by road.
But the new track, with its hints, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, which is much more serious, is directly related to other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be included in the Souabe project.
It's the official number.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connection and integration in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions in all six major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine Valley 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to support the champion here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a freezing Saturday.
The border of the Rhine Valley is in the process of becoming the world's most unusual gateway to international trade, and this is in the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the judgement made on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land mentioned the possibility to appeal to the Court of Justice of Hesse on the prohibition of air flights at night.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had been responsible for the legal review of the judgement made by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document covering more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had reasoned in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the night flight ban in the case or the construction project of the northern landing track of Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The permit to catch 17 planes between 23h and 5h in the morning, as the Government of the Land considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition is critical of this time and tries to pressure the representative of the Government so that he will be brought before the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The Head of the SPD Parliamentary Group Torsten Schäfer-Gombel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to prohibit flights at night. Otherwise, this will be considered a total failure to a given word.
It's very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the chief of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, giving a speech to the electoral slogan of the FDP "We have our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's claims that the Government of the Land is trying to authorize even night flights using "advocacy and robbery".
It takes time to carry out a precise legal examination.
Coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first fast-pressure".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of his group on the prohibition of night flights is entirely ironic.
The US banks pay for the aid granted
The large American banks, which are deeply affected by the crisis, break off their ties towards the State.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (more than EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television chain CNBC reported that Citigroup also expected to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to remove the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the benefits allocated to managers and the higher costs regulation.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors, which reported 19 billion dollars of cash to it.
The rest of the sum comes from bank cash that are well-filled through the sale of several branches in other sectors.
On Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Director-General of the Bank of America, expressed appreciation for the American contributors: the injection of capital helped significantly to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by withdrawing Merrill Lynch’s investment bank from the strongest financial distortion.
The Citigroup also intends to seek money on financial markets in order to free itself from the State's guardianship.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a 20 billion-dollar capital increase on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain citing the banking environment.
The Citigroup's speech portal did not want to comment on this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the public funds they had received.
Acceleration Selection
Finally, everything happened even faster than planned.
Two weeks after the removal of the current editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender was appointed by the German chain Administration Board of ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The Committee wished to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who led the Berlinese edition of the ZDF, was a great favour.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to precipitate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the wish not to impose any more pressure on the ZDF Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Governing Council.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed 9 votes to 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the contract to Nikolaus Brender for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were declared to be favouring the redundancy of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender's resignation was a food but predictable failure for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority of the Board of Directors, had already been allowed to hear a few weeks before the vote, did not want to re-enter Brender.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Hesse Land who had arranged a link with the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief, calling for the lower hearing rate of ZDF's information emissions under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, putting the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, there were 35 public law experts who were involved in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was anti-constitutional.
But that won't work.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied the sciences and politics, the teaching and the Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in Southwestfunk (Radio Body of Rhenanie-Palatinate) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German port Kuwait).
In 1983 he became the editor of the ZDF's daily journal (Today's journal).
Then it continued: from 1988 to 1990 it was the assistant editor-in-chief of the period; then, corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998, he was the head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bilateral information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then the head of the Berlinese edition.
After Brender's resignation, while he was just elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Verts announced that they would deposit a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Governing Council, Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the ZDF intergovernmental Treaty so that the proposed staff of the intent cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political personality of the ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender, had been working closely with the Board of Directors by criticising the Commission with enthusiasm in his decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalism, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as the Board of Directors could lift it without supporting the position of a political party.
In the arrhythmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberally on the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partly success for students: after a year of graduation, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Lands decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was made to provide that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lay down the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will be reimbursed to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of studies between universities and abroad.
The Landers are also committed to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for the Rachel and Master fairs.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulations from one country to another.
Less Reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in last June, the Ministers of Education of the Countries and the University Rectors have consistently expressed the expression "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single examination", read in a document of thirty pages on future conditions of access to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council, said that by reducing the burden of the exams, the delays should be stopped, which would significantly undermine the ability to study.
The "study" should increase in future the crucial criterion of the organization of studies.
Modules such as the background should be carefully examined to see if we cannot avoid this feeling of excitement that we sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberated fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and the margin of work necessary to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will apply to access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "credited" every 5 years, however, which means that in 2015 it is only that all cycles will be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils established by the Landers.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Countries to rely on agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the review regime was not too strict.
In some countries, universities and higher schools have already been heard with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhine-Palatinate has so far been the only country that has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize training programmes to strengthen educational orientation offices and the review offices and the service of international relations.
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the Government wished to deposit an amendment to the Law on higher education institutions with Parliament.
Thereafter, it will need to pass on only one review to close its studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, and it will be possible to ensure the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and the access to the Master needs to be simplified.
By the end of the next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the subject of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Association of Social Students stated that he would like the organization of education policy to be no longer in the future "closed doors" of Ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margaret Wintermantel: "Our students' experience is very useful" she said yesterday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Countries with which HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the union of education and science (GEW) decisions made in Bonn will not be far enough. He claims the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks the Länder to provide the Bachelor students today, that there will be enough space for studies in Master and good study conditions as well as possible.
The countries must therefore make more courses.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Education has not mentioned the possibility of granting access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "He arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he is thematic in the breebs of disturbing phrases, experiences of a dissident who has gained freedom in Germany but has lost his linguistic territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and then a director of the collection in a youth's publishing house before installing himself in Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received different literary prices; in 1993 he was a very popular poet at the University of Goethe de Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's House of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about him in recent non-literary circles during a convention in Munich, where the theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your security files".
Apparently destabilized and generous, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Roman fellow writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer who had collaborated as informant for the Security Police.
Söllner received the German price in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Rotary testing had begun in 1971.
I am, of course, that Söllner concludes, "so someone who does not have sufficient support for security intimating."
Werner Söllner's poet is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost at the same time with the respect of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary demolitions with the power mechanisms of the dictatorship, the literary scene is wide open and, in particular, the community of the German originals of Romania, by a case that clearly shows the ambitions and the fall of a political system based on police surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say according to current knowledge, not only costly but also vulnerable.
In his own Security file, IM Walter played a role, ensuring the literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
"He could have removed it from all the difficult situations at the time," says Marcel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the existence of an old dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not really so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Security had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper " Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It may be assumed that the victims would have made speculations and sometimes the real names of Sorin, Voicu, and Walter were later hidden.
In contrast to Germany, where the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the heritage of Security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been unhindered and frozen in the past years.
In 1999 a national council corresponding to the Birthler Institute was created to work on the Assimillation of Security Archives (CNSS) but the restoration of the files was rather overt.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security Council in Romania is still very great, it is confirmed by the interview of an old security officer of Temesvar, who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expressed itself three times in relation to the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end we asked her only once.
The infamilies of power thought they could express here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, inequitable issues are associated with Söllner as they often occur in a hidden context of guilt.
Why now? Who has been married? The weighted reaction of the audiences, like Söllner, lets hope that the follow-up to this chapter will be more defined by a dream of knowing that it is due to accusations and a sense of shame.
On the Genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the League Championships
The impression was that a representative arrived there, drawn to four spies coming from all the right of a Christmas season, where the sports producer had placed his goods when the new VFB Christian Gross trainer set up at least one quarter in a Class C Mercedes, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier's hand.
The man who drew attention to the cholera let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have taken his own flight – he had no alcohol and he was no longer happy.
He had a pleasant evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because it's now that it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we were going to start three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth end," that is, in connection with the champions, thanks to our 3:1 against the Urzicen Union of Romania, but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight to not return."
The "great work" is waiting for us tomorrow.
There, it is about repeating the results of the daily champions' league in Mainz.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have surfaced after the three expeditions of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drag to sort
The eighth final of the League Championships (match to 16/17. + 23/24 February/ match back 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be released on December 18th in Nyon.
Therefore, the joy of the entry in full function of the successor of Babel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the one who had had the chance, who had passed on to the destabilized workers in Stuttgart, an unfathomable motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I saw the players and I told them that they should focus on their atoms, I advised them to be more courageous, explaining the "blowing of souls" – Gross – the result of the success that seemed so happy that it no longer had any effect with the lord Babel.
He started some magic, avua Jens Lehmann - apartsan of Babbel - "in the foot when there's a new impulse, it sometimes happens things that we would never have believed".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break to hurt, advanced to the rank of the best player through his dynamics, tries to describe the "fenome" detected by a proverbial "cost wind" and the working method of the new boss: "It's someone who goes through action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But Babel evidently lacked it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head yet, keeping the manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart was particularly in need of tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are careful to evaluate the victory against a totally excessive and weak defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow four days before having a bad revelation in Leverkusen with the 0:4 object Khedira.
Horst Heldt, manager, reports that they had achieved one of the goals of the season, but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt's 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory for three months, is from the weekend events that a television interview of the goal guard Jens Lehmann was rebuffed just before the start of the match.
There are decisions others make and not Jens, who would oppose Heldt, in response to Lehmann's criticism.
He accused the leadership of low-style and said that he had decided to change trainer under pressure from puberty boys.
Lehmann had also been judged as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of release after the matches had been deleted.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a purely egoism" enfoça Heldt and announcing the consequences for the target guard.
They were no longer in danger of becoming friends with these two quadrennials.
In any event, they agreed for the rest of the group, that without the group's prior work by the coach replaced it would not have been possible for strong sports and combat representation.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in success” returned Heldt and Lehmann to the heart – and even the man to the plastic bag was acquired.
Championship your world weights owes
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger won without this verbal and gesture champion of the Vitali Klitschko world.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its world champion of heavy weight after the WBC Federation's version.
In the unity of the judges, it applies to the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko maintains its champion title of the world of heavy weights.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the point of unanimity against American judges Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
The World Championship of the WBO and WBC federations had already won twice before.
Unfortunately, KO has failed so much.
Klitschko, who comes out 39 times in 41 professional battles, has twice suffered from injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the arena of Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the battle, above its height of 2.02 meters, by its left.
Johnson, 11 inches smaller, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the champion's cuts, thus requiring Klitschko to play against his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has been particularly trying to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his cuts only made the champion very rare.
He's even the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, has exceeded the distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
Klitschko insults the treatment of "vilain zombie" which "is not really capable".
During the heavy Friday afternoon, the champion couldn't prevent Johnson from causing him to fall down his snowy sunglasses "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko was repatriated during his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a nearly four-year break, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "sa's" WBC belt that he had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his champion's title, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez de Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
"I just took a break in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is British David Haye who, detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, takes the WBA station.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was supposed to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company intends to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Minister of Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (the Link) request the explanation channel.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition called on the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) to have deliberately disclosed certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formed a controversy" on the murder of two tankers in September last, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday at the release of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he's lying.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
In substance, the content of the report contained in the NATO report, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the purpose of the strike was, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO survey report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the American Air Attack that had been launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, Commander of Kunduz.
The Verts, the SPD and the left asked the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in the shortest time before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Kunast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the targeted mass strategy is part of the Afghan government's policy if the federal government has approved this new strategy by Chancellor, Army and Information Services.
The Government's speech has rejected these criticisms.
The Chancellor had no influence on the military's intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, more and more votes were made to express doubts as to the true reasons for the resignation of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert, as had been presented by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had sent to Guttenberg regarding the attack on motor vehicles was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have illustrated the existence of the NATO report and hid some of the relevant details to the Minister.
In the context of the two senior officers, it is possible to hear that they reported several reports to the Department of Defence, including a document on two pages from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The "Frankfurter General Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested an e-mail clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Ministry did not want to comment on these charges and referred them to the Federal Parliament's investigation committee, which would be the following Wednesday to bring light on the facts.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, however blind, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything will be fine.
When we are extended into our bedrooms assobriated, we can discover without obstacles to our dreams and the most common fantasies.
However, the person who wakes up to experience the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not understand, has rushed the reputation of being naked or drugged in our Western world, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices appear only in mental illnesses or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is the cause: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint tables or write novels, but it sometimes influences the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality to be founded.
A state of consciousness, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best cases called the vision, at the top of the sheet.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the diamonds, the psychosis and hallucinations are imputable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliriums when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirium thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always been concerned about the relationship between folie and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 "a great similarity between folie and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delicates and sensory illusions that make it".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a design band.
Its body is in two dimensions in curved colors.
The earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it plans at the edge of the ceiling.
He's feeling a little bit.
Behind him are the devil's creatures of ease, grisly, the inhaling mouth, showing their teeth.
They continue to give him feet with heavy flamboyant boots, the jettant against the walls, it feels pain throughout the body.
Toniturating, mechanizing, screaming, out of walls and radio.
He can no longer support those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, actually a bottle and attachs it to a crochet attached to the ceiling.
He goes up on a buffle and goes through the hole around the neck.
He's coming.
The hole's broken.
That's what you need to learn, the voices cry in a heart to pull the tympan. "Go to a clinic and make yourself look good!"
Today, at 40 years of age, Henning T. has lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
She was fired by the LSD.
Diagnostics: psychosis schizophrenia, paranoid, in addition to maniaco-depressive, takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis, I have experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About a hundred people suffer at least once in their lives from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics, the most common after depression is the disease.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are in a state of extreme excitement, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationshipal follicles or persecution.
He is very capable of hearing voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are no longer rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is buried under the senses.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a march of ideas and fantasies from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the CHU Psychiatry Department of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrene is located in the centre of the situation, all of which is centered on it.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the ability to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, revealing is excluded.
Do the experience once in your life of hallucination.
The difference between dream and dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality which is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The thought and subtle hallucinations are based on reality, the alignment of the vicu took place in a real framework.
Why our brain makes this kind of cauliflower, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on monkeys have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers believe that the people concerned are suffering from brain infections.
It is assumed that brain neuronal maturity is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way the anomalies of the neuronal system occur and increase the fact that it has not appeared for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, though there is a predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain's hot.
What's crazy is, we're told by Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to escape while others buy expensive drugs to search for them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a point of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and illusions for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
The hallucinations are well part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to note that in some cases even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memory fragments that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the brain areas that deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cold; when our brain is warm but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of incentives, stress, love chains or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants acknowledged having done at least once in their lives the experience of hallucinations.
In 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town in Meckleburg-Pomerania and went to the university.
A young girl does everything normal to say.
If he didn't have any pictures and voices.
During the rehearsal, it happens that a young boy, a girl, to the long Chatian hair, addressed the word to him.
When she answers her friends to look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a lunar dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bank.
She may even realize her presence right away.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young sympathetic.
Are you crazy? Ask her sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
Night appearances are, in general, exhilarating.
The visions are often heavy.
When she's in class, she can't follow the course because the teacher's right to present a new student in her eyes and ears while he's invisible to others and that the teacher's clearly explaining equations to the table.
Night appearances are, in general, exhilarating.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for the dream that happens too rarely and very late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or asleep already, if the images she sees, the smiling faces or the young girl with bloody arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, it creates these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or friends, they'd take her for a fool.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. today is 20 years old.
She had her back last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in contact with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
The folie is also an art work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, it is likely that he has hallucinations for some time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, making sure it's in animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old, that the man she called Father, since she was old to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noise, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "in place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advised his patients to treat hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on conscience, we are unhappy to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and medical director at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative - folie is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called onroid, a particular form of change of consciousness revealed by dream.
The oniroid vicus are very complex semi-species that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and can not differ from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of oniroid consciousness is manifested during trauma or extreme pathology situations as well as for patients with a fully conscious polyradiculopathy who experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of oneself and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a mental limit state between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change is taking place, but the real situation is represented in imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, a capacity of organization that is given to us men to avoid falling into a state of unconsciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Creation of Heart" as a life-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience left him for a journey several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to remain immoble in reanimation.
Clossen swims in a world that has created all the parts, visitors to foreign places, travel in time. He sees himself as an old man high in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his head protecting his health.
He lives at the age of one of the nobs that produce blood-based smokers.
He was taken away by a Greek motorcycle that drove him to his country, he was in bed with his hospital bed in the Neve of the Alps and met a great Korean man.
It is absorbed entirely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen these internal trips are basically different from any dream.
The dream is a whole different state, he writes by describing what he has lived.
In contrast to dreams, memories of mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even in later years.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than real life.
The intensity of this life reflects the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the onroids, psychosis, hallucinations and psychiatric experiences show us how much our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summaries the Kasten psychologist "may cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very enriching.

Burda
At 27 years of age, children will be following home.
Kallen's appointment at the PDG post of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants his two children to re-enter the press group, said Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% of a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his society between the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate society, said 69-year-old Hubert Burda to Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then be raised.
They will also need to see if they can.
We can't force our children to 7500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to care for them.
That would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda had informed on Thursday that he had returned from his position as President-General since January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Governing Council since 1999.
He was the first to be responsible for the technology sector.
He then took over the Tresor sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of the marketing, foreign, printing and finance sector.
For the first time, this is not a family member who is at the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda were 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that holding must remain 100% among the family's hands.
The destructions have always occurred in families who have been left behind by a capital storm, which have made huge unfortunate speculations, thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of the country's predecessor as it could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international links like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Quality
All you can wish, in terms of beauty and well-being, by hand.
This is the goal of the English Court, which has just entered the commercial centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, opens prestigious teachings such as Hedonai, laser epileptic specialist, Spaxion, with its rooms of relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, coiffers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or the Octatine and its natural cosmetics, among others.

Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona Ayuntamento, created the 'Offina LIFE'.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Offina LIFE' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric vehicle in the city and will implement arrangements on mobility, by taking steps, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the construction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Séville are coming to join the project.
It is the three cities selected by the Government, under the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The Endesa electricity company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalonia.
It is aimed at promoting research and technological development activities in the autonomous Catalonia Community.
The latter include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero engages "a future of peace" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, introduced "a future of peace" for the Spanish car industry which, he recalled, was the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Government's 2009 President's Economic Report, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the car sector.
"Without the Automobile Competitiveness Plan, today we have a land of departure, closure of some of our main production sites," the President of the Government said.
"With this plan and the decision to remain in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can look forward to a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including in the Integral Plan for the Automobile Sector (PIA), devoted EUR 800 million to 19 projects and 137 subsidiary companies, which have mobilized investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The Executive Director explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government measures to support the application, in addition to the 2000E Plan, in collaboration with autonomous communities and motor enterprises.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and has contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Collection Hall, a meeting space for professionals and passengers from the world of the engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Dublin of Crystal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are a 20 000 m2 exposure area, with over 200 national and international exhibits.
We will not only find motorcycles and pickup cars, but we will also find them in ClassicAuto Madrid of all kinds related to the engine world.
In this way, among the pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring the happiness of collectors and couriers.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Cupe-France Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Classic Cochera, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this hall will also include parallel activities: collections, sports exhibitions, performance tests, presentations and competition.
Ability tests with car and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit located outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda understands that sports spirit is not limited to respect for the environment.
To this end, she has just integrated the engine stop and start system on Mazda3, baptized i-Stop, a device that is available at least for the moment only on the engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it received in its entirety.
Details, vehicle finish, habitat, behaviour, mechanical, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
At the beginning of the driving position, it appears that the existing seats present excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheeler is also particularly pleasing to him.
By continuing with the whole table of control and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a future interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as red and blue living colors.
This style reminds us, in part, of Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that as well as Mazda3 that both Japanese and Japanese are opposed to the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, which all want to survive.
This compact Japanese car offers more than sufficient accommodation to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to this, there is a great contribution to regular forms.
The automatic braking and start system of the engine, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with a manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the masterliness of its consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not make a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop engine with both its high speed comfort and its master consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model selected for the test is Sports, i.e. the one that presents the largest number of series elements.
Among the series equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) who removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, on-screen monitors on a large screen, stationers, independent air-conditioning, rain and light cap, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-point alignment routes, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version contained the Premium Pack which, for more than 1,500 euros, includes among other elements of bio-xenon adaptable parades and a BOSE audio system with disc loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make a lot of miles per year will be able to choose for the i-Stop version associated only to the engine of 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconsistencies in this model are its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxory finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sport.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" luxury
L.A. covers the red tape incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever shown us, dressed as elegant and sexy models for the exit of Nina. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", also sophisticated as usual, had opted for a "lady" shadow.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at its email, without offering the opportunity to see certain types of joint parts or to navigate on the Internet.
He uses his five minutes of glory in the United States when Time magazine designates him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly subscription and price, or less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one design exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He's as limited as his American brother, but he has a surprise.
Its monthly subscription price, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up the data when crossing a border or looking for a coffee shop on Wifi (or a connection to the Fund) to be able to see their mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and this has long been what it should do.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have a physical thesis to understand them and good moons to read the little characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission's order to propose affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have had a significant impact.
Outside of his country of origin, data are not used, and there is no harm.
That a small device such as the FonPeek (he is always curious that he is called the Fund while he does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to enable them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other online research.
No subscription and no gallery.
It's a connected device and it's paid when it's bought and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life like Peek has already been offered to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If Barack Obama became the president of the United States with a dress and a coat of that colour, she had, in fact, chosen the same thing to accompany him in the second moment, no doubt the most important thing of her life: the return to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michele Obama had a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow to the green with bright reflections, the two times, the garment was made of three pieces: the garment, the garment and the coat, in the same fabric, and it was adorned with a large brothel or a necklace.
Although from the first eye, it would seem that the first lady of the United States was following the seal of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to return the same ones.
But the fabric in which the two sets are scaled makes them very different.
If it was an old tooth, instead, it would bring to Oslo a printed scroll.
The accessories are also different: medium-sized green shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but expensive, this time.
She has also changed her coat: hair is now raised while she carried them back the previous time.
75% of working mothers had occupational problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what is revealed in the study "Fecondity and Professional career of Women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of mothers working have seen their limited professional career due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences as to the start of marriage and the number of children, whether or not they work or not and the type of employment they are employed.
Those who do not have work outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, are getting married faster, have their first pregnancy faster and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, rest their income in marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age who have a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after they have been installed together. This figure goes to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to resume the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment employed has a wide impact on maternity, but less on the date of the start of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"There is also another distinction between women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have conducted elementary studies have married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have conducted secondary or higher studies invest in this programme and give priority to a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," explains Mrs. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth a lot
Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will carry the image of several brand products, enthralling the universal prize "Because I love it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, has thus brought together other celebrities in the Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last to paint in this club were the Evangeline Lilly (Lost) actresses and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomical lessons) and Matthew Fox (the Evangeline in Lost).

The Poker of Manuel Vincent's Aces
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a dozen "radiographies" of writers who have passed through their literary life (and sometimes their other life).
He does not do so according to predictable and learned species (biographical summaries, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the ignition of the person created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not spare neither the frayers nor the lights.
This book is also an exciting invitation to read and read.
I'll leave you here a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I have found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, one that I felt unnumbered: pleasure against evil destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between the impudence and ignorance, with a poetic smile that revealed a sense, like the hand of the knife that failed to kill him.
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that will last for thirty years, in the flesh in which he combines the emotion of the adult to the pleasure of the repute, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of loss."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be recorded by the northern face, on which the best alpines still hang and still take."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
At times, he said he was the heir of a land owner of the county and sometimes when he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collects the cry from a bridge by this Munch character to bring his echo to the bottom of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he throws it in his own escape and invoking the succession with a speech violent to the ascetics."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels and prays: "God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were the words of Spencer: "The dream after the effort,/ after the storm, the port, the rest after the war,/after the life, the agony of death. "
On Virginia Wolf: "She also carried her depressions in her bags.
Her husband agreed very much that she would tell her that Edward VII was playing it between the assailants or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been such a patient and loving man of a nervousness whose literary talent went beyond the folie."
On Pío Baroja: "What does Martín-Santos mean if it's not to try to imitate Joyce at Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if it's to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did She do if it's not to breathe the glory of this man so that he serves him as a pedestal?"
A Lonely Aggression
The last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, went to our village of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged 15 and 18 years passed by her and our dog, a blood-bleed, saved from SPA and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they set him up two pairs of feet that left the seriously injured dog.
Our anger is immense because we do not see what it is that has to do with the free assault of a small animal that was, moreover, left behind.
It is necessary to add to this the denial of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, comes to fear for her physical integrity, because an animal attacker is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly person, or, finally, anyone less than him.
The episode took place at 17 hours, one Tuesday as another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog ate all day.
We have heard a complaint from the district commission, even if we doubt that this is a major cause and not to affect the sensitivity, we just want to make it clear that the killings were Spanish.
The denial has led us to deny this fact.
We don't understand what's going on in young people so they can find out that they like to abuse a free animal that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has been carried out.
Michelin and Fesvial, assembled for the port of the case
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the case, mainly among the young motorists, as the two structures are described today.
The purpose of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the port of the cache, as it is the only protection element to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was included in the line with his commitment to road safety, which "go beyond the design and manufacture of products increasingly safe" and stated that it contributed to this objective by other educational and information-based actions.
This new boosting campaign for the port of the case in two rows, under the heading "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which displays will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest circulation.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of two-wheel tyres, one of its main objectives is to develop more and more safe products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles progress
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent in 2008 compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 months of reduction, according to the figures of the parent trade union of Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers.
However, the good news should be heard, as the reference to the comparison, in November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60 per cent decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the redundancy of the last month, the accumulated immaturities during these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous period.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (tourism vehicles, pick-up vehicles, vans, light trucks and light trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
Large clouds that affect their most demand are not so dissuasive; although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are carried out by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases due to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions imposed by the limitation of banking credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions should be added.
In the face of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E was useless.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who want to buy a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations is itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (cars and buses) was again reminded.
The concessionaires' association provides for a 2010 year similar to the one that is completed, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As with the ABS brake anti-locking system and as with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European vehicles.
They are also already mandatory on tourism vehicles and newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of absence has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union is aimed at strengthening the protection of pets, even if it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant is increasing the pressure on brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system by the driver.
But this last one doesn't always keep pressure up to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch vehicle components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to support the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, however, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the vehicle needs to be stopped.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pets could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these smart emergency braking systems: it is estimated that a nistre on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on brakes.
If the driver reacts, he will help him by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collusion is inevitable, the device will exert maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors rest until January of the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Figueruelas (Saragosse) plant were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – after Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
This may mean that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers then to the Governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be reported until early 2010.
Instead, at GM, we ensure that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish Government has continued pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also strives to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's application for Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes into account the importance.
In the case where there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Sab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
A flight from the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to design their last and precious bee, Porsche engineers are part of the Boxster S and have managed to threaten nothing less than 80 kilograms, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a handbag to reduce 21 kilograms, to use aluminium doors such as the GT3, 15 pounds less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 pounds, to reduce the exhaust tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of win, to mount sports bags, 12 pounds, and with 19 pounds light tyres, five pounds.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning six other kilograms, and replaced the bridge doors by teaspoons, saving the remaining kilograms.
Although the model also exists with the double-blown PDK box, the test has been performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the streets of the secondary California network, on the mountain, with particularly turquoise screws.
Its behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The reduction in weight does not prevent the vehicle from rolling on the ground with alumb.
On the contrary: it has long been done that we have not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in the veins, including at great speeds.
It's a small athlete, capable of excavating his little muscles during the time necessary, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push again his engine...
That's what we want, because of its direction, as well as the communication it says, the car will do what our hands will show on the flight.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Volcano engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "port" option or through a system that alters engine cooling, already used on Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the end or at recovery.
Suspension is closed, but not hard or unpleasant.
The passage of the roads we traveled with Boyxster Spyder was quite flat, but the car was well managed by dust niggas.
The electronic assistants have made a bad impression of being present all over the road, while in some veins we've found the candles early in the morning and gravel later in the morning.
Finally, an ultralegre car, which is the most fun to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70 831.
“ Keep on the Watch ”
The intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, the icon of the Coco Cocoon line and the occasional starlet of the missing house, the singer shows his face of a bad girl with as much content as his Chanel bags.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's "Bag Girl".
Basconia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral received a triumph at 91-82 on his visit to Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus located in the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight panels at three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team has met the important absences of Herrmann, Olison, Huertas or Mikov by a large commitment and collective work dose, even if it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, great skill from the perimeter, with 16 pans to three points marked, is widely determined by the final victory.
The match began quickly for blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four panes of the Victoria team were marked from the perimeter, made it seem that they had flown into the Israeli territory with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from the end of the first quarter of the 18-20th century.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose the inner game of Barak and Eliahu's work, which was received by appeals and applause to return to his old house, to increase their benefits (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to become the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although the "minimum six" of Splitter's evaluation already had to warn that this night should not be the best of Brazil.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track, nothing was played, far away from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Victoria that we were not getting so easily on their ground, and thanks to “the hand of Elias”, they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the benefit of the ice on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from dead, needed some action to take the air, and that is when Mirza Teletovic's missile emerged, with three consecutive panels and the help of English and Ribas, returned the account to a life-saving score (54-67), and that the premises were able to speed up at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play all over the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they deserved during the first 30 minutes.
However, Pinini and Eidson, the best of their teams, did not re-sign and tried to support it from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter deleted for errors, Ivanovic's players did not anticipate, defend themselves well, and although the Israelis were approached in the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory fled to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Pains Prevent Unicaja from Getting a Battle
Unicaja has lost a lot in Greece to the Olympics and has given her the head of Euroligue's Group B, at a match marked by the absence of unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freland, Lima and Archibald), which have facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been shaken by the atmosphere of the palace of peace and friendship or by the vastness of the rival, of course one of Europe's most powerful and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed the Andaluss to dream. An aggressive defense and three Panthers at three consecutive points, two of Mr. Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio's local team revealed in the ninth minute.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the inner game of Bouruusius, Vujcic and Schortsanitis allowed to reverse score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of packing, between the North American miners Beverley and Williams, led to the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing superiority in both camps, while the release of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three false personnel were weighing on Unicaja.
The Lithuanian internal players and Linas Kleizas, with their three-point panties, increased the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
A Remountable
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even reached the difference between the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, leading to the cancellation of the group's head.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the latest exit from the green pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, through its organization, the three-point panels of Cook, and Lewis' support, left a bit of hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because the Olympics seemed implocable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian Pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeds in remounting the score at 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja surrenders, accepting the victory of the Olympics.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the pay they would earn by using their profile, thanks to a new application of Find, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you pay?" calculates user salaries from more than 140 000 jobs available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
From a week after the application works, the search engine detected that in general, the Spanish worker "has been paid badly", explained in a communiqué to the product manager Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British computer programmer received €45,226 gross annual and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish received EUR 24 000.
Similarly, a driver earns EUR 34 247 gross annually in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Findit, the least paid job in Spain is the servant, with EUR 11,592 net annual, followed by the seller, with EUR 14,725, and with the employer, with EUR 15,667.
The most researched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of drivers, temporary jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in Tegucigalpa's embassy.
The vice-president will have to leave diplomatic law no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for affairs of Brazil's embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on Global TV that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He realized that he had to find another destination from 27 January, following his mandate."
The chain also mentioned the former mandate, which confirmed its intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is from the earliest possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election of 29 November (at which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya made sure that he would remain in Brazil's embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally closed, as Zelaya refused the political exclusion condition that would impose on him the government in fact chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After a few days since the last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by an uncertain nature.
The reimbursement used by central banks to stabilise markets was to finance the debt by direct and indirect purchase of assets by providing liquidity at close zero rates, so that financial institutions can buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been practically finalised and, without prejudice to their non-compliance policy, start to put a little sense into the loops, as the ECB has done, with their award for a year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain an economic relationship without heterodox measures, and we are in favour of investing in risk premium reduction.
The flexibility of the exchanges and the differences in the obligations of companies is growing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were committed to socializing the private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is a new approach to quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been selected by investors, causing increased differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was severely affected by this period of instability, but then Standard & Poor was threatened by a new revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to raise moral risk defenders, who tried again to raise a case of awareness among global economic policy leaders who had compounded the destructive effects of the restriction on employment destruction credit, while a new day of grace should be described.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain power in the emirs and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that distinguishes a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the power of roses.
I sold it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duráo Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country in the euro area not to comply with its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has inspired the Greek Government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with a phase of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few exceptions in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as our public debt gap increases to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry about them.
If European differences were to decline and we were to continue to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The standard & Poor's case is anecdotes. When our forecasting indicators require most of the study services to predict their retirement models and to review their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not raise much hope for their warning.
Again, this would be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "wisdom is a mother of certainty".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the Sub-Commission of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain has been discussed these days for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, who was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán excavated for the press what he had mentioned in front of the Sub-Commission at eight-closes.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and 60 000 million more between this date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power stations today will remain open.
If that is not the case, the necessary investments would not be raised to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
In contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the issue has changed, and the power will need to be increased.
Its pari focuses on both gas and carbon centres, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MWs are more necessary, with other "supported energy".
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the Government has just approved is in the line of what his company claims, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which contradicts the policies against climate warming.
According to him, there is “a long-term clear pari” in this sense, despite the "pointing" measures, as the President of Iberdrola qualified them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must start to be taken, because they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.

Actiona argues on its first route to Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Akiona is struggling for her first delivery route in Australia, which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The playroom is an estimated $1,700 million Australian tunnel (about €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Akiona to be established in the country as a public and concessionary company.
The mayor of the city wants to be able to make it available for the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to run the project, as part of a business plan under the auspices of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the landscape.
In the wake of the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to US$ 1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase, there are three consortiums, with a significant presence of European builders.
The baptized group Transcity is led by Akiona, the only Spanish company in the league, and its partners are BMD and Ghela.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
The Consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, is against the Actiona team.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Lighton (the company of the German constructioner Hochttief, which is around the ACP's participation), another local company, Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galloese company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises large buildings and privatizations, but entering it is a major challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, remains an invalid step for the Spanish genders in the sector.
ACS has been unable to acquire a place on this market by participating 30% in Hochtief, owner of Lighton.
Millions of assets
Action is based on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other activities, it has the largest oil park in Waubra (102 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for the creation and management of Adelaide's desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure markets.
The underground road, promoted by the city infrastructure Office of Brisbane and Northern Link (Northern Line), is called to link the western road of Toowong to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project that exists to reduce traffic in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the 2010 season and that the work will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this road will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not intended that the bridge be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will two times include two roads, an electronic footing system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief widely fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company held by ACS will, through its local branch Leighton, equip the infrastructure of the national network with optical fibre.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have rapid Internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has submitted the construction project of the King George, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not started yet, and Hochtief has completed the sale of 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.

FCC can contribute a tunnel to Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine branch, can help build a 2.1 km tunnel for a road in Slovenia, for a amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after it was charged with the expansion work of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a total of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The launch of the building is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is looking forward to helping the advertising of Renfe
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies who were present at the appeal organized by Renfe, among which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity during the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
An increase of 63 million in France Télécom to boost competition
The French competition regulator influenced an amendment of EUR 63 million in France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopole and still a state company, has been spending over 450 million euros on amendments since 1994, due to the obstacles it has put to its competitors.
The damage suffered yesterday was also increased because the competition authority considers France Télécom to have committed similar crimes in the past and therefore reciprocity.
An application store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile phone branch has followed the seal of other operators and opened an Internet application store with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In the beginning, the Orange application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, the Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which placed them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that made the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is the head of the list.
Manchester United is the head of the list.
Gaining the U.S. Championships League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from major clubs.
In fact, the competition has allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to the EAFRD information.
The Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well served in this department.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophies three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former Cup of Europe in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
On the list head are Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that have also made the most money for their participation in the final League of Champions.
And that, even though they've lost them in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more than one title (five, while Italy has won four, three England and two Germany).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex currency distribution procedure applied by the EAFRD.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
From this sum, EFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the classification match (including the Madrid Atlético) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million only to be there, plus €550 00 for each match.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (€800 000) and equality (400 000 per team). Those who arrive in the eighth quarter receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the fourth quarter receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, in front of the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, as part of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million and no more 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça has earned 2.5 million to win the Europe Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, which are devoted to 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and it has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion won 40% of the money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid in accordance with the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29,9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group outlined the details of the purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital yesterday.
A percentage that does not require him to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the total title.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1 % per year for this report.
Yesterday, Sos' actions ended at EUR 1.85 ; New Rumasa's offer therefore evaluates the company's 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects Sos' real assessment.
The offer is conditional on the designation of eight of the 15 advisers.
The group of Jerez provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the company of Ruiz Mateas has claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were located, the decline would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos' capital would be 254.27 million.
In the meantime, His will continues the restructuring of its direction.
In an attempt to remain outside possible purchase and sale offers and vas and to become judges of its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the election of María Luis Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision by the first woman to take a lead position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group's president.
And he is not exempt from policing, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged decline of more than 230 million of His to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility for new fund transfers can not be separated in the coming months.
With regard to the Salazar credit, former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) announced yesterday to the National Auditorship that they had been informed of the degradation of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CMV authorises the OPA for the exclusion of Paterinna presented by Inversora Sea
On 9 October, the National Securities Market Commission (CCMV) authorised the OPA exclusion presented by Inversora Sea on Federico Paterina.
The supervisory body explained that it had authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it would consider the content of the explanatory note submitted following the amendments made on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, which represents 8,95 % of social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiation on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were reallocated and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the end of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New vehicle expertise tools
In these days of bad times and accidents, car garages are not the only ones who win.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been hit by a ladder are reduced to a garage, where an expert must assess the damages and the cost of repair.
Each left is different, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate the cost of a repair of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, including the parts and the working hand, may take two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The service providers and solutions for the evaluation of the sinisters and maintenance are involved in collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating them and offering them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American Group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the trade director of Audatex, the company in Spain has 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed has not been increased, although over the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than during the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies are working.
This is a very expensive job, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and entered its price.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphics image is set for each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car.
If this is a massive sales model, the work can be done in one week if the process progresss very fast.
If this is a low-saleled car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has full information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information on Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 per cent.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audadex has eight centres across the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (general experts in mechanics) work simultaneously on three screens of computers.
Audadex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to provide different uses and to offer different products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools for the management of waste parts or to calculate the venous or residual value of a vehicle.
The only company with a guide on the value of car rentals in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not propose it in our country, but does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support it can bring to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the fair product is AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of sinisters, for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes account of the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting boards.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers using it at least 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it comes from the assembly chain, only through its number of chassis.
AudaGlass focuses on the wines of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open server in the online professional sector that allows you to search for vehicles that have been declared explosives.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or identify current problems by brand or model.
It is possible, for example, to study how many models of a particular brand are taken to the garage for a panel or how they have been subjected to severe syllables for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the parts, prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Insa group, founded in 1971, as a service provider and evaluation solutions for the sinisters, pans or maintenance of waste.
The GT evaluation guide is a historical reference product on the market.

Inches on the Internet of accidents in cars
In October last month, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motor vehicles and special vehicles.
The operation involves a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could extend the next year to 15%.
The acquisition objective was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an enormous international market.
This estimate and sales service is addressed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional sellers who must be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
More than 1500 sellers and 4,000 experts are currently available on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to the Spanish law, a vehicle whose number of chassis has been removed can no longer move, but instead, some parts that are not covered can be used as spare parts.
The collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been withdrawn after complex departures.
Four-stage garage duty
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a loan in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare, create a loan and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals that, to a greater or lesser extent, they are opposed to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all land, 137 motors, 78 trucks and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer and Internet connection are needed to use it.
Once the model to repair identified with its chassis number, a real graphic picture of the model in question appears then the necessary room is selected.
The user may include variables such as the labour price, upgrades or reductions and may print the loan to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the person assigned to the garage does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be made subject to a credit.
Currently, Audadex works for these images to be three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see from a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
