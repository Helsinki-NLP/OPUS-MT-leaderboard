Members of the Welsh parliament were concerned about 'just the same as an added film'
Some members of parliament were surprised when they heard a tweet that they would be called MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is the result of an attempt to change the name of Parliament of the Parliament of Welsh.
They're all worried that members of the parliament from all political colors will become people's smiles.
A member of the parliament of one Labour Party said his group was worried because it was "warning against Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means stupid.
Members of the Plaid party also said that all members were "not happy" and offered other suggestions.
A Welsh National Heritage says his group has a "open mind" about the change, but he says that the offer of MWP and Muppet is very close.
In this context, the "w" letter in the Welsh language is the same as the "u" in the English language in Yorkshire.
The Parliamentary Committee, which introduces legislation to include amendments to the current name, said: "It is clear that only members of the parliament will have the last word on which the members of the parliament will be called."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the citizens’ opinion on the proposals, and it was found that there were many who supported the call to parliamentary Parliamentary Welsh.
With regard to the name to be called by members of the parliament, the committee's attention was to Parliamentary Welsh or WMP, but the MWP was the most supportive option when people were asked about their views.
The members of the parliament seem to have other suggestions, but the head of President-in-Office, Elin Jones, who should present the draft bill on change within a few weeks, may be discussed in a joint search.
The reform law also mentions some changes in the way the parliament works, such as the rules on the removal of members of the parliament in its place and the committee's system.
When members of the parliament argue about this bill, they can vote for the last vote on their name.
Macedonia's voters vote during a public poll on the change in the country's name
On Sunday, voters will choose to be called "Northern Macedonia's Republic" by their country.
This public survey has resulted in a decade's decline in neighboring Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia.
The officials in Athens have long confirmed that the name of their neighbours in the north is being violated, and they have always ignored the last request to join the European Group and NATO.
Macedonia's President, Lord Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the public's request for a change of name, said that he would think it was no less important.
However, those who support public opinion, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is only a change of name to join the European Group and NATO.
St. Martin's Palace was closed when the congregations in Harlem were at war
"As a story, the older ones who talked to me said that all the streets were filled with drinking houses and congregations," says Atoa Adams.
"Now, it's all gone."
I can only say that it caused the drinking house to disappear.
"People's communication has changed a lot" at the time, he says.
"It's still difficult to make the drinking house a comfortable living room."
For the church again, he is concerned that the money paid by the church's leaders will not last as long as they sell them, "they will return soon or soon as they start again."
This church, he said, could be replaced by a room for the homeless, and it would be the sort of people who would not care about the remaining holy places around them.
"Most people are going to buy housing in these buildings," he said, "to be sure that these simple congregations will soon end because they are not sure that most of the people who live in them will enter the congregation."
The two congregations were set up as whites, when Harlem – the great city in 1870 was not yet a black town, and became St. Martin ten years later.
In the 1930s, the first white Methodist congregation was formed.
At that time, a black religious organization that had recently gathered took the house for its own.
Rev. John Howard Johnson led the black congregation that took St. Martin, who led the people who would not be assigned to the participants on 125th Street, a very busy road in Harlem, because they prevented black workers from receiving black workers or the development of black ones.
The house was very expensive in 1939, but when Moper Johnson's church was able to redesign it, they cut down many children's chairs.
Rev. David Johnson, Mopera Johnson's cousin and moved to St. Martin, he was proud to call these children a "little cousin."
But it was the name given by the specialist who pointed to the many plays that took place in July: "Cultimal pride" and "an unreputable history."
While this specialist also noted, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, this was the first generations to be visited by black leaders on earth, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest generation in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Attoa Merriweather said that St. Martin no longer sought a man to replace him.
In a few months, the events in St. Martin were a little tense because of the conflict between the building system and the building industry, some of which were held by church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The council wrote to the diocese – the church’s executive office, including the councils – in July stated its concern that the diocese “is seeking to transfer the church’s vote” to the diocese, but the church’s council did not enter into agreement with the builders and construction companies of the diocese.
Some church members complained about the lack of attention from the diocese.
The 13-year-old boy who went to California for surgery
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy in California was injured when he attempted to commit suicide on the day of the launch of an antipsychotic year, the authorities said.
The accident took place at 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel's story at the KSWB-TV in San Diego, they had been busy for half an hour since the morning hearing of the boy who was shouting a bell call, and several of them died quickly to approach him and pull him out of the water.
I thought he was so happy that he got a bribe, Hammel said, but then he realized if he called it "I'm saved!"
I'm buried!’
Her neck was completely torn apart, "which Hammel looks like when he came near the boy.
"I cried very hard to get out of the water quickly: 'There's a nest in the water!' Hammel said.
The boy was sent to a plane that saved the Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his life was still in serious danger.
It is not clear what kind of nest it was stored.
The Capt said during the interview with the journalist. Larry Giles said about the time of life that people had seen a ghost in this area a few weeks ago, but he knew that it was not the kind of monster that bothers people.
The upper part of the victim's body is very poor in terms of heights called Atoa Giles.
The authorities have taken over the seabed for 48 hours until Pointo Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for the investigation and protection of human life.
There are more than 135 species of bats in the region, but most of them are not believed to be affecting people.
Sansbury's campaign is moving into the UK's fashion market
Sainsbury's has come to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and uses the same space-forming facility as a large store and a special-skilled space provider.
In an effort to find a place in the U.S. environmental market of 2.8 billion Libres, which does not increase if the retail and retail market is too high, the larger areas will be placed on 11 magazines across the country, and will be sent to other magazines if it seems to be successful.
In the time of the major magazine for the use of television shopping sites, the most recent use of money in the form of television has come from the heart of micro-ondes.
Sainsbury's said she would increase the size of her shopping area, which will last for 3,000 years, and find a sign such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, who will be present.
Similar features such as L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees will also be more widely available and will bring special features to the media like Boots.
This huge magazine also re-emphasizes the forms in the bottle to give special attention to those who do not have the product – according to a growing demand from young customers.
In addition, two French shipping operators will also be involved in the special marketing appointment in the Sainsbury magazine, and the first one opened in Croydon, south of London, and the second will be opened at the end of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As the number of people who choose to spend the Internet and buy less food each day on the city market is increasing, large stores have to make great efforts to attract people to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, General Tale of Saninsbury's, their sales will continue to be similar to large stores according to the efforts of large stores against customers such as Aldi and Lidl through more services and food products.
Sainsbury's sales of Argos have placed many magazines, and the Habits have been adding a lot since they bought two magazines two years ago, saying that the sales of daily goods increased significantly and the market share of the magazines they bought increased.
This huge magazine has intensified its efforts to give new life to the physical and medical aspects of it.
In early 2000, Saninsbury's tried to spend money with Boots, but the share of the dissident share of the drug's magazine in its large magazines was destroyed.
But this new strategy was born three years ago when Sansbury's 125 million Libres bought in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, the 281 pharmaceutical network he owned.
He stated that Lloyds would be responsible for that format, thus helping more productive groups for such respected brands as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four different magazines.
In particular, Paul Mills-Hicks, the sales director of Saninsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the appearance and experiences of our country's cultural heritage so that our customers will be better able to make the world a better place.
We also used the extra money from employees who received special training, who are always willing to make suggestions.
We have a huge impact on the needs of all of us and because of the close and possible public environment, we have become an improbable place for natural beauty, thus changing the pattern of traditional imagination."
Peter Jones was 'strong' when Holly Willoughby gave up the 11 million Liverres deal
Peter Jones, the most famous actor in Dragons Den, was deeply impressed by the "swift" that Holly Willoughby, a television broadcaster, rejected the 11 million Livers deal with his company on the subject of gambling, because he turned his attention to his new relationship with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's character.
People said that the sale of the two sets was similar to that of Goop which Gwyneth Paltrow's has made.
The provider of this morning program, now 37 years old, told Instagram that he had broken the agreement.
Peter Jones, the most famous actor in Dragons Den, was deeply disappointed by Holly Willoughby's last seconds in the life-threatening company – but he turned his attention to the new agreement he had made with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was said to have been “hardly disappointed” when the most expensive television programmer at a meeting held at the headquarters of his large company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that as a result of his new agreements – estimated up to 1.5 billion Livres – he no longer has time to be alone with the Trily cook and housekeeper.
The sale was compared to Goop's Goop on Gwyneth Paltrow and was thought to increase Willoughby's average capacity of 11 million Livres.
On a private plane, Jones left Great Britain to save one of his temporary departure homes, Willoughby, who is now 37 years old, told Instagram that he would leave Truly.
One source says: "Truly is the first level of pride for Holly.
This is exactly what his far-reaching future will require, so he will be safe for the next ten years.
Everyone is ashamed to hear their decision to leave.
Everyone didn't believe when they heard the three events here, because the date was about to be opened.
There's a magazine full of things to buy at Marlow's headquarters."
According to experts, this morning's program, which is part of the most expensive star in Britain, may cause millions of injuries to the company, and may reduce the start date.
They may also end up being friends for a long time.
Jones and Tara Capp have been close friends with Willoughby, who have been born three, and Dan Baldwin's husband.
Capp and Willoughby built the Truly company together in 2016, and in March Jones, 52 years old, took over the place of Tale.
Both of them are running hard and Jones has 40 percent money in Baldwin's company.
Willoughby will now see the location of the M&S signpost and will replace Ant McPartlin with the I'm A Celebrity program on ITV.
A news source close to Jones last night said, "We can't talk about his business."
Strong words 'from now on but we fell in love'
He made his resignations by journalists because he made a possible comment that he did not “see the beginning” and because he had hope of North Korea's president.
Why was President Trump so angry?
A response from Attoa Trump said and took the sound of the "new provider".
"I've never done that."
Kim wants to hold a second meeting, when Attoa Trump said that the first meeting they met in Singapore in June was a major step towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the debate on nuclear disarmament is still under way.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore last June, North Korea's highest diplomat, Atua Ri Yong Ho, attended the United Nations Conference on Saturday, announced that North Korea had not yet seen a "coherent step" in its first arms production process.
The US is even more demanding to impose more pressure on us.
There is more hope than that of Trump's speech in his speech during the campaign.
"We have a very good relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We have already gone to war in North Korea.
Nearly a million people have lost their lives.
But now we have a good relationship with them."
They took advantage of their efforts to improve Kim's relationship – stop the fusée attempt, release the hostages and put down the American soldiers' flag.
And she strongly protected the unusual view she showed when talking about her relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like the President, but let's see 200 people standing here, like 10,000 people outside the dining room are not involved," Trump said, and he led the people who stood before him.
An island in Indonesia has been devastated by tsunamis and earthquakes, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, independent organizations from abroad received messages that they do not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's residents were injured, there was no declaration of natural disaster, but it was necessary to provide international assistance.
"Many times they regret that they said clearly that they did not ask for international aid, but that we were seriously concerned," Rtoa Sumbung says.
Although the Save the Children are already preparing a team to be sent to Palu, foreign workers are not yet known for working locally.
According to Atoa Sutopo, director of the Natural Disaster Bureau, the Indonesian authorities are still looking at the situation in Palu in order to find out if permission is given to assist in providing assistance to international offices.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquake, the country’s refusal to face the heat of nature is likely to pose a real threat.
It is true that there is a shelter if there are tsunamis in Aceh, but it is not a city that creates other rivers.
The absence of warning signals in Palu may have been part of an increase in the number of deaths, although warnings have already been issued.
Despite the most difficult times, it is difficult to travel on many islands that are bordering Indonesia.
The existence of natural disasters is just too difficult for logistics.
A hospital ship in Lombok asked to arrange for the victims of the earthquake to go to Palu, but it would take at least three days to get to the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused his campaign on elections to improve the already-rooted system in Indonesia, and he contributed money to roads and roads.
Joko's regime is very fragile but the lack of financial assistance, especially in the coming year, will face elections again.
The conflict of different religions in Indonesia is also still a problem waiting for Joko, as many Muslims live their faith in a more traditional way.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives or escaped the consequences of the conflict between Christians and Muslims across the street, using guns, other weapons of mass destruction.
Look: Daniel Sturridge died of Liverpool's player's great-great-grandmother Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from being shot by Chelsea at the Premier League on Saturday because of the dead ball in the 89th minute of the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a gift from Xherdan Shaqiri when she was 27 meters away from Chelsea's chain, which led to 1-0.
He tried to get the ball to the left, which he just went hard to save the most distant tree.
The ball went up high, saved its right arm from the handle.
But then the ball went out on top of Kepa Arrizabalaga, where the ball hit the top and went into the hole.
"I was just trying to save the place where, as it gets the ball, players like Shaq always run the ball as soon as possible, which is why I tried to create a long time for myself," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I thought the ball first, and then I didn't work very hard but I was my cousin."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the march because the Belza Eden Hazard star killed a ball in 25 minutes.
At that time, the attacker returned the ball to the Blues by Matthew Kovacic, and then he jumped suddenly near the center of the camp and looked very close to Liverpool's allies.
Kovacic offered a ball in the middle of the court and quickly fled.
Then she went to a couple of players and led Hazard to the tree.
Hazard did not break the race on his side, so he came to the top of the tree, so he took the ball to the left to get Alison Becker, Liverpool's boxer.
Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday at the San Paolo camp in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, however, Chelsea will meet Videoton in London, in UEFA Europe League.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia is 832
The number of people who lost their lives as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia is 832, according to the Natural Disasters Bureau on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have not come out under the earthquake’s roof of 7.5 on the ground floor, which has caused seabeds up to six feet [6 m], says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman in the press interview.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is surrounded by potatoes and trees from broken houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old black man who killed a woman in a prison.
The investigation was opened this morning for killing people after seeing the woman's death in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman's body was completely damaged when someone was found at seven and 55 minutes in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for being threatened to kill him.
The police tried to get them to what the locals might have seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: 'The investigation is still starting, but it's encouraging those around us who may have seen or heard something that worries me to come to us.
I'm also calling up for someone, especially drivers, who have received photos from their cars that can help with our investigation.'
The police officer confirmed that the dead woman was living in Birkenhead and found her in the house.
This afternoon a friend was thought to have come to the village to ask where his death was good this morning.
The investigation continues, so the police said they are now reporting the news to the victim's left.
There was a driver living in Grayson Mews who was about to return home but the police stopped because no one had access to or exit the previous house.
He's taken when he knows what's going on.
The residents are now informed that they may be able to return to their homes for hours.
Some heard what the police told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the place and cried.
He's always saying he's back to 'dangerous'.
On 2 evening there were two police cars in the uninterrupted area, and another vehicle was waiting outside.
On the other hand, several police were standing in the uninterrupted area, watching a whole building.
The news reporters are asked to send direct messages to @MerPolCC, call 101 or send anonymous news to Crimestopers via number 0800 555 111 and report case 247 on September 30th.
Cromwell's signature in parliament is the last cell that has been hit by the section 'rewrite the story'
The removal seems to have returned to poetic form, as a result of its destruction in the same way as the Taliban’s practice of cultural and religious cults in England made by its supporters who are professing to be champions of strict religious traditions.
The Cromwell Association said the idea from Atoa Crick is "a fool" and "a plan to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is impossible to be confused in this debate on the painting that Oliver Cromwell must also be discussed in front of the Westminster Court.
But Cromwell did not command or execute the photo and print damages that took place during the British Home War.
Cromwell is not going to sacrifice this because of what Thomas had done in the past century.
The beauty of Cromwell's appearance by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft and the evidence based on the opinion found in the 19th century and part of the picture of a highlighted person who is now considered worthy of celebration.
The Sunday Telegraph said: "Many people today, and perhaps more than the land in the late 19th century, consider Cromwell to be the guardian of parliaments not to be affected by external pressures, in his day it is clear that the king and the queen did so.
However, it is still a continuing historical debate to this day whether it is a true expression of its form.
What is certain is that our country's development was planned later in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is known to all to represent one aspect of that reconciliation.
It should also be celebrated and celebrated as Lord Protector."
A Chinese plant that dies with a root of the fish’s size
A farmer lost his life when he stole the stocks of cheese in a market in the south of China, according to local journalists.
The man, known for his name "Yuan," was near the bathroom, found that he had a major blood flow on him, he was completely bleeding in Liupanshui's market in Guizhou, while South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a cheese confectioner in the cheese market is preparing to make his cookies in Xining, Qinghai, China.
This is Wednesday from Yunnan province around where he and his brother sell 15 cash in the market.
The next morning her cousin saw her dead, and she noticed that the door of one of the bathrooms was opened.
He found a big man's shirt with his mouth shut.
In an investigation, the doctor confirmed that the man who weighed 250 pounds [250 kg] was the cause of the disease and killed him, the report said.
"My brother's legs are bleeding and his feet are cut," said his brother, named after the name "Wu," as he told Guiyang Evening News.
A photo that monitors can show that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 mm in the morning to make his profit.
About an hour later his death was found.
The animal that killed him wasn't even Yan or his brother.
The market manager told Evening News that the case of another person's arrest had been investigated separately before, until the local police had collected evidence.
It seems that Yuan's family and market officials are competing about the sky because of his death.
In the past, though, there were cases of fraud, even though it was not possible to do so.
In 2016 a married couple were injured in their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a large goat weighed 295 pounds [295 kg] on a tractor used by a Welsh farmer until her husband threw the animal.
Once again, a farmer in Oregon was injured by his accident in 2012, a Manitoban farmer told CBC News at the time that it should never be eaten that he could only be “red” if he heard a blood transfusion.
"He's just playing.
They're predators, they're trying... but they don't believe in harming people.
You just need to be careful in front of him," he says.
The rest of the Rosa Crisis will bring water to the southern part of the United States
As environmental analysts have said, the effects of the Rosa River have decreased as the colder waters reach the southern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will have to carry water for several days across the northern part of Mexico and the western part of the United States.
Rosa’s atmosphere reached 135km per hour, which is said to be a Sokakyi 1 in the morning at 5 a.m., and 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is thought that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
On the other hand, there is a depression starting to develop on the Pacific Sea, so the tropical waves of Baja California are moving slowly towards the western coast of the United States as far as Rosa is concerned.
Monday, Rosa will take a stream of water up to 25 cm in many regions of Mexico.
Then, thanks to the combination of tropical depression, there will be a huge wave of heavy rains to form in the south-west in several days.
If one area gets 2.5 cm of water up to 10 cm, it will reach a watery river, a drought and a drought, and there may be an earthquake in the land.
As a result of heavy tropical rains, there will be a stream of about 5 cm to 8 cm per hour in some areas, especially in some areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that 5 sm of water will reach 10 sm in some parts of the western part of the country, especially across Arizona.
The sea may also be affected by the sudden deterioration of the climate as tropical rain levels are still spreading.
It is true that walking out of the earth should always be stopped because of the potential presence of tropical rain.
As a result of the floods, the canyons can turn water into water and there will also be a powerful wind and wind that is based on the heavy rain.
The accompanying depression will also bring water to some areas on the southern coast of California.
There may be a stream of up to 1.5 cm, which may lead to a flood of dirt and roads.
This is the first raindrop in the region for the north.
Monday and Monday morning will begin a tropical rain to reach Arizona, before the more rain comes on Monday and Tuesday.
From Wednesday until Wednesday the tide will be clear throughout the Four Corners.
In October, the crisis across the United States may change considerably because the Arctic will slow down, but the tropical environment will still burn.
Sometimes it can cause a lot of changes in the drawings in the surrounding area.
On Sunday, there was an outstanding example of this dramatic change in the landscape across the central part of the United States.
The contrast between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, has almost reached 20 degrees.
In the next few days, however, the heat will try to gather and resuscitate in the autumn.
It is expected that the beginning of October will be abolished for most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, so that the map of the South Pole will reach almost 80 degrees to the north.
The Trinity may be 80 degrees in New York City, about 10 degrees higher than the moon.
It is estimated that long-term efforts are likely to be made to rise above normal salary for the rest of the East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Bret Kavanaugh's door arrest
On Thursday more than 20 million people were watching the alleged witness by Brett Kavanaugh, expected to be appointed to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, accused him of having acted in an activist manner in the 1980s, on six televisions.
On the other hand, political corrections continue, so the TV closed its program to report on the most unexpected events: an agreement signed by General Jeff Flake from Arizona to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
The Law Committee in Ford's Chamber of State said he could make 100 percent sure that one day he was dead at Kavanaugh and started to take off his clothes during a lycée student's party.
But he replied in Kavanaugh, during a stand-alone witness, but he was able to make sure that 100 percent did not.
There seems to be no doubt that all of the more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen here have followed.
The company called for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TV viewers.
It is not yet known, however, that the label for other televisions that sent it directly, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also often the most difficult task to expect the number of viewers at work.
With a simple comparison, the American football viewers or the Academy Awards are similar.
The Fox News Channel is the head of all televisions, which has been found by researchers who strongly supported the appointment of the Kavanaugh Tower, as 5.69 million viewers have reached it during the day-to-day interrogation, says Nielsen.
The second was ABC, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
People are still very interested after their door-to-door arrest.
Everyone focused on Flake during the collapse of the history of the Zoma.
When the office of the modern Republican General said that he would support Kavanaugh's Day with a few stones to do, the CNN and CBS were able to print a photo by protesters when they tried to get into an ascensor to save their appeal by the Law Committee.
He stood but had a look during his many minutes' interview, as seen directly on CNN TV.
"I'm standing here right now," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
Someone said to him, "You have authority, but many women cannot see each other."
My office has already issued a statement by Atoa Flake, and he added before the elevator closed that he still had something else to say during the committee's interrogation.
After that, all television broadcasts went directly to doors and children, at the time the Committee of the Smallest Law on the award of the Kavanaugh Act to the entire House of Commons.
But Flake announced that he would not do that if the FBI did not accept a week ago to investigate the person's claim to be appointed, as a few Democrats have requested.
A conversation he had with his friend, Mayor Chris Coons, Democraty.
Flake agreed after talking to Atua Coons and a few mayors after that.
There was a force that was chosen by the Flake because it showed that the Republic's authorities would not be sufficient to accept the appointment of the Kavanaugh Tower if the investigation did not exist.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.
Prime Minister May accused his critics of ‘political games’ about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his way out of the European Union, "playing political games" in the future of Britain and challenging the interests of the country, during a discussion with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, September 29, 2018, came to the Meeting of the Conservatur Party in Birmingham, Britain.
In an interview near the first-page Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former Foreign Minister, confirmed his claim to the form Chequers for Brexit, stating that the proposal should be “slowly misleading” both Britain and the European Union.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being killed by LSU player
The police arrested a man suspected of shooting Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and imprisoned for killing an innocent person, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The response to Sims and Simpson was released to the public by the authorities, and the police announced that Sims’ eyes were missing during the war.
The police from where the crime took place, reported Simpson's DNA was found, according to WAFB's report, working for CBS.
When Simpson was taken out of custody, the police said he agreed to shoot and killed Wade.
The value of his temporary freedom has been defined as 350,000, says one spokesman.
Zoma issued a preliminary report by the East Baton Rouge Parish Bureau, which said death led to a shot from the head to the tent.
The service thanked the police team for those who had escaped from the state police in Louisiana, the state police assistant lab, the Southern University police and the citizens around the investigation and were released from this arrest.
According to Joe Allenva, the LSU's athletic leader thanked the district police for their "his determination and his always seeking the truth."
Sims is now 20 years old.
The 1m82 Baton Rouge is the largest character in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU in this town.
During the past year, he had a 5.6 number and a 2.6 ball in each game in general.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach About Will Wade said the team was "full" and "hard enough" when he heard Wade's death.
"That's what worries people all the time," said Tatoa Wade.
Volcano in Mexico City
The storm from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern city of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Natural Disasters warned the people of Mexico on Saturday to avoid the volcano because there was an event in its mouth and the number of tons of salt and salts written within 24 hours was up to 183.
There are also a number of noises and demonstrations followed by the nearby scene.
The image of a snowflake covering the traffic chain in many cities around Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, draws attention to social networks.
Geography and the earth’s bodies have been seen as an increase in the volcanic events that took place in 72 km east of the capital since the earthquake reached 7.1 degrees in the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been alive since 1994.
Police and Catalan refugees quarreled as the memory of the lack of self-determination is near
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday when protesters fought against the police for independence, and thousands of those who took the lead in the march to mark the first year of Catalonia's stalemate.
A number of people have broken up with police officers who are unable to progress, but have come out of the mud and dust, and the streets should be filled with tourists at such a time.
There was also a riot that occurred last night and the police used a knife to separate those fighting.
Several hours were the groups of volunteers who shouted, "No one's forgetting, no crime" to their partners in the country's alliance, complaining, "I'm going to live in Spain."
Forty-six people were treated for minor injuries to protesters, local journalists say.
On October 1, one year after a public poll, the war in the areas of independence continues to be raging, which Madrid said was illegal, but the Catalans celebrated.
Almost all voters chose independence, but few came to vote because they refused to take part in the vote against the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year when police were about to stop the drop of stones from the oil stations around the region.
A number of people were involved in independence during Friday night to stop those who were trying to protest to support the national police.
There was only one shortcut but another one has to be used.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, a powered engineer who attended the refugee movement with his wife, said that he no longer believed that Catalonia would be free again one day.
"Last year we had the best thing to do.
I remember my parents being happy because they could just throw stones, but now we're on the road," she says.
Even though the Catalan volunteers have been able to win a victory, which involved a small number during the last December's regional elections, this year the party has been concerned about the risk of getting involved because many of its leaders have become on the ground or in prison waiting for a trial to be held for the public trial and subsequently declared independence.
42-year-old Joan Puig, a car manufacturer, recording the demonstration to support the police on his cell phone, announced that politicians on his side and side are now facing a dissident situation.
"The army is always on the move," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned for the past year, announced that he will be elected to be a member of the European Parliament next year.
"The stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to read the rich democratic heritage and the key to the success of the government in Spain," he said.
Londonsderry: A riot in the house, several men arrested
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested when a car broke down several times in a house in London.
The accident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Sunday at 7 a.m. and some BST tomorrow.
The doors and walls of the house were really damaged, says Det Insp Bob Blemmings.
Maybe someone shot a kid at the house this evening too.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 by Menga's Day
The first ball of Dolly Menga for Livingston has won
The Rangers, the only second defeat for Steven Gerard in the 18th game as the leader of the Ibrox team, is the murder of Livingston.
It's Dolly Menga's brother, since Gary Holt's team can be the same as the Hibernian.
Gerard's team in Premiership has not yet won a victory in the country this year and will be fighting Hearts this Sunday, which has a head and has an eight-digit advantage.
But on Sunday, in the European League, the Rangers will take the Rapid Vienna.
Livingston has not yet won this game in this new division, as Holt's coach has been winning since he passed on to Kenny Miller a month ago.
Livingston can't face his heavy blood
Holt's team has always been guided before its death, as they have caused various problems for the Rangers since the end of their attack.
Scott Robinson was just broken but the ball didn't break when he hit the head, and then Alan Lithgow could not do it again until after he dropped the ball by Craig Halkett his head.
The householder had no reason to let Rangers play in front of them, as he knew he could do it to raise his guests in a good way.
And it seems that the number that changed the story was the most.
The Rangers made a mistake leading a cop-franc and Livingston was looking for a way to get a ride, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson agreed to give Menga a ride, which really got the ball and broke it from the middle of the day.
But the Rangers were still on the beach, but they never read the householder's address, so there was no danger of questioning Liam Kelly's wooden guard,
It seems the same thing for a second time, even though there was a case from Alfredo Morelos that Kelly had to arrest soon.
Scott Pittman also almost killed a ball but it was hit by Allan McGregor, a Ranger’s watchman, and then Lithgow’s team was very disappointed when he received a good supply of food from Liverington’s player.
The gang did not break up into Livingston's box but was still banned, and there were two penalties – one result of Halket's failure to replace the actor Glenn Middleton, and one result of the shooting with his hand – but was thrown out altogether.
Livingston's "No's Likes" - Sneaking · Global Voices
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, on the Macaroni Arena Tower
Livingston's play and performance did not look like him.
There was no motivation for what they did, and they did not stop doing more than they were thought to be able to now go up.
There has been little change in how they play and how they set up the team since they're back on top, but Holt has been particularly impressed by their ability to connect the team until they arrive.
There are also many professionals in their teams.
Captain Halket's success was great, leading to the ultimate protection of the program, but Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to free himself during the game.
However, the Rangers did not seem to have much to do.
It may be that they play well at times under the leadership of Gerard, but they have not achieved their goal here.
Their attacks are not always slow – they are once moved from the square – and should now be alarmed for Rangers, as they are now not going to be low.
Erdogan's reception in Cologne is very exciting
On Saturday (September 29th) the morning meal of Turkey's president and Germany in Berlin was short and blue.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's most critical visit to Germany – which was made to restore relations with NATO fighters.
Among the topics that they have ignored were human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
After that, President Erdogan obtained a new major mosque in Cologne.
This city is the largest country in Turkey outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 people were prevented by the police from meeting in front of the mosque, but there are still many supporters coming to see their president.
However, hundreds of opposition to Erdogan – and many Kurdes – expressed their opinion and condemned Erdogan’s policies and Germany’s willingness to take him abroad.
The image of a foreign believer was seen in that protest against it, some Turkishs calling German citizenship a savior, but others accused it of being a traitor.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The driver killed the car wrecked
The bus driver in London lost his life.
In the vicinity of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street office, there was an accident, a busiest street in Deptford, east of the city, at 10 a.m. and 15 a.m. BST.
The car stopped, and a doctor came to take care of it, but the man died of a lack of water.
The accident took place several months after the dead bicycle driver who fled from Childers Street, or about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they're trying to find out about the man and listen to his family.
The road is so open that the passenger cars have to travel abroad and have been invited to choose another route immediately.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prison Guards wounded during the siege · Global Voices
Six prison guards were injured in a safe prison for men, says the Prison Office.
Tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. and some BST began the attack at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire; and it is not yet over.
Specialized police called "Tornado" have been invited to organize the riot, which brings together eight prisoners, in a prison cell.
The prison guards were treated locally for the mild wounds they had.
The prison service stated: "A special trained prison guard has been called to destroy problems occurring in the HMP Long Westin.
Six prison guards were treated for his injuries.
We're never going to expose the violence in prison, and our statement is clear that the security officers have to give the police their time."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including prisoners among the most threatened prisoners in the country.
According to a report in June, the prison chief had to be hospitalized when a prisoner was wounded.
And in October, some prison guards had to call police officers who were in trouble because of a massive bombing of ballast billard.
The Rosa River threatens to create rivers in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (it can be a privilege for the region where the hearing is located)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it can occur at the beginning of the week, as the rest of the rivers from the Rosa River continue to read the Desert Southwest, and are threatened with flooding.
South California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, have already issued a warning of the sea.
Rosa is thought to be heading straight to Phoenix, bringing water to her home in the afternoon.
Phoenix's national weather company tweeted that "the tropical wind with tropical temperatures or depression when within 260 km around Phoenix is ten" since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is the only wind that has reached 60 km near the AZ region."
According to the most recent estimates published by the National Weather Station model, the raindrops can reach 5 cm to 10 cm, and it can reach 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
The other areas in the Southwest Desert, such as the middle Rockies and the Great Basin, may be 2.5 cm to 5 cm, but there may be some places to reach 10 cm.
For those who are not worried about getting water first, Rosa’s water may be a blessing because it is a part of the world’s environment.
It's true that water is very dangerous, but it can still be good to get a drop of water because it's now dark in the south.
According to the U.S. Office of the Watch Tower Society, more than 40 percent of Arizona's reputation is strong, the second most powerful type, according to weather.com reports.
The Rosa River was first thought to enter the country in the Gulf of Baja California in Mexico.
In 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico is the Rosa River, which runs north at 20 kms per hour.
The wind is decreasing because the Pacific Ocean is colder.
Thus, it is thought that it will become a tropical Tempe when it enters Mexico on Mondays or Sundays.
Mexico may have a heavy share of water that can cause massive floods.
"It is estimated that Baja California will be able to go north to the west of Sonora, and it may reach 25 cm in some places," said weather.com.
Then Rosa, who is already tropical in the north of Mexico at that time, will travel to the border of Arizona on Wednesday morning in the form of tropical depression, again following Arizona to the south of Utah.
"The most significant disaster is the heavy rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwest Desert in the United States, which are thought to be caused by Rosa or the wave of floods,," says the National Weather Survey.
As a result of this rain, there will always be a river that will die and the flood of trees and rocks on the ground, and the fall of the mountains will be a thing of the past.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton: Arrest of four people planning to kill
Three and a 20-year-old boys were arrested because of the fear of being married to murder, when 16-year-olds were found in Somerset.
In Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, the child was diagnosed with a serious illness, the Saturday morning at 4 a.m. BST.
She was taken to the hospital immediately and was said to be “free of anxiety”.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested on the night around Radstock, said police in Avon and Somerset.
The police told people who might have got pictures of what happened on their cell phone to approach them.
Kavanaugh said about Trump · Global Voices
"The lack of stones for Judge Kavanaugh is a lack of stones to stop the protests of the Democratic Party," Atoa Trump said during a public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Atoa Trump announced that during the Kavanaugh's appointment, the latter was "encouraged by the enthusiasm and anger of the Democratic Party."
On Thursday, Kavanaugh stood witness before the Congress, and he left off the charges made by Christine Blasey Ford to commit sexual acts with him ten years ago, when they were both children.
During that time, Ford also came to witness about his accusations.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people will see the beauty, skill and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"The less stone to strengthen the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is less stone to be appointed by one of the most perfect legislators in our time, the more well-known judges the people have been serving," he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The President has failed to speak about the importance of the arrival of the candidate Republic during the election of the candidate who used to talk about the appointment of the Kavanaugh Army.
"The last five weeks will be one of the most important elections in our life.
I don't want to be a traitor, but if it's true, I want to be a traitor," he says.
"That's why I'm going to fight for the best candidates."
Atoa Trump said that democracy is even taking a "convention and blockade" race.
The final Friday should be the first important milestone in the House of Commons in the Kavanaugh Summit, said the top GOP leader at CNN.
Hundreds lost their lives because of the earthquake, tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims has not increased.
At least 384 people contributed, many of whom were killed by a massive sea storm, after a great earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, said authorities on Saturday.
There were hundreds of people gathered to meet at a seagoing festival in Palu, there were ships up to nine feet [6 m] in the morning covering the beach, and many people were injured and destroyed everything they had.
Before the tsunami there was a 7.5 earthquake on the ground.
"When the tsunami was alarmed yesterday, people continued to do what they had done on the sea but did not run away, but became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a BNPB spokesman, a Natural Disaster Bureau in Indonesia, during a talk in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, but drove a car, wood, house, and ate everything that was left in the black soil," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami’s conversations on the seabed reached 800 km each hour before it hits the lake.
There was a man who cut wood that the tsunami had not killed him, he said.
A total of 16,700 people were transferred to 24 refugee camps in Palu.
The photos taken from the planes published by the Natural Disasters Bureau show that there are many buildings and shops that are damaged, broken and broken, and mosquee surrounded by water.
The city of sea-creaming cities on Saturday is still under attack by the storm.
2.4 million people live in the region experienced these earthquakes.
The Indonesian Institute for Technology Reduction and Implementation (BPPT) said that it was about 200 times the size of the atomic bomb that went through Hiroshima during the Second Great War.
The tsunami’s magnitude may have increased, they say, the city’s geography, which is based on the bottom of a long river.
Nugroho declared the destruction and thousands, he said, the homes, hospitals, shops and hotels were destroyed.
He said that 540 people were injured and 29 were left homeless.
Nugroho says that there may be more casualties and destruction in the Donguria region, 300 km north of Palu, as it is the closest of the earthquake.
"The website is very excited because there is no news from Dongrya," Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in the statement, and its employees and volunteers have already saved the damaged areas.
"This is serious, but the situation may still be worse than it is," he said.
On Saturday this service received a lot of criticism because it did not say that there was a tsunami in Palu, even though the authorities said that shortly after the warning, the storm came.
There's a photo of people who spread on social networks with men on the top of the street calling for people's lives on the streets below that there's a tsunami.
A few minutes after the flood struck the lake, they lost all their homes or cars.
Reuters could not verify this to be the original image file.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunamis, almost all of the streets around the city were blocked and no one was able to netize around Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to manage emergency efforts.
The authorities said that the army had already begun to send aircraft to the army, brought aid from Jakarta and other cities, but many of the people who were forced to move to live needed food and food in the morning.
The city airport has been opened for a long time, and it will continue to be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was said to visit the camps where the victim was placed in Palu.
More than 800 people died from tsunamis in Indonesia.
This is really bad.
It is true that the workers of the World Vision from Dogrya, who have been working in the labour market, have been restored to Palu, but they have seen a lot of damage along the way, says Atoa Doseba.
"How many houses they see," he said.
This is really bad.
Many of the relief teams are now starting the hard work of emergency weather after natural disasters, but some complain that a large number of foreign workers are being prevented from going to Palu.
According to the law in Indonesia, there must have been a national declaration that a victim's natural disaster had occurred in a place where he could introduce money, configurations and foreign workers.
But there was no record of that.
"The natural disaster is still in the first place," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the state says, "Well, a whole country is affected by this natural disaster," it can be opened for international aid, but we are not yet here."
This is the second night in Palu since the earthquake and tsunami came here, and friends and family of those who have not yet found their freedom are still hoping to be among the miracles that bring a little happiness in this natural disaster.
Asobtsy is a small child who has been shot alive from a cold water stream.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who was in a van for two days, along with her mother's dead near her.
Gendon Subandono, the national Indonesian paramedic team, trained two non-smokers for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
He is also a student of the other areas of the Two Two Hotel, including Atua Mandanga.
"My heart is heavy, as I am quiet in the parapente area," he said.
Atoa Gendon reported that a few hours after the news spread among the parapente's agents that the Two Two Hotel was destroyed, he quickly sent a lot of messages through WhatsApp to the contestants from Palu, who participated in a sea conference.
However, the message he sent was only one red character, not two blue characters.
“I believe they didn’t even protect the message I sent,” he said.
The thieves spent $26,750 during GAB filling in Newport at Level
Friday morning the thief spent $26,750 on GAB in Newport by Brink's employees at Level, according to a press release from Newport Police Office.
The driver released the car into the GAB in a parking lot and prepared to set up additional money, said Det. Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was there, another man "promoted to come after the Brink's employee" and stole the money that was about to go there.
There were many witnesses who fled the area, according to the statement, but the police did not clearly tell the number of people who were protected in the area.
Newport police are encouraged to call the number 859-292-3680 that gives news of these people.
Kanye West: The rap singer changed his name to Ye
The rap singer Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter on Saturday when he said his name was changed: "The official name Kanye West."
There was a time, 41-year-old West, who received the name Yes and this was the title of the enemy file he released, which came out of June.
Shortly before his release on Saturday Night Live, which is thought to produce his new file called Yandhi, the name is changed.
He is the stranger to replace the singer Ariana Grande with the program, who left the stage immediately for “a emotional reason,” says the program’s creator.
West stated that he also had a religious opinion for him as well as a violation of the professional name he is using today.
"I believe 'yes' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of the year, when the program was talking about the title of his file to the provider of the Big Boy audio show.
"So I am and you, we are, we are.
So it started with Kanye, which means it's the only one, and it came to Yes – there's nothing but good, bad, negative, negative, all of us.
This file contains more information about us."
He was one of several famous rap singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs, for example, has already been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he should be called Love and Brother Love.
He was also there with his colleague in the West, JAY-Z, who admitted that his name could always be either a protest or not, either a rescript or a text.
AMLO in Mexico said he won't use the military to fight civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Mr. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, pointed out that it was his intention to use the military force to fight civilians, as the 50th anniversary of the blood strike was due to the pressure of the student protests.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that "he wanted to send soldiers to kill Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military fired the peaceful protesters in the camp, and at least 300 of them died, during the time when the student movement was officially received from the left-hand side of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans with a monthly grant for students and to open a new state university.
It is the lack of work and the lack of learning that makes young people excited to save a wicked society.
The cost of I.A. should be increased by the United States twice as high.
China is already making great progress in the field of artificial intelligence (IA), so the US should also increase its use for research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, the IA money user and user, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That was the comment he made when a different department in the US government made a statement about the IA, although a whole United States has no formal procedure for the IA.
In the past year, China has announced its plans: it has been focusing on the reform of the IA by 2030.
“It’s good to start with a two-fold increase in IA research, as the United States is more than acceptable than any other country, and we’re waiting for the most special information for IA now,” Lee says.
When the funds are increased twice as high as they are, the force may be twice as high as the United States as the biggest change in the IA's world, Lee says during the CRBC discussion this week.
Lee, who wrote the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the General Council of Innovation Ventures, which created one of the leading companies of IA in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University for an IA system that won the best American Othello player, and then he was a top Microsoft Research employee and head of Google's office in China.
Lee admits that it was a good competition for the technology provided by the former U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked himself when the next section was going to be able to identify those who are capable of bringing news in the future.
Lee often says that researchers in the United States need to work hard to get government funding.
"But Sina is not trying to get the academic leaders out; it's the company," Lee just said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology-focused companies have been targeted by various universities to focus on the IA field.
The change in immigration policy can also help the United States speed up its efforts for the IA, Lee says.
"My friends should give me a red card immediately to the IA Doctorate," he said.
In July 2017 the Chinese State Council issued the IA Development Plan in its new form.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China provides funding for people at the educational center, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations for American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year in the United States, the Ministry of Defence has set up an International Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which is aimed at bringing together industry and education workers, and Maison Blanche has announced that the Committee is now being set up to focus on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month DARPA will pay $2 billion for the event called AI Next.
For the NSF, however, it is now worth more than $100 million for the IA research.
At the same time, no action has been taken on the law in the United States aimed at setting up the National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonia's electors are putting a little pressure on public opinion on the change in the country's name
On Sunday, voters in Macedonia will be forced into a public poll to ask whether the country's name will be "Northern Macedonia's Republic" or not, a measure that will reduce the decades-old deficit to Greece, which prevented their intention to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, has always pointed out that the name of the neighboring country in the north is being violated, and it has continued to interfere with its entry into the NATO and the European Union.
The new name was agreed upon by the two regimes in June, but some anti-nationalists said that if the name was changed, many Slavs would be able to survive in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote during the referendum and that the result of the campaign would not take part in the campaign was likely not to understand the 50 percent requirement for the public opinion to be validized by the voter.
The question to put to the public is: "Do you agree to join the NATO and the European Group by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said that let us accept the value of joining a group such as the European Group and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia's disaster.
"I am here today to throw stones for the country's future, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live in freedom under the care of the European Union because this means a better life for all of us," says Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the law has not been defined that it must be followed, the number of parliamentarians has already said that it will follow the results of the strikes to make it change immediately.
Two-thirds of parliamentarians are required to accept the change in name.
The National Electoral Commission said no reports had been reported unconstitutional until 1 p.m.
However, not more than 16 percent of voters have been elected, while 34 percent have been elected during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which saw 66 percent of the voters named after the vote.
"Because of my child I voted, because we should be in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an electorate in the capital of Skopje.
In Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko came to the press for a public review of the change in the country's name to open the door to NATO and the European Group in Struca, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old in front of the parliament in Skopje, prepared a small workshop and set up a chair in front of the building that the robbers were about to take part in a public hearing.
"We want to join the NATO and the European Union, but we want to do so honorably but not in the community," Kavadarkov says.
"It is true that we are a poor country, but we have only ships.
When they don't have our name, Macedonia, we can return to China and Russia and join the European and Asia Declaration Group."
Access to NATO will bring immediate use of funds to Macedonia, says Prime Minister Zaev, as unemployment rates are already over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of people are affected by this because more than 80 percent of the citizens welcome the entry into the European Union and the NATO," said Atoa Zaev after the earthquake.
The victory of "this" he says will be like "the strengthening of our future."
As a result of a simple survey published by the High-level Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, Monday is between 30 and 43 percent of voters are coming to press for public opinion – that is, less than the number required.
Another simple survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
But 70 percent of them said they would choose "this".
The 50 percent of the voters contributing to a voter need to come down to the vote, which is likely to be successful in the public polls.
If this survey is to be completed, it will be the first major obstacle to Western governance policy since it took place in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has broken all Brighton's flag and died of a bullet
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton Prize when Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seems that Aguero's introduction of ballast in 65 minutes is easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a gift from the center of the court.
He broke down between the first three Brighton revolution, then spread out free of charge.
Aguero was suddenly surrounded by four black players.
He moved quickly behind the front of a tunnel, and then ran across many railways on the side of Brighton's railway.
After that, he took the ball to the left, so Sterling could.
When the English attacker shot the first ball in the ball field, he returned it to Aguero, who shot right and shot Matthew Ryan, Brighton's wing guard, because the ball was placed in his right arm.
"Aguero's left leg has a little problem," said Pep Guardiola, city manager, to journalists.
"We said he'd only be playing in 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what's going on.
We were very proud that he had killed a ball at the time."
Sterling but gave Sky Blues the first prize in this game for the Premier League.
He died in 29 minutes.
Aguero was then granted a service in the country of Brighton.
It's good to see the lady who sent the ball to the left of the stadium to get Leroy Sane.
Sane tried to advance the ball before leading Sterling to the far edge.
The ball was almost taken out of the stadium by Sky Blues.
The city will meet Hoffenheim in the group for the Champions League in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is willing to play at a meeting with Rockies
There was no reason to force the first to play, as the Nationals are no longer involved in the end process.
But Scherzer wants to compete so much that if he takes the ball this Sunday at a meeting with Colorado Rockies, the only measure is that the process of the end of the game is that they have an advantage in the Los Angeles Dodgers NL West.
Rockies won the joker's position when the Nationals won 5-2 on Friday night, but it's still hoping to win the first division.
"Although we have nothing to contend with, at least we are excited because we know that the air will not disappear during the dinner game with the viewers and other teams that I can be sure to produce the best in it, more than the best I've ever seen this year.
How can I not be quick to compete with that?"
So far, the Nationals have not announced who will play first on Sunday, but it seems that Scherzer is the one who will have to take the ball if that's the case.
On Thursday, Scherzer was accustomed to playing a ball, which would be the first of the 34th games to be played, and on Sunday he'd be playing football even though he had a few days off.

President Trump killed people in West Virginia
The President has made the situation around the Britt Kavanaugh that he has chosen to be appointed in his Supreme Court in the matter of the importance of the arrival of the caste Republic during his election.
"We're up to the top of everything we're going to spend this month of November.
The last five weeks will be the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the main ones, most important -- I don't want to vote but if it's true, I want to vote, which makes me fight for these good candidates," he says.
President Trump continued, "You see these very bad democracies, who are doing what they are doing now we are saying.
And they're ready to repress power in every way, you'll see the pleasure, the pain.
They don't care who they are, who they have to get power and control, which they need, power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats have taken a visit "to fight and stop," he says.
"And you'll see what it was four days ago," he said, saying that democracy is "fashioned, angry and bad and not to tell the truth."
He named the Dayne Feinstein Democratic Capital in the House of Commons Law Committee, which was launched by the meeting.
"Do you remember his answers?
Have you published any comments?
Oh, yeah, how?
No, mm, no, I'm waiting for one – this is the worst move I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a free congregation.
He does not give up on those who are willing to express themselves
No wonder the Momentum attackers in our village party threw stones at me to answer my questions.
In fact, I was the last Parliament of the Labour who said I didn't need my opinion – the reason was simple: I was grateful for the comment.
None else has received Joan Ryan, my colleague parliamentarian, because he has never been able to resist the Jews' enemies.
For me personally, my opposition to Jeremy Corbyn's opinion was the result of a series of criticisms.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe, which is particularly concerned about Jeremy's communication with the leaders of the past.
This is what the announcement paper for the Meeting of Nottingham East Labor stated on Friday: "We invite the meeting to be shared and to see its fruits."
During the more than eight years that I was in the Parliament of the Labour, the GC meeting was well filled with these measures every Friday night.
Sadly, however, the political promise “better and easier” is not the same at many meetings today, and it has been long forgotten.
Differences have become apparent in the Labour Party, and the opinion that the party's leaders approves is not acceptable and is good for all.
A short time after Jeremy's leadership began, there were colleagues with me who thought that I had the same political outlook that I had in the past had started waiting for me to turn blind and accept a view I could not accept – either on national security or on the European Union's global market.
Every time I get public speaking – whatever I say – the criticisms on social networks calling for my name to be removed, criticize the politics of the central party, saying that I should not be in the Labour party.
And that's not my own experience.
I know that it's even easier to get to me than to get some of my colleagues because I'm going to make a political comment.
I was surprised to see the professional work and the confusion of fellow workers who face criticism of a man or a woman who is rude but never shy.
One of the most disturbing aspects of our current political era is seeing how powerful words have become to everyone's mind.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of diffraction.
In fact, we are no longer the free church of the past, and we are giving the party every little bit of "trust rules" or change the rules on membership elections.
For the past two years, many of those who have suggested that I go easily and not get hurt, "I'm not going to worry."
But that was not the case with me.
Since I went to the Work Party 32 years ago when I was still a student, since I was impressed by the Thatcher regime that allowed the public school I had studied to be destroyed, I have always fought to improve the public affairs that I had given to those who needed most — whether city councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my policy, including during the last election.
No one here in Nottingham East can say that I did not understand my political ideas and things that I did not share with the rulers.
There is only one thing I want to say to those who have encouraged the loss of weight on Friday, when we see a country moving towards Brexit that will have bad effects on many households, businesses and public affairs, I can't understand what I'm about to spend time and energy trying to convince the leaders of the Labour Party.
But the truth is that my message is not for Nottingham Momentum but for people, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I respect your ability to serve and I promise that there will be no threat of attack or political abuse that will prevent me from taking what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie will not be parliamentarian for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Ayr, who has never survived
The last two days may have changed a little bit, but Ayr's winning this first game made by Tennent for Premiership this day, which was truly a great success.
They're now on top, because they're the only team that doesn't lose even once in ten.
In fact, the winning team has the ability to defend and exploit the situation, and Peter Murchie is the most just teacher if he is happy.
"We are still busy, but no one has touched us, so I have to be happy," he said.
This is what Robin Christie from Melrose said: "The Father is honored, because they have been more powerful than our team."
Grant Anderson made a move in 14 minutes, which was confirmed by Frazier Climo, which gave Ayr the advantage, but the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors not to play before, has been able by Melrose to take advantage of the lack of numbers and Jason Baggot has been arrested for a long time.
Climo had a penelage that covered the interests of Ayr, and then, before the funeral, he lost only a ball and insisted on it so that the Ayr’s lead number was 17-5.
But the second time for Melrose was good, and after Patrick Anderson, who was forced by Baggot, was reduced to five remaining numbers.
After that there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruardhi Knott, who had to be forced out of the court, and when the game was resumed, Ayr re-surfaced by Stafford McDowell's day, confirmed by Climo.
This is where Blair Macpherson, a temporary captain for Ayr, re-enacted Melrose's reputation and made sure Bruce Colvine was able to win despite the lack of support, after a brief confrontation.
However, the city was still closed, so when Sruan Hutchinson received a high-card card for sending a ball to Climo that did not carry a ball, from the penelage mark, MacPherson put the ball back on the line, behind the Ayr's closet.
Climo picked up the rape case, as he did after the game returned, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's suit off the line and offered a bid to kill the fifth head of the mayor's team, Gregor Henry, his side player.
The Still Game star seems ready to start a new job in the food house industry
Ford Kieran, a player at the Still Game, seems willing to start a new job in the reception industry, when he is known to be appointed as the head of a company that has been authorized to build a food house.
He's 56 years old, and he's playing Jack Jarvis's role on the BBC program, which he wrote and he's playing with Greg Hemphil, who's been with him for a long time.
He told his friends that the ninth phase will be the end of this program, and if Kiernan's vision is already ready for life after Craiglang.
According to the official document, he is the head of the Operationsorn Limited.
The actor did not answer the question about this news, but a news source in the Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan was planning to enter the "a lot outlet for a restaurant" in Glasgow.
'We are the sea': Bolivia, which has no border, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
La Paz is a ship that feeds the ship's ship's main shipyard.
State offices are as bright as the sea.
The Lake Titicaca Marine Corps is full of inscriptions like this: "We can have the sea.
We forget to take it again."
Bolivia still has a scar on the memory of the loss of Chile's coast during the 19th century's bloody war of resources, and the desire to recover from the Pacific Ocean has not diminished.
Perhaps that hope is not as alive today as it has been in the past ten years, as Bolivia is now awaiting the international court ruling on October 1, when they have been sentenced for five years.
"Bolivie has already taken good care of, united and positive, and full of hope for what will be possible," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice (ICJ)’s ruling on television across the country, hoping that Bolivia’s request in La Haye will be accepted by the court but – after a ten-year discussion – will have to discuss how to give Bolivia a route to the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivist president of Bolivia, is also looking forward to much of the decision to issue on Monday – which is facing a war that threatens to elect him twice a year later.
"It's too late for us to return to the Pacific Ocean," he prophesied at the end of August.
However, some educators think that the court can't be sure to give Bolivia justice - and even if it does, there is no change.
This United Nations agency in the Netherlands has no authority to give part of Chile's land to others, and it has already said that it cannot be held as the last owner of the word as a result of any possible discussion.
The finding that only six months after the submission of a statement by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is already suspected that the case, says Paz Zárate, a specialist from Chile on international law.
Bolivia's demand will never be met four years ago, but it will be even more humiliating.
"The current Bolivian government has taken the road to the sea," Zárate says.
The way Morales spoke may have made the remaining small slaughter in Chile a long time, he said.
Bolivia and Chile have to re-examine each other later, but it is difficult to discuss after this incident.
Since 1962, two countries have failed to cooperate.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representing Bolivia in La Haye, rejected the claim that the issue of the court is not as common as it is this time.
This Monday will bring "a good way to open a new relationship with Chile" for Bolivia, he says, and a time to be followed "the 139-year-old inconsistencies are a good way to get together."
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales — one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the issue of seawater as a political aid.
"Bolivie will never release his right to go to the Pacific Ocean," he continued.
"The decision to issue is to find out what we need to do until the past."
North Korea will never destroy nuclear weapons unless it can't trust the United States
According to Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, they will never destroy the first nuclear weapons unless Washington is trusted.
On Saturday in Ri, the United Nations General Assembly took the floor.
He urged the United States to implement the promise made at a summit in Singapore in the presidential capacity of these developing countries.
That's what he did when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, like the rest of the world, would reopen the nuclear diplomacy as it was before, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's leader.
Ri stated that the idea is "sudden dream" that the declaration that the war in Korea is about to destroy North Korea is promoting the punishment and opposition of the United States.
But Pyongyang warns Washington to accept the statement but does not even take a significant step towards the destruction of weapons.
Neither Kim nor US President Donald Trump wants to hold a second meeting.
But many don't believe Pyongyang is really ready to take the heavy weapons that the country is sure to take to safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the upper month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The latest results of the major haircuts that will soon come to you from a nearby high-end shop in Paris
Don't look too far if you want to help with the amount of energy you need or the sun will stop you completely.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have announced the headaches, which is the biggest and most evil to include in the section called SS19, at the top stage that identified the healing process during the Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram has been able to use these in this year's season, and the mold makers have sent them to the mouthpieces of the molds they created.
For example, Valentino’s most unusual heat is another large red light bulb, with large dusts such as the bull’s hair that completely covered the killer’s head.
Among the large holes found there are the stone walls, the walls of the masjiers, and some of them have been burned - but they have not been made to shake our heads.
There are also a number of strange faces shown by Thom Browne – very timely for Halloween.
Most of these paintings are very beautiful, and it seems that they are not very expensive as Hannibal Lecter.
They created a nest similar to that of a wet plant, which is made up of wind and wind channels, while another is like a dry but dry house.
And if you're going on a special fashion show, you're smart.
The observer suggests that these large stores may come to your nearby high-end retailers.
The words on the back of 'La Bomba' were silent, which had been made of the black bag with half a meter black bag, either Rihanna or Emily Ratajkowski.
There was also another important creative process that has been shown by this most famous brand, which has created these non-useable plants – a soft sea bag made of black beads and has to be much the same as the wearer who wears it.
This old box of red roses, with three green roses, was the most highlighted creation in the results of Jacquemus in the La Rivera SS19 series shown during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a designer for famous people, wrote on the FEMAIL: "I hope that the heavy fuel and the shipping chain will be coming to the top of the market – there has been a great deal to me about the creation of the miner, so it will be difficult not to see the future demand for a large amount of light."
John Edward: The world's citizens really need foreign language skills
The independent schools in Ecosse are well known for their success, and they continue in 2018 because the results are good, and the success of individuals and teams in sports, art, music and other advertising events has increased.
Over 30,000 students throughout Scotland are also working hard, which is being replaced by the Independent School Council (SCIS) itself, to provide the best education for students and parents.
The aim of the independent school is to support its students for higher and higher education, their careers and the world's position of authority.
As the education sector is capable of organizing and implementing comprehensive education programmes for each school, we now see that only modern languages are among the great electoral and educational branches of the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in his language, your words will come to his mouth.
If you speak to him in his speech, your words come to his mind."
It's a prison reminder that we can't just eat in English if we want to create relationships and trust with people from another country
As we look at the latest results for this year, it is found that foreign languages are leading to the most well-known sources of education for students of independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of foreign students received at least 19/20.
This news, available in 74 SCIS schools, shows that 72 percent of students received 19/20 in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students received 19/20.
This shows that foreign education is supported by an independent school in Scotland because of your ability to make sure that children and young people will be able to do so later.
Today, foreign languages, as the elected source, are the same as STEM (synthesis, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school and elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey of the United Kingdom's Commission for Employment and Skills, the U.S. Board found that when the user saw why it was said that it was difficult for him to involve his employees, 17 percent was because of the lack of help from foreign experts.
Thus, foreign language is a constant source of uncertainty if a young person is to prepare for the task that he or she wants to take in later.
This ability is very important in the whole world, as the number of jobs that require foreign skills is growing.
Whatever a person is doing, if he learns a foreign language, he will receive a great reward in the future because he can be used in his later life.
Those who know a number of national languages will continue to benefit from their competitors because they can communicate directly to foreigners.
According to a simple YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them do not know foreign languages in order to be able to communicate simply, and only French is their only language of 15 percent.
This is an important factor in raising money to improve foreign education today, for children today.
A number of foreign-language children, especially the languages of developing countries, will benefit from finding a job that is worthy of their life.
Every school in Scotland will be different from the country she teaches.
A number of schools will focus on teaching modern languages already available, but some will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the cause of your child’s interest, there are a number of foreign languages that you can always choose from an independent school, and teachers who are responsible for it.
The Ecosse independent school is willing to focus on creating a learning environment to prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is not possible at this time, in the world of full-time business, that foreign languages are still dependent on the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
It is true that foreign languages should be admitted to be "needed by the international network"
The independent school will continue to offer options, diversity and perfect working methods for young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is the Admission of the Independent School Council
LeBron will play the first Lakers in San Diego this Sunday
The rest will be waiting for the fans who want to see LeBron James play first in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, a Lakers teacher, announced that James will play this Sunday during the first game for the pre-legal period, to meet the denver Nuggets in San Diego.
Still, it is not known how long he will continue to play.
"One must be more than 48," said Walton at Lakers' official website.
Lakers' special journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James might have limited time to play.
Journalist James asked about what he would do during the six-to-six game until Lakers before the legal time of play, after the start of this week's self-examination.
"I don't need a game to prepare the legal time to be ready for my job now," he says.
A crowd party at Atoa Trump in West Virginia, China YouTube
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting a large crowd gathering campaign tonight.
This is the first of the five cases of President Trump during this coming week, including a short stay in nearby cities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
When it became clear that the resolution he had chosen to fill the blanks in the Supreme Court, President Trump, who was a year old, decided to support our upcoming election because the Congress's administration would be confined to the republic's headquarters after the fall in November.
How many of President Trump's public meetings tonight in West Virginia and how can they be followed online?
President Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia. Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow President Trump's public rally on the Internet via YouTube.
Trup may discuss the arrest of Britt Kavanaugh, who was scheduled to enter the Supreme Court, which has become an obstacle to the prosecution for a long-acting action and is expected to be delayed for a week until the FBI's investigation is completed.
But the main reason for this gathering is to help the Republic get a little boost to the elections in November.
As a result, President Trump's propaganda organizers said that this five-to-one public meeting this week is "to encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to keep and expand the majority of the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The main part of the program is the control of Congress and the president is taking over a number of states as soon as possible before entering the era of violent propaganda," said President Trump's spokesman, who did not mention the name when talking to Reuters.
In Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, the evening gathering is scheduled to take place, so it is possible to attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and journalists from Pittsburgh," said West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second day that West Virginia visited Attoa Trump last month, a state that won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's goal is to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate as a Mayor in West Virginia, who would agree if the investigation was a simple one.
"It is not good for Morrisey to see the president who has to try to force him to raise his number of opinions," says Reuters's West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team showed that he has the power to fight won't be disappointed in the fight on Sunday
After these three games were played, Ryder Cup may have been the most popular game on Saturday.
The claim that sports is a nude is a simple idea now, but players really believe it, especially in such a competition.
Who, then, is to blame for this?
"They've had six advantages, but now four others, it may be said that we're the only ones who get a little reward now," Jordan Spieth said before he started the world on a small race.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, leading to four numbers and there are still more than two dozen to fight.
The Americans, according to Spieth, seem to feel that there are only a few noises helping their teams and that there are many reasons for their encouragement, especially the goals of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played the world together and each received three to four.
Spieth's play from tea to green and even shows the good example.
The music of his part was always strong, so he died of a significant pontt and received a clear victory in the fourth game, and both he and Thomas were not enough after the two rounds.
That's why he's been complaining about the hit they've got on the 15th floor, the kind of bird that says the American team is not too old yet.
"It is absolutely necessary to have a competitive and unsound attitude to your game alone," Spieth said.
The rest of them have two players today.
It is a total of 18 names.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players that have more numbers than Spieth and Thomas in two days, which is the story of the Ryder Cup.
They have four numbers in four games that appear to be disunited but deadly from Europe, and they don't seem to get lost anymore.
Molywood is the only two people who didn't shoot a fool on Sunday, but they also took the blog on Saturday mornings, Saturdays and back tomorrow mornings.
His long efforts, as well as seeing their energy rising from these proud viewers, seem to confirm that they are the players that need Sunday, and there will be no more interested players than Fleetwood or Molinari can defeat the European victory if the Le Golf National is on the sun.
If they're good at first, they're all the same but in each other's shoes.
However, Europe's victory is still too early to speak.
Bugba Watson and Webb Simpson are always late for Sergio Garcia, the king of fourballs, when Alex Noren is finished.
One blog and two doubles in front of the Izbek were exaggerating the Spanish and the Swedish and in the open pockets.
But on Sunday no one can hope to lure you away from worship.
It is very interesting to look at the furballs and foursomes close to cooperation between the two players, the advice he gives, the advice he gives without saying, and the possible changes of the procedure in the audience.
To date, the team of Europe has a good game and they have a great advantage when it comes to the last day but also seen in this game foursomes that the US team has the power to fight despite some of the concerns, including those in the United States.
Europe leads to the number 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a good chance of entering the final day of the fight against Ryder Cup when it won the US 10-6 after the Fourballs and Foursomes game.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, a co-founder of news, led by two victories in front of the difficult Tiger Woods, and increased its number to four in Le Golf National.
Never did the European team led by Thomas Bjorn, who intended to maintain their standard weight in Hazeltine two years ago, the American who had failed to clean up during fourballs in the morning, leading 3-1 in the race.
The Americans fought harder during the Foursomes, winning two games, but they failed to reduce their weight.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to hold on, he needs eight numbers during a 12-day private game.
Fleetwood was the first European girl to get four drawbacks, if she and Molinari were alone, the people called "Molliwood" after the last week of the surprise of many, the two people who had received four in the four-digit opening game in the history of Ryder Cup.
When they mounted Woods and Patrick Reed on the Fourballs, they led in a beautiful way to defeat the already dead Woods and the American girl Bryson Dechambeau at a more intense rate of 5&4.
Woods, who was very busy during the two games, seems to have been able to find out at times, but it has already played fourballs and 19 foursomes in 29 which he has been beaten and he has lost seven times.
When Justin Rose took his life for fourballs the next morning, he returned with Henrik Stanson during the foursomes and won 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – with the first and third world number.
Not all that Europe did was possible, although the day in the south of Paris was beautiful and full of flowers.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had already received the third major salary, set the target for the Americans on two Saturdays.
They were able to win the 2&1 battle in front of Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourballs and they returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy at 4&3 in foursomes despite losing the first two.
Twice in Ryder Cup's story, there were teams out of four numbers at the beginning of the private game, even though it was a game that seemed enough for Furyk's team to hold their ranks.
Although they kept the second place for two days, they did not seem to have the answers to the war on Sunday.
'Santria' in North Korea to destroy their own weapons without trust
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea told the United Nations that if the punishment continues, the United States will soon reduce its confidence in the United States and that it is the country that will agree to win its own nuclear weapons if that is the case.
It was said that North Korea has taken “a major measure of murder” in recent years, such as the halt of nuclear and missile fires, the destruction of nuclear testing sites, and the provision of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we can't see what his strategy is going on with it from the United States," he said.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't have any confidence in the protection of our country, so if that's the case, it's our only decision to destroy our first weapons."
Although North Korea's complaints about Washington's opposition have been repeated in Atoa Ri's way of "following" the process of producing nuclear weapons that are benefiting North Korea every step of the process, it seems strange to say that he no longer rejected the release of unmanned nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang did in the past.
The statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during his first high meeting with the US President-in-Office of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try to "send nuclear weapons to the Korean South," President Trump promised to secure the protection of North Korea.
North Korea sought an official way to end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang must agree to withdraw from the nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to accept the call to send a strong international picture of North Korea.
"The United States is still singing for the "pre-nuclear disarmament" and it is becoming more and more pressing the pressure of the sanctions to set its target in detention, as long as the "war's end" is against it," says Ri.
"The idea that the punishment will destroy us is a dream that people don't even know us.
The problem is just as the punishments continue to increase our mistrust."
Attoa Ri has never had a discussion about the second summit between Attoa Kim and Trump as the US President pointed out in front of the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
What the Minister said was the third meeting between Kim and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in in five months, and he added: "If South Korea is not talking about the construction of nuclear weapons in the United States, the production of nuclear weapons in Korea will not be like this."
However, it is quite different in his speech when compared to last year, when he said before the United Nations Congress that the US's sentence on fuses from North Korea was no longer possible after the "Brussels Day" called Kim's "homme-fusée" was called "homme-fusée".
While President Trump met with the United Nations this year, who warned North Korea "to be completely exonerated" last year, he commended Mr. Kim for our efforts to eliminate weapons, but he said that there was still much work to be done and that the punishment would not be withheld until the Koreans were released from their nuclear weapons.
The Tromp said last Wednesday that he has no clear date to do so, he said, "Maybe it takes two years, three or five months to do it – never mind."
China and Russia stated that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for its progress.
However, State Secretary Mike Pompeo to the United Nations Security Council said: "The application of the sanctions announced by the Security Council to our complete, complete, and can be confirmed by nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has been fully united with the increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 to try to increase funding for the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
During the United Nations Conference, he met at Atoa Ri Attoa Pompeo and then said he would visit Pyongyang again the upper month to prepare for his second meeting.
It's been three days since the Pompeo Bridge visited North Korea this year, but the last visit was not very successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July he said that the interview had progressed, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "a request similar to that of a youth."
When North Koreans met at Moon this month, they said they would destroy a Missile construction site and a nuclear storage facility if the United States took "a step against it."
He told him that his "compliant action" is the security security promised by Camp Trump in Singapore and that the relationship with Washington is going to be restored.
Students in Harvard learn a lot about a lot of freedom
In a new lesson presented to high school students at Harvard University this year, students increase their sleepiness in order to try to fight the culture of self-inflicted torture of the school’s “nighttime” at the café.
One researcher found that students at this world's highest university are often unaware of what is the most basic measure they should take for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created this lesson, which is probably not yet available in the United States.
She looked into creating the lesson after giving a speech on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
'After the talk, a girl approached and said, 'Why has anyone told me that in the third year?'
No one has ever told him how important the sleep is – and it is surprising to him,” he told The Telegraph.
In this lesson, which began this year recently, students are given a basic understanding of sleep habits that contribute to learning and exercise, and improve life in general.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Tale, director of the university's health office, said that the university decided to introduce the school when it found that students' sleep is not enough for the week.
The study lasted for an hour and contained a stirring discourse.
On the one hand, there is a photo of the student’s room, students need to print coffee coffee, coffee cupboards, trainers and books and inform them of the effects of caffeine, light and the effects of the lack of sleep on sports events, and finally, the frequency of sleep is important.
On the other hand, participants are told that it may lead to a decrease in blood pressure, a decrease in blood pressure, depression, and a reduction in blood pressure during the long term.
Then there is a picture of the classroom, a small icon with a link, which encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the student's way of life
But we believe that they have the right to know this – there is no other right to know the impact of smoking on health," Professor Czeisler continues.
The pride rate is still there when it becomes 'nightly sleepy', he says, adding that the result of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students has become a growing problem for the lack of sleep.
To make sure that the body is full of sleep, and good quality sleep, should be a 'secret weapon' that students should use to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – yes, even to prevent sleep, because the lack of sleep tells the brain that it is exhausted, only to stay alive.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old man from California who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler develop the lesson, as he had met with him for the first year in Harvard.
This lesson opened his eyes and encouraged him to do what he could to provide the lesson for a whole school.
He hopes that the next step is to throw out the fourth-year student because it is going up to launch a similar school program before entering the competition area.
If Professor Czeisler's proposal is to warn students about the hour of execution and the release, and to warn against the harmful effects of the electronic 'black iron' and LED wire, which may seriously damage the relationship between the body’s need for sleep and physical activity, it may cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gerrard's people are killed by Menga's ball
The Rangers were suffering from the lack of city control and the team of Steven Gerard who seemed unable to play too well in Livingston, the result of Dolly Menga's team.
The Ibrox team hoped that the first victory would take place outside the city from the great 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but the second defeat in the 18th game of the leader of the Ladbroke Premiership was given by the team Gary Holt.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the accident, and the Rangers team in the camp seemed unintended and did not expect to be released.
Rangers, Livingston, have now turned to poverty in the third place and Hibernian is the only one in front of the dead pool.
And the Rangers may not remain there after the damage to the head of Calum Spence, a player of the court, if something was taken out of the court and had to be treated first.
Gerard's eight shifts to his team, which cut through Ayr and included the half-way process for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt did not change the 11th Liverance from Hearts last week and he may have been happy to see his team that has been well-programming the opponents on every move.
The Rangers may often have bought the ball, but Livingston knew how to use the ball.
They should have killed a ball two minutes after the game started, as Menga made the first offer from her and saw Scott Pittman near Allan McGregor's pool, but the ball hit the middle of the stadium.
After that, Keaghan Jacobs dug a cup-franc away and saw Craig Halket's project but his friend Alan Lithgow's brother-in-law moved into a remote shelter.
The game is controlled only by Rangers but it seems to be much more than confidence in how they play in the last three hours.
Alfredo Morelos was very confident that he should get a penalty if he and Steven Lawless had argued in the fourteenth minute, but Judge Steven Thomson had just forced the Colombians to withdraw and his complaint.
There were only two cases of cancer from Rangers for the first time but there was no danger of questioning Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox nurse, who saw a gift from Lassana Coulibaly's mouth and an Ovie Ejaria relief.
It may be true that the first ball killed by Livi in 34 minutes is not a good game, but everyone agrees that it is worth it because of his creative ability.
The Rangers were no longer meeting Jacobs' heavy-duty game.
Scott Arfield did not act when Declan Gallagher offered Scott Robinson the ball, but then he did not hesitate to seek Menga, who killed the ball in a simple way.
Gerard made a slight change when he replaced Coulibaly, and nearly a handful of players came because Morelos was caught by the player in the street, but Kelly came running out of his spot and stopped him.
Livingston has continued to cut these foreign teams into his favorite game, so that Lithgow and Halket's departures did not stop.
Almost the Holt team has helped the number in the last minute but McGregor's stand was good enough to stop Jacobs, before a ball from the Lithgow's mouth was taken to avoid the noise of the storm.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers deputy, also asked for a penalty when he was out with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't even look at him.
Saturday: Geiger Counter's Creator · Global Voices
So once again, the page from our Saturday "Hans": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and MBOLA MITOHY... was born in Germany this day, and John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who later became a physical teacher.
Geiger developed a method of radioactivity testing and control, and later he produced the Geiger Counter device.
So far Geiger Counter has become a science-dependent tool, and then has become a pop-cholined tool, as seen in a 1950 film titled "Bells of Coronado", found by the unexpected Cowboys as scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter, used in the past to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you cover these hearings, you really miss the effects of radioactivity on the rock."
Evans says, "Oh, he's really busy!"
In 1945 "Hans" Geiger died, just a few days before his 63th year of life.
But there is still something created that bears his name.
His new box for healing may be able to teach the “see” protection force that the cell is sick.
His new box for healing may be able to teach the 'to see' protection force that the cells are sick and kill them.
In the medical process, this vaccine teaches the patient to identify the immune system.
In this way the cell cuts from the disease include a little change in the lungs.
They then ‘see’ a protein found in many types of fluids, then re-inserted in the body.
There was a vaccine that had a life-threatening effect on a number of patients with different diseases.
When a woman was treated with this vaccine, her vaccine teaches the ability to detect the disease cells, the pregnancy of her unborn child has disappeared in more than 18 months.
In the process, healthy cells are removed from the patient, changes in the lungs in order to "see" the protein called HER2 along with several remedies, and then cells are re-inserted into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "If we look at the results, this vaccine is very reliable."
HER2 is "ordered by the growth of many types of sanitation," including sleep deprivation, child homes, grasslands and grasslands, explains Professor Berzofsky.
There is a method similar to this health-care facility in the patient's "teached" to focus on the healing cells, which have been found in treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a long speech in support of Trump, and made MAGA fire, after he left at SNL.
It's a bad ending.
Viewer Kanye West was created in a video recording room during the Saturday Night Live program when he gave a long-standing speech to US President Donald Trump and said he would be elected in 2020.
After his third song for that night, taking the title Ghost Town, which he had played in a small press attack on Make America Great, he gave a long speech to criticize democracy and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to black people, and they say, "How do you love Trump, a man who's a boxer?"
If it's a problem for me, I've been out of America for a long time," he says.
At the beginning of the SNL program, there was a brief story of Matt Damon, who, at Hollywood's point of view, denied his stand as a witness to the House of Commons by Brett Kavanaugh in front of the House of Commons Law Committee, regarding the complaint by Christine Blasey Ford for a shameful move.
Even though it was not released during the program, the musician Chris Rock published the image file containing West's long speech on the social network.
It is not clear whether Rock's aim is to attract West when he posted that image file.
West also complained before the viewer that he was suffering from the heat he was suffering from behind the platform.
"They hurt me behind the curtain.
They say, 'Don't do that when you get out of the platform.'
They hurt me!
And they say I have a difficult place now," he says, according to the Washington Examiner report.
West kept saying, "You're going to find this difficult place?" he said, "I'm going to make Superman's passport, because that means you can't order what I do.
Try love."
At least two times, viewers corrected what they were saying and found that the SNL providers were ashamed, says the Variety report, and one said to the newspaper: "Because one house has not spoken."
West has been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, a former friend of the rap singer Mac Miller, a few days ago.
The way West sings the song I Love It, and dresss like the Perrier flag.
West received the support of TPUSA team leader Candace Turner, who said to Twitter: "For the most courageous person: DO NOT WALK THE WOMAN."
But Karen Hunter, a talent show provider, also told Twitter that "that he is the West is very nice to do."
"But I've chosen to support people (to buy their clothes or songs, or to support their "victuals") when I find myself talking and discussing, which I think, I'm ruining society.
He can do whatever he wants.
We too," he said.
The rapist, before the show, said on Twitter that he changed his name and "this is the official name Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name, but follows Diddy who is known as Puff Daddy, or Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapist, Snoop Dogg, once brought up the name Snoop Lion, and the famous artist Prince also changed his name to make him famous.
There was a target of killing people near the restaurant Belfast.
A man was arrested on the east side of the Belfast restaurant in the morning, and a 45-year-old man was sentenced to death.
That happened in the Ballyhackmore language, says the police.
The man will stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The public ministry will consider the matter.
Kit Harington, the famous actor of the Game of Thrones, in his game
Jon Snow is the best known figure in Kit Harington, where he uses a sword in the next Game of Thrones, a history of violence in the past.
The film player, aged 31, showed that even a violent person does not know how to do it, says that this is what makes young men think that they need violence and power to be respected.
Kit said on Sunday Times Culture that "there's something wrong with it", she asked herself how to help a man get away from the disturbing situation that had taken place during the #MeToo era.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, a woman playing with her in the 31-year-old Game of Thrones film. She said "will be willing" to help solve the problem.
‘I wonder why we have been misinformed about a man now?’ he said.
‘What did the boys teach when they grew up, causing this problem we see now?’
Kit believes that television is one of the reasons why people have the wrong view of men when they watch the role of men in movies.
And he added: ‘What are men like, and what have they been taught?
What is taught on television, and what do the street boys see that makes them think they have to do this if they want to become a real man?
Perhaps this is one of the most important questions we should answer: How can we change this?
But there's really a problem with men.'
He said in the survey that when the game of Throne is completed next year, he will no longer play to do his homework or add a little more, but he can say ‘war and conversation’.
Kit will start playing a new movie in November next month, Sam Shepard's True West, who talks about a man who is a movie producer and his brother who is a thief.
She said her meeting with her husband, Rose, was one of the best things she had to play with Game of Thrones.
‘This film was where I saw my husband, and that’s why I got a family and started my life,’ she said.
Rose, the woman who was interested in Kit when she played Jon Snow's part, played Ygritte's part during Emmy ard-winning.
They were married in the country of Leslie's family in Scotland this June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of people said to suffer from the disease in China
China said the HIV epidemic has increased by 14%.
More than 820,000 people are injured in the country, health officials say.
From May to July 2018 alone, it has been reported that it has killed 40,000 people.
Most of the disease has been transmitted because of sexual activity, but it has never been the same before.
Blood transfusions have contributed greatly to the disease in some parts of China, in the past.
However, there are almost no more people affected by the introduction of HIV, says health officials in China, at a meeting in Yunnan.
In the year, however, more than 100,000 people have been HIV and AIDS in China
The spread of HIV through sex is a major problem between men and women in China.
The cars of both men and women in China have also been legally accepted since 1997, but people are still very different.
Because of the culture in the country, a survey of 70 to 90 percent of men having sex with men found that only women are married.
It is not enough to protect their sex, which is why the disease spreads.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has accepted the use of HIV from abroad to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP employee has not issued the senator's secret and says there are "a real threat lier" to "one project"
American Maxine Waters, said on Saturday that some of her employees were justified and said they had issued the U.S. secretary's signature on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles also stress that the secret was issued by right-wing and web users who reject the idea of "the last right-hand".
"It's the most terrible lie, lies and lies," Waters said, in what was shared on Twitter.
Private addresses and telephone numbers in the United States are said to include such items as Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
These details were posted on the Internet on Thursday, and the person who sent them was unknown. However, it was known that this occurred during a senatorial meeting in Capitol Hill, where a joint complaint about Brett Kavanaugh's behaviour was announced, which was brought to the Supreme Court.
The brief explanations were published after the three senators examined Kavanaugh.
Such websites as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP address sent the message was from the Waters office, and published information about the Water staff, says The Hill.
"There is no evidence and it's completely false," said Waters.
"The people who work with me - who have hidden their identity after these patterns - have never published an explanation.
There is no evidence and it's completely false."
What he said on the Internet has made people more critical of Waters than Maison Blanche journalist and Fleischer.
"He's worried about his departure," Fleischer said.
"It is clear that he does not have the qualities necessary to be a member of Congress.
A person should not be angry if he is justified but has not done so.
They should not be jealous.
He should not worry about the reasons why the person has made it look like him.
It should be dignified and peaceful."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of democracy about the Kavanaugh case, and the criticism he received because he was very angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a electorate from the Republican party, also commented on Twitter, which aims to gather Waters' place in the elections.
"It's really important if it's true," he said
Rtoa Waters said his office announced "the authorities and the authorities who regulate the implementation of the laws because of these sanctions."
"We are doing what we can to see the kidnappers," he said, "and they will be punished by law for the dangers they have spread about the people who work with me."
Johnny English came back – a funny film by actor Rowan Atkinson
People have become accustomed to thinking that they have a back-up idea that always shows Brexit which has an English player, and that's what happened to Johnny English- who first appeared in 2003, took his title, Johnny English, and his post that came out in 2011 with his title, Johnny English Reborn.
Will we laugh alone if people really do us and they dare to move?
Anyway, we know that Johnny English has renewed his engagement to do the job, which is a funny and funny movie for English-speaking people.
He's an unscientific musician, and he thinks he's very beautiful, but he's only going to be with Clouseau, and there's some part to see his name Mr. Bean.
The role of this player was taken as from the film about Atkinson, which is a world-wide player. The film was sent to Barclaycards TV, but is now unknown to people.
There's one or two nice things about this JE to come out soon.
I want to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter and wearing an old military suit, and the thing about the helicopter is going to be on its own defense.
Even though Atkinson's appearance is funny, it's not funny and it's just like the film was just forced to make fun, even though it's really fun in such "solid" movies as 007 and the Mission impossible.
It's like it's done to make fun of children rather than adults. I think it's not much better than the funny movie she did as Bean she was.
But when the situation is looked at, Great Britain has a serious problem.
There are netizens who used people to see the British network, knowing who the British spy was, who disappointed the police at the time – a small part played by Kevin Eldon.
This led a lot of history to the prime minister who knew a lot of problems, but no longer supported. Emma Thompson tried to do what she could when Teresa May played, but nothing had been played.
His advisers informed him that all of them had been aware of their actors, so he had to go to the theater no longer worked.
So it was done to glorify Johnny English, who became a teacher in a school for money, and to train him to become a poet: a funny story, because English made him like a school of intellectuals.
English was once taken to Whitehall and saw old friends, Bugh, the role played by Ben Miller.
Bugh has already married and works for people on the sea, a woman who shows respect: part played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are going back to work, and they will do things that are wrong when the Girl Scouts are upset, and they will meet with Ophelia Bulletova, the game of Olga Kuryrenko, who is a beautiful and powerful girl.
In the meantime, however, the prime minister was attacked when a man who grew rich and was able to address the problem about the Internet player. It was not Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bugh began their journey. They built a restaurant in the hotel and drank French hotels. They found problems when they went to the Volta camp. And English led problems when they learned to use cassettes that gave her a mental image of Volta's house.
We will still see in the next half of the story. Although it is fun and fun, there are television programs for children to do so.
For the first time in history, it has been called.
When I saw this film, Johnny English, I thought, "Atkinson should be part of an English film when he's playing it.
The workers refused to set up a war party to join the British four days a week but to get a five-day crew.
Jeremy Corbyn's party plans to implement the project to make Britain work for four days a week but takes five days' wages.
The union said that employers should transfer the money they have been saved for technology development by giving them no extra days.
It'll give you three days without work at the end of the week but it's Sunday.
The source says that the idea will be consistent with the work of the union in order to give workers more advantage.
The Congress of Trade Unions agreed to allow workers to work only four days a week so that they can benefit from economic change.
A longtime member of The Sunday Times' Trade Union said: "The announcement of new governance is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be applicable to night workers but the requirement may be appropriate, whether it is four days a week, to include a trade union on economic conditions and to give benefits to workers and industrial strategies in a unique way."
Not only did the Workers' Union have this idea, but the Black Party also promised that it would work only four days a week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the request has not yet been submitted by the Workers' Union.
One employee's representative said: "It's not a single management procedure that works only four days a week and that's not really examined by the union."
Chancellor John McDonnell launched a conference on work last week to explain how he saw the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he's willing to join forces with "indirect sales" and "excellent profits" in small companies.
The Chancellaire project also means that the co-operatives of water companies may not be able to recover all the money they have spent because the State can reduce the cost of the land if there is only a small amount of unfair action.
He also set up a plan to set up a clear location for the company's employees and to buy a Full Fund for the founder to give equal government to 10 percent of the company's employees, which includes more than 500 euros in cash.
"60 minutes" says Lindsey Graham, and John Kennedy to be able to change the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh
At least a week, the last election on the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the FBI's investigation of his charges, asked whether what the office saw might move the Republican senators to stop supporting him.
In a survey on Sunday, "60 minutes", journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could do to change their mind.
Kennedy spoke more about his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course it is," I mean Kennedy.
"I will come from the court," I said to him, talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, and the announcement came out, and I said, ‘ Did I do that?’
He's determined, ready, not guilty."
But Graham's choice was not compromised.
"I don't think it's going to change my mind if Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to be with heavy charges," he says.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I know is, "It was rejected by the coastal Bret," Graham helped, talking to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he named were unable to prove that.
36 years ago.
I can't see the news and the changes."
What is the Civil War, and what has been the result of the Poverty Reduction?
Next Saturday, New York will take the Public Day, an annual music event that will find many artists to play and play; to reduce world poverty.
In his seven years, the National Council will find more than ten people in Central Park's stadium, not only to enjoy a show like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to compete for the real-purpose movement to improve the poverty in 2030.
The Civil War, in 2012, is an extension of the International Conference on Poverty, an international debate that is expected to end poverty by increasing the number of people involved in the war.
To get the free package to attend the event (if you don't want to buy a VIP package), viewers need to do a lot of things, or work as a volunteer, informing world leaders, performing telephone calls or other ways to help the campaign on their goal is the fight against poverty.
But why has the success of the world's citizens in the 12 years to achieve their goals?
Is it really a good way to give people a free package to convince them to support the call for the movement, or just the call "clictivism" - people feel the difference when they write names for online requests and just send a call?
Since 2011, citizens have said that it has already registered some 19 million of its supporters, which has prompted them to move forward to another goal.
These work has been said to have helped many world leaders to agree and raise nearly $37 million in order to save the lives of more than 2.25 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 agreements and declarations, showing the results of their work, at least $10 billion had already gone and returned.
The group concluded that the financial aid had a direct impact on some 649 million people around the world.
The Power of Nutrition, among other things, agreed to work together with English money providers and executives to "help children grow up legally", and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help fight malnutrition when more than 4700 citizens received a voice of acceptance.
"With the support of the English government, volunteers, the government, and people like you, we will be able to put "the suffering resulting from malnutrition" as a sign of the rest of the historical page, says The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulman to the people during his show in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 U.K. efforts to improve food for mothers and children, the government said it would provide money for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which would help many to provide food to mothers and children around 5 million.
The question on his website will be answered, "Why do you believe we can keep the worst poverty?"
Most citizens replied: This is going to be difficult and difficult - we may sometimes fall, we may not succeed.
However, like ethnic and anti-crime conflicts, we will win because we will be stronger if we join together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, is one of the participants in this year's event in New York, which Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman hosted.
The United States has been able to use the marine army as a “dangerous” in order not to be able to transport energy - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington can call on the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from spreading in the market, including in the Middle East, said US Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington's Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's agreement with Syria - as noted, which took place at the invitation of the legal governments - is just a way to bring about a new energy market.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to waste energy just as they did in Europe, the wealth of southern Europe," he said.
And, as the honourable man said, there is a solution to how and how this can be done.
"The U.S., with the Navy, can prove that maritime travel is open and even if it is necessary to fight it so that their energy is not available to the market," he says.
Zinke invited the participants who were invited by the Organisation of Energy Buyers, an independent organization that holds the "sound of Energy Buyers".
She went to compare Washington's design with her relationship with Russia and Iran, and noted that she was the same as both if it were true.
"The economic option, either Iran or Russia, is likely, with financial support and oil spills, he says, and compared Russia to a "a low-carbon oil fuel."
The announcement came when Trump's delegation was still busy contributing to natural gas transfers in Europe, to replace Russia, with a greater challenge for European buyers.
Most importantly, President Donald Trump himself won Germany's confidence that the authorities in Trump's regime, including President Trump, would withdraw from the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the capital of Moscow."
Moscow has confirmed that North Stream's 2-billion-dollar shots, designed to increase twice as high as 110 billion cubic meters, are a clean economic project.
The Kremlin explained that Washington’s ongoing opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and sets a bad example in the struggle against injustice.
"I believe that we all agree that energy should not be a pressure-pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose who they like," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with the American Energy Management Secretariat in Moscow in September.
The U.S. handcuffs have caused Germany to return and strengthen its commitment to join the project.
The leader of the German industrial organizations, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the Americans not to restrict the energy and two agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a major problem when a third state was involved in powering us," said Dieter Kempp, president of the Federation on German Industry (BDI) after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren in 2020 says Massachusetts's Senate's Senate will focus on the move as president.
Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's senator said that he would "focus on the move to the next election."
At a meeting in Holyoke Massachusetts, Warren spoke about his needs.
"Now is the time for women to go to Washington and save our government and include women to be in the gang, says The Hill report.
"I will look closely at the presidential election, after November 6th."
Warren even chased Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall and said that his country was "in the wrong way.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump will do about our democracy.
Warren is already well known for accusing Trump and the politician of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In response to a call on Friday, Warren said "be careful that we need the FBI's investigation before the elections."
However, a survey conducted on Thursday showed that most members of Warren refused to leave in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the "secure" voters from Massachusetts said that the Senate should not run, according to the Political Research Centre at Suffolk/ Boston Globe poll University.
Two-thirds of them agree to their request.
The survey showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick supported much, supporting him in the 38 percent and 48 percent of the non-supported competition.
Many other democratic dignitaries have argued that it is possible to compete in 2020, including Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make his decision public in January as reported by the Journalists' Association.
Sarah Palin talks about track Palin's fate during Donald Trump's public rally
Track Palin, 26 years old, went to Iraq for a year after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with committing crimes in the homes on Monday night.
"All that my child has lost, he will be able to laugh again, I can tell about the families who remember the pain of suffering and some of the wounds of our soldiers returned from the war," he told the audience during the Tromp's campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "elfant in the room" and said about his children and many foreign patients "they have changed little from there, become very hard, and ask themselves if they have respect for their friends and air carriers, and other members of the army, the country has been given."
On Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, a woman was charged with sexual violence with weapons and drugs, as reported by Dan Bennett, the spokesman of the police department in Wasilla.
18 D.C. support for the elimination of new asylum policies
The 18-year-old state and Colombia's district require legal protection for a new American national policy denying asylum for victims of violence or domestic violence.
The representative of 18 countries and the districts requested the presidential summit in Washington to support political asylum seekers, according to the NBC News report.
The full name of the striker at Grace v. The American ruling on American social freedom on federal policy has not been declared.
Women reported that people with her and her children, who were members of the rapist, killed her but the U.S. government rejected her request to pass on 20 July.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Grace's lawyers made it clear that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which makes American asylum seekers, like a country facing serious problems with domestic offenders and violence.
American news policy has eliminated the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers that it adopted in 2014 that illegal immigrants have been able to escape domestic violence in order to implement asylum.
Colombia's district, law lawyer Karl Racine said in the Zuma statement that the new policy "is not known for the decades of state, federal and international rights."
"The federal law requires that all courts should be consistent with the facts and circumstances, and the system that contradicts this format," the prosecutor said.
Lawyers have found that immigration policies undermine American economics, stating that they may become businessmen and "help with physical work."
Lawyer Jeff Sessions has appointed a refugee representative to stop supporting victims of domestic violence and related violence in June.
"Assala is now available to those who have left their country because of persecution or fear because of racial, religious, national, or political differences," the secretary said in a statement on June 11 on politics.
The place of execution – even the major problems – which people all over the world face is not meant to end.
The immediate rescue effort in Palu would be disappointing if the deaths were twice as high as they were trying to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has deteriorated.
"Very hard,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who comforted her daughter when she was born in a log cabin in the city of Palu.
"There's always a sick car coming every minute, reporting death.
there is no clean water."
The residents returned to their bazaars, took the baths, took what could be taken.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital was hit by 7.5 earthquakes.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who cut wood and flour, stayed in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated with severe diseases outside the hospital.
He was blind when he told of the terrible earthquake that swept the fifth floor where he had his wife and his daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I thought I couldn't move on the wall," said Haris in a gathering video, he went to the villa to save his family's marriage
"I heard my husband calling for a moment, but suddenly I fell asleep.
I didn’t know what was happening to him and my son.
May they not die."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of "inflicted" with "a campaign"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper, they published four pages of paper on an American newspaper expressing the US's commercial benefits, accusing the US Embassy of China in Beijing of using the US press to promote ideas.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump - the most famous newspaper in Iowa - spoke about China's daily support in the Mones Register - when he accused China of wanting to join the Congress elections on November 6.
The Tromp's claim that Beijing has blocked the US election notes what the US authorities have said to Reuters: a new step in the development of Washington's campaign to force China.
Although foreign governments are common to place marketing documents to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting trade in the same rights of transfer.
China's campaign at the beginning of the war was designed to attack such countries as Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American scientists say.
Terry Branstad, former U.S. ambassador to China and former government in Iowa, a major company on the effects of Chinese agriculture, said Beijing had been injured by workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
In an article published in the newspaper Des Moines on Sunday, Branstad wrote to China: "The threat is now increasing twofold by advertising on free news.
"By launching its campaign, the Chinese government uses the popular tradition for freedom of speech and freedom of the media through the Des Moines list," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, in Beijing's newspaper, you will find the number of unbounded opponents and you will not find a reliable attitude similar to that of the Chinese people about the economic crisis in China, to be severely controlled. The Chinese Communist Party, as it is written, "
She also said that "one of the most popular newspapers in China has rejected the post's release, even though she did not say the newspaper directly.
Analysts warned the refugee Republic against voters nine years ago with the Kavanaugh incident
Many Republicans support and protect electoral agents to the Britt Kavanaugh tribunal, in front of a number of reports of sexual violence, one researcher warned that they would show a stronger attitude, especially for women, during the upcoming elections.
The outcome of this situation is very strong and most of the Republicans have already declared that they want to vote later.
Grant Reeher, a political science teacher at the Maxwell School, University of Syracuse, gave a post published on Saturday.
Reeher suspects that the voter's efforts by Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will slow down in the last minute for the FBI investigation
"The women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and even November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the mayor and spokesman of the country's MoveOn, according to news agency Washington, DC
The next morning, protestors protested, "The November will come!" as they pointed out in the law of the National Assembly when the Republic of Kavanaugh decided to appoint the judicial committee, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The ambitions of democracy and the reasons for the movement of democracy will not be included in the bill," said Stu Rothenberg, a political researcher who has no support for the media.
"People say it's growing; and it's true.
But it may be even higher, especially for rural voters and 18-to-29-year-old voters, although the president does not like them, they often do not.
Even before Ford's testimony against the High Court's candidate for sexual abuse, the prosecutor announced that the answer would appear if the Republic continued with the consolidation.
"It took a lot of tension for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the National Committee of the Former Republic, earlier this week, according to the NBC News.
"Not only the election of the committee or the last election, nor the establishment of Kavanaugh, but also the way the Republicans did and how they did it, "Guy Cecil, president of the USA, a group of democratics elected, said on television.
However, the Americans seem to share two things about who should be a witness but Ford is more religious than Kavanaugh.
The YouGov survey found that 41% of the respondents believed in the Ford testimony completely or did not believe, while 35% said that Kavanaugh did not believe.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied as a witness, 30% said Ford was the same.
After Flake's release, the FBI is investigating Ford's charges and other prosecutors, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford stood up as a witness before the Senate Justice Committee during his speech last week that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17.
Ramirez announced that the Supreme Court's candidate showed his skills during his party's studies in Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web creator plans to create a new Internet used on Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, has launched a campaign against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the most recent project on technology is an open-source company of Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows its user to choose the location where the archived file is located and who can access the information.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "Inrupt" is the goal of "inrupt".
"We must do this now," he said to the new company.
"This is a unique opportunity."
The program uses advanced technology to enable people to create "special tools on the Internet" or POD for themselves.
There may be a list of connectors, a list of things done, albums, music lists and other special tools and skills.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, there are only one "navigator" and at the same time.
What distinguishes the private web site is the user's access to the type of source.
The company's aim is "to give special attention by means of data."
According to general director of the company John Bruce, the goal of Inrupt is to provide the source of power, expertise and expertise to make it possible for all.
The company is currently the Berners-Lee company, Bruce, in a security area purchased by IBM, has been contacted by entrepreneurs to work on projects and volunteer society.
Since this week, technology users around the world can create applications for themselves using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking about "Facebook and Google" to make a complete change that will completely change the model of his sales here.
"We do not ask permission from them."
In an article on Media released this Saturday, Berners-Lee said that "the voluntary move is to provide economic and environmental energy to protect the dignity and quality of the new news sites."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has participated in the debate on the absence of the Internet.
Despite the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, building the website and Open Data Institute.
"I am looking forward to this new time of the site," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria's Square Celebrates the First Great War · Global Voices
The only religious leader in the Church of England won Victoria's second degree during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in the city of her birth 100 years later.
Colonel Lyton The Reverend Bernard Vann won a prize on September 29, 1918 against Bellenglesle and Lehacourt.
She didn't even know she had a reputation from the English army but was killed four days later by a skilled shooter.
Two of her daughters showed a piece of paper during the storm, in Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his daughters, said that he "had a great idea of history" why the wall was displayed 100 years after the war that his father knew very well.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his army to the canal Saint-Quentin, in the "flamming fire and shooting around the battlefield", on September 29, 1918.
Then he used to go to the shooting site, and in "the most special and respectful way" he led his group to the front, and then he himself shot and killed three of his enemies.
A German professional bomber killed Colonel Vann on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his father “will never be able to imitate” what he did, causing him to be“ proud. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also brought honor to himself after the death, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he's "will be happy to take part in the summit," and he also said that "one's heart is strong if there's a lot of supporters."
MMA's supporters called to see Bellator 206; but Peppa Pig appeared again
Imagine that you were dreaming and enjoyed watching Bellator 206, but then you didn't let the program take a look at what was really interesting.
There were 13 conflicts in San Jose's schedule, and six of them were very interesting, and were sent all night to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But at six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, all British observers were alarmed and surprised because the program became Peppa Pig immediately.
Some are surprised because they've been preaching just to watch the competition.
One viewer said on Twitter that the film was “unsatisfied” for children.
"In accordance with state law, the program is not supposed to be launched at 6:00 a.m. The program must be replaced for children," says Dave Schwartz, president of Bellator's sales and communications organization.
"Peppa the Pig," ie."
Bellator's president, Scott Cooker, said he would search for British viewers when he made the next schedule.
Coker said he "thinks he's going to send it back," and "seek a solution."
"But the day is already six o'clock in the morning, so we can't solve the problem without Sunday, at our own time.
But we are looking for solutions.
We feel that there are so many shared messages, and most of those who wrote them are not happy.
Now we're trying to solve the problem. We thought it was a technical problem,
That's not the case with the king.
We hope that the following examples will no longer happen.
We're going to reduce the number of competitions, but it's not going to be six anymore, for example, but we're trying to make the viewer happy, and it's getting worse.
It is also very sad."
Desert Island: Tom Daley thought himself "lower" than others
The Olympic poet Tom Daley said that he felt "lower" than others when he was sober, because he loved men, but that made him determined to succeed.
The young man who was 24 years old said he had been in high school before he heard that "there was no one like him."
He commented on the program presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4 Desert, saying that people who love men or women also have rights, and he wants to give others a "hope".
He also said that when he was a child, it was no longer important for him to win the Olympics.
The program provider, Kirsty Young, has been unemployed for months because of illness.
As if Daley was a seaman in his first program with Laverne, he said he felt "lower" compared to others when he grew up because "the society did not accept that this was a man who loved men, women who loved women."
He said: “I have always felt inferior to others, but it gives me strength today and gives me a sense of success."
He wants to show people that he's "doing things", so people won't be very disappointed when they know he loves men.
She received two medals and wanted to support the LGBT. She showed up in front of many people during the game of the Commonwealth in Australia this year, and used to announce that all countries should be free and not ban the presence of LGBT.
She said she accepted a speech because she knew she was successful, and she was not accused of being allowed to join a man freely, so she wanted to give others a "hope".
The one who received the world's three grandparents said he was a man, not the American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013. "I didn't expect."
Daley married Oscar at the age of 20, which is not a problem, she says, the difference of the year.
"When you're going through a variety of things when you're young - she took part in the first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and her father was killed three years later — it's hard to see someone like you who was affected by the same thing that you got."
He had two children in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said he changed his "how he thinks and sees things."
“If I asked you a question last year, I would say, “I can get a gold medal,” he said.
"But you see, there is something more important than gold medals.
Robbie's a gold medal."
Her son bears the name of his father. He died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Daley said his father never agreed to his death, and the last thing he asked was to get a ticket for London in 2012 because he wanted to sit on the first line to see his son.
I couldn't say to him: "You won't look at me first."
"I held his hand when he was gone. When he was dead and I thought he might be dead," she said.
The following year, in 2012, Daley took part in the Olympic Games and won the medal.
"That's what I've dreamed of since I was a little boy, that I'm going to dance in front of a lot of people in the Olympics. I'm so happy."
It also inspired him when he chose his song – Proud de Heather Small – which gave him strength during the preparation of the Olympics. He was still very scared.
You will remember the Desert Island Discs on Sunday at 11:15 BST on Radio BBC.
Mickelson was not allowed to participate in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will try to find the best he can do on Sunday, when he plays the 47th game on Ryder Cup, but he has to try to figure out what he's done so that it doesn't make him very sad for him.
Mickelson participated in the event every 12 years, but Captain Jim Furyk was fired by the four volleyballs on Saturday.
Although many should focus on him, as in the United States, he went with the pump-pom girl for a whole day, and tried to correct his mistake.
It's not easy to lead, even though it's very popular. He's 48 years old but he's not allowed to play the Golf National, because if it's not possible to launch the ball, it's completely lost.
Although the place is difficult to play, it will compete with the famous British, Francesco Molinari in the enemy game he will play on Sunday, which was with the team of the fourth winner this week, who was not Tommy Fleetwood.
This game will be very important for Mitchell, especially if he is trying hard to start, as the American team has already lost four in the 12 simple games.
Furyk said that his players were so confident that he would not speak too much.
"He well knows what he's going to do today. He pushed my shirt a little, he picked me up and said he was ready for the game tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's really confident.
He was one of the most famous players in the Temple, and he has been helping his team ever since this week.
I didn’t think he would play again.
But I hoped he'd play more than that, but we believe that's what we're supposed to do.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will get more marks than Nick Faldo at Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may be the last time he plays with Ryder Cup, which will get the most significant character in all games he has ever played.
Mickelson, a 20-year-old survivor and received 7 times, although Furyk said that his arrival had caused the team to lose its momentum.
"He smiles even though he's smiling, he's very smart, he likes to laugh, he likes to have him in the team," she says.
"I think he's happy with the young in the team this week, and it was wonderful to see that.
He's not just playing but really giving."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that they might lose.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that even though they are leading a little ahead of the two-player match games on the last day of Ryder Cup, they can easily turn to singing.
The Danoa was the first to play in Valderrama in 1997. The team of Seve Ballesteros then received five tops of the American team, but it was just in the middle. They won 141⁄2-13 1⁄2
"Keep in mind that we led to Valderrama, we led to Brooklyn, which we defeated, and to Valderrama which we won, but now," Bjorn said, in a photo, after watching the 2018 Class received 5-3 marks in the morning and evening, leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story of me and everyone on the team will show that it's not possible.
In the morning, you do your best.
Go up to the platform and do everything you can.
It's still not possible that we're still looking for a sign on the table.
This is our goal: to get the start, that's what we focus on.
I have always said from the very first time that 12 players are my main focus, but we also know that we are among the most experienced in the world."
Bjorn enjoyed his players' playing in the troubled golf field, and he added: "I should not think I'm familiar with this.
I don't want to see what tomorrow will bring.
In the morning, each of us could play it out, and it became something else.
It's nice to play together when things are going well, but when you're working alone, you're actually seeing your ability to play golf.
This is the message you need to send to players, to give your best tomorrow.
Don't think about your friend, but let him give her the best of it."
But Furyk was not like Bjorn, because he wanted each one of them to try to give the best of it, just like they did when they were with his friends. But Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, because he got three in four games.
Furyk was always at the end of the big days of special and varied events, from the winning team in Brooklyn before Europe rejected the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember all the openings in it," he explained how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, played the final day of the game.
"There are 12 big games tomorrow, but you should be ready immediately to start making a big start for you to see in Brooklyn, for you to see in Medinah.
It's a trick, when it comes to one another, puts a lot of pressure on the games he hopes to play.
And we're going after that and we're wearing all the clothes we like, you see, we're doing great things tomorrow.
Thomas tried to lead the match against Rory McCllroy in the most violent game, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, European members of his organization.
"I chose this group next to this order because I think it is possible to do this to the end," Bjorn explained his choice for two players' games.
The arrival of German new warships has been delayed
The new German army vessel should have arrived in 2014 to launch the battleship in the days of the Cold War, but it will not have been there for at least a year for reasons of construction and for the increase in prices according to media reports.
Using "Rheinland-Pfalz," the arrival of the lead ship in the Baden-Wuertemberg class as explained by military spokesman Die Zeit.
The ship should have been used in the marine army in 2014, but the problem with its transport has affected the plan of work that had been completed.
The four vessels that were repatriated to Baden-Wuertemberg in 2007 will replace the Bremen vessels that are already on board.
Of course, they will put a heavy load of horses, a variety of aircraft fighters, ships and technics, such as a small hidden radio, with a special sound and signal.
While he is still a member of the specialist era, it may be possible to consider issuing these new ships in the workshop for two years.
However, the continued delay means that the final landing vessels are expected to see Germany's strength on the shore again will be worth the day before it is used, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 vessel became newsable every year when the German Navy officially refused to use it and returned it to the port of Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
First of all, the marine army returned the ship to its manufacturer.
It is not very clear why he was restored, but German media said that "no social and physical integrity" did not allow the ship to use the ship in the course of a peace movement.
The lack of information is a major problem because 120 ships will lead the Baden-Wuertemberg fleets of less than one of the people who brought the former Bremen vessel.
In addition, it is clear that the ship was heavily loaded and reduced its speed and was limited by the specific changes made by the marine forces.
It is believed that the 7,000-year-old "Rheinland-Pfalz" was twice as heavy as the same ship that Germany used in the Second Great War.
In addition to the lack of physical integrity, the cost of a whole project has also become a problem, including the training of farmers in its rule.
It was estimated that up to 3.1 billion euros (or 3.6 billion dollars) would be worth 2.2 billion euros for the first time.
The problems encountered by the newest ships have become particularly significant as a recent warning that Germany's sea force is sinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the ship is "no longer empty and full of ships."
The honourable man said that the problem was growing rapidly because the former vessels were no longer used but had not yet been given a new ship to replace them.
He even complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg ships could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Knows the Secret of Family Life · Global Voices
A new research conducted in the northernmost part of Scotland has been found on the way in which the mother is feeding on the urban landscape.
It is hoped that the only believing animal’s life - style will be better explained, but the research will turn around and will help those who may be in a position to protect the future.
Research by scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will focus on the visible "pipistrelles" and "soprano", also on the dark days of the school’s volleyballs and the Daubentons of Inverwe Gardens, West Ross.
A special person will be sent to the site to record the actions and lives of relatives during the specified period.
Several NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct a free investigation using local surveys.
Experts will then use the available records, including a friend's call and what he or she does or what he does.
Then there will be pictures of the homes of relatives and reports to be made so that they can create pictures of how they react in rural areas.
Rob Dewar, a NTSC consultant and naturalist, hopes that the research answers will find out what kind of place the relatives really need and how they live in each other's lives.
This will help you to know the benefits of managing the habitats of these animals, such as the creation of a nest and how to maintain as much forest as possible for their ancestors and similar animals.
It appears that the brothers in Scotland and throughout Great Britain have been very prejudiced over the centuries.
Large buildings and types of development work that damage their neighborhood and their communities are dangerous to them.
However, lighting and power-saving machines can also be dangerous, such as paper and other chemical materials used in building tools, and the packaging material that can be captured.
However, it is not a sign of weakness.
However, because he is an animal of prey at night, his shoes work better than his eyes when he captures his teeth.
He uses many simple techniques and me to see clearly the insects he is dealing with and the problems that may affect him in the dark.
The NTS, which manages over 270 historic buildings, is a very needed garden 38 and in 76,000 hectares across the country, is fully committed to the planning of the uncle.
He has ten skilled workers, regularly doing research, watching and sometimes even saving.
Scotland has even made its headland in the Dumfries and Galloway, a home of eight tenths of Scotland.
David Thompson, the director of the country, said that there was a real place for them.
"We have a place for our friends here in Treve as he says.
"We have many houses, many trees that have existed for a long time and a place to live.
But there are still many things that we do not know about our ancestors, so our work here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what they really need in order to increase them quickly."
He stressed the importance of monitoring the mother’s mother before taking care of her child in these places because the risk of harming only one child’s life is likely to kill up to 400 female relatives, and the whole community can be wiped out.
The mother is protected and the law prohibits killing her, tortures her or seduces her or damages her neighbour.
Elizabeth Farrell, appointed Special Representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, urged the public to hand it over.
He said: “We still have much to learn about our ancestors and, for most of the species we have, we don't just know what kind of group they are."
Ronaldo rejected his accusations and decided to witness to a German newspaper
Cristian Ronaldo insisted that the charges against him were "inaccurate news", and that they said they were "to know people," using his name.
The lawyer quoted German journalist Der Spiegel who published the charge.
Portugal's player and Juventus were charged with removing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga from a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It has been said that she told the woman $375 000 after not to tell the story, as Der Spiegel said in the morning.
Kristian Ronaldo, 33 years old, spoke directly with the Instagram video to more than 142 million fans and followers after the complaint was released, reversing that it was “inaccurate news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, a lie news, "says the winner who won his gold medal and turned to the photographer.
"They want to know people, they use my name.
That's legal.
They want to say my name, but it is part of the work.
I'm very happy and not worried," said the player, and he laughed.
Ronaldo's spokesman was prepared to accuse Der Spiegel of the false charge, they called it “an inadmissibility and personal concern” according to Reuters report.
Lawyer Christian Scherts said he should be asked for a bribe because of the “distortion of the event and its consequences” which is likely to be among the violations of one's rights, most important of the time."
It was said that it happened at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting them at a concert hall, it is reported, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he was taken to his chair, according to a notice letter placed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga then said that Ronaldo was shocked after the incident and told him that he could be described as a good person "99 percent" but the "one hundred".
The report said Ronaldo agreed that they had sex but agreed."
Mayorga also said she went to the police and had a picture of the injuries she had suffered in the hospital, but later she agreed not to raise the case because "she was afraid that the case would be based on her again" and thought that she might be "free of charge."
The 34-year-old woman just said she's going back to the case and she's still terrified of what happened.
Ronaldo was on the line to save Real Madrid from Manchester United by the time the charges were filed, and moved to the capitals of Juve Italy after the 100 million euros agreement last year.
Brexit: 'Foreign' is Britain's dream of car manufacturers · Global Voices
"It will be a real experience for Britain to lose its place in the production of cars all over the world after its departure," said Secretary Greg Clark.
As for Toyota, he added, Great Britain at BBC said that if he departs from the European Group without a measure, the production in Burnaston, near Derby, could take a long time.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The manufacturer of a Japanese car said that the impact of the damage on the country's borders due to a lack of restraint by Britain could result in a lot of work.
The Burnaston factory that Auris and Avenis of Toyota can produce about 150,000 cars a year, 90% of which have been transferred to the European Union's member countries.
"As far as I can see, if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March we will find that production will stop in our village," says Marvin Cooke, head of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers for Britain expressed concern about their departure from the European Union, there is no agreement on how to carry out trade negotiations, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar and Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said that he would close his factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car drivers say about the possibility of being in a certificate room resulting from Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production method is based on "time," with a peak coming every 37 minutes from the UK and the European Group for cars only.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union on March 29th, there may be an earthquake on the ground that can cause noise and lack of assistance from people on this work.
Toyota will not be able to stay for more than one more day to watch in his Derby factory, says the company's manager, so the production needs to be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's communication plan for the European Group is "a clear sign to prevent earthquakes on the border."
"We need to make an agreement We want to set the most appropriate measure, not just to live the success of the moment, as I have already said, so that we can use this event to benefit us, he says on a program on the 4 BBC radio today.
"Toyota is still the only evidence that there are other producers that we still need to continue the way in which we work together that has brought great success."
The Toyota company can't say that production will be slow, but it said that it will be a problem to endure, because it will reduce competition with other companies and cause unemployment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a worker in Burnaston for 24 years and a member of the Society's meeting manager at the production house, said that his members were deeply affected "Because of the efforts I have seen he has just finished these jobs and will no longer return.
The government spokesman also said: "We should put in place a plan for the future of the European Union's relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed by saying "Maison Blanche."
The meeting that can be very famous for Donald Trump and the temporary president of the Roseenstein Supreme Court is "not to be moved again one week" because the war with Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court continues on Sunday, said Maison Blanche.
Roseinsten closely monitors the work of private spokesman Robert Muelle, who is the last to conduct an investigation on the electoral crisis in Russia, the connection between the assistance of Trump and Russia and the possible threat of the court.
Whether it is or not, Trump has given the temporary president of the Supreme Court, and Mueller will no longer be able to leave, as Washington's funeral has been published for months.
Rosenstein said he would hear his talk with Trump and talk about the possibility of withdrawing the president by law 25, says the New York Times report earlier this month.
Roseinstein rejected the report.
However, on Monday he went to Maison Blanche, and another report was filed that he was about to leave.
But there was a meeting with Trump in the United Nations in New York, as announced on Thursday.
Trump said he should not remove Rosenstein but the beginning of the meeting was delayed in order to prevent an accident during the hearing of the Senate Committee of Kavanaugh and a woman accused him of misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who both confirmed it.
On Friday, Trump conducted a week's FBI investigation on the complaint about Kavanaugh, and your election to the Senate was completely canceled.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's assistant secretary, is on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for this week has not yet been fixed, probably for this week, I see all the other things happening in the Supreme Court.
But as soon as we see it, I'll always tell the journalists."
Some journalists did not appreciate this apology: Sanders never killed journalists in Maison Blanche until September 10.
The organizer, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the reconnaissance of journalists is not because of the lack of love for "new publishers" on television but says, "I don't refuse to have them."
But he promised to increase the direct meeting of journalists and Trump.
"The president is holding a meeting with more questions and answers than with previous presidents, "just as he added, there is no evidence: "We have already looked at these figures."
The meeting will continue, says Sanders, but "if journalists have the right to ask the US President a direct question, that is better than talking to me.
We will try as much as we can and you will find that we have done so many times over the last few weeks and that will replace the press conference so that you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump always answers questions when leaving Maison Blanche or when he participates in free meetings or gathering journalists when visiting authorities.
It's not just a conversation with journalists.
Perhaps the president in New York this week showed why he didn't read the headlines and make a strange post when the journalists met.
The Health Secretariat wrote to the staff of the European Group at NHS Scoltand about the possibility of Britain's release
The Health Secretariat wrote to the staff of the European Group working in the NHS in Scotland to express their appreciation for their country and their desire to stay after Britain's departure.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter to visit the European Group in the short term of Britain.
Citizens of the European Group working for the government of Ecosse have already agreed to pay the bill.
Ramatoa Freeman, in his letter, said: "For the last year, the agreement with Britain and the European Group on the exemption continued to lead to a decision pending this end.

I know you're all crazy about it.
That's why I say it's important to me that everyone's role comes from, not from the country of origin.

The Turkish team of Tennessee State has faced an immediate investigation following a head injury on Saturday, which won the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, according to a report by Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, a Tennessee State journalist, told reporter that the accident occurred shortly before the first phase ended.
"He's come to the edge of the square and looks like a rock here," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given by teachers and oxygen - health workers at the border before taking him to a hospital and bringing him back to visit.
An authority from Tennessee State told WSMV employee Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was released to Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there's no idea about the injury he's got" and will try to help Tennessee State when the investigation is under way.
Abercrombie and her first time in Tennessee State after she moved from Illinois.
Five tickets he made on Saturday before he went out of the stadium, resulting in about 18 tickets he made at this time of the game.
Foreign buyers will be required to buy houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to gain wealth in Great Britain and will also contribute additional money to help the homeless in the new Tory scheme
The protest will hinder Corbyn's success in his campaign to identify young voters
It is thought of by those who do not pay taxes in Great Britain.
The government government hopes it will increase to 120 million each year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be required to gain wealth in Great Britain and to add extra money to help the homeless, says Theresa May today
It will be considered to be an effort to stop Jeremy Corby's success in his process of identifying young voters, he promised to provide housing for high-ranking campaigns and awards.
Everyone and non-profit companies in Great Britain will be expected to pay for this high tax, adding money to support the government's fight on the streets.
The increase in the burden of more than now, including the highest amount required from two years to two-storey and three-hundred-and-a-half times.
The government budget expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
Thirty-six percent of London-based new houses are estimated to have been sold by non-residents in England, making their prices expensive and difficult for those who have just bought them or one.
Many of the wealthiest parts of the country in the city have become "strong cities" because many foreign citizens spend most of their time abroad.
Boris Johnson has introduced the new policy, which has just called on the campaign to help young people to have a home for themselves.
He said the land and houses were too expensive because large construction companies were using them, and he encouraged Rtoa May to set up house purchases in order to create the "Bretgne's treasure for housing."
Mr. Corbyn made several interesting comments on the change in property, including the monitoring of housing and the abolition of "no reason."
He also wanted to give more authority to the officials to be able to build new houses.
Ramatoa May said: “I said last year that the restoration of Britain’s dream would be a priority for the ever-increasing generation.
And that means our oil will be poured on the property market.
England is open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it would not be easy to buy a house in the same British country that is very hard to live in, just like a foreign company.
For many people, they just dreamed of having a house, and the capacity of the road traffic is still visible and there is."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest wish is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland leader Jack Ross said his "most important wish" is to lead Scotland to a better future.
Scott, 42 years old, will be happy and ready to re-open the North-East club, which now has the third number of First League, less than three in the first number .
She moved to the Lighthouse after she led St. Mirren back to Scotland's capital in the last game.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got stuck in B and that's it," Ross said to the BBC sound of Ecosy's Spoon.
"I grew up watching Ecos in Hampden with our father as a child, and that was always what brought me back.
But I will be able to do so, if the club manages."
Ross was running from the Sunderland administration: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said it was not difficult for him to follow the names listed for such green clubs, if the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town were rejected.
"The success I had before was controlled by ‘Can I go back to the club with the First League?’
Because because of the way it works and conducts in this club it is sure to belong to the First League," he just said.
"It's not easy to get it here, but I think I will succeed if I can get back to the club."
Only three years later Ross managed, after working a little as an assistant director in Dumbarton and was one of the enthusiastic teachers for 15 months.
Thus, he helped the Alloa to recover after his third grade, and the next time St. Mirren was raised by the winner's successor to the war.
And Ross said he's got a better life now than he's ever had during his games at Cycle, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's certainly a service," he just said, about welcoming the Alloa.
"I really believed that it was better for me to manage than to play.
It's strange to hear it, but I don't have a reason, I've developed a sense of life in it, and I've tried to have some perspectives.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you can do every week.
I still live there when I work hard and work hard but management goes for it.
I've always wanted to take the lead and I've done it, that's why I've been doing it for the rest of my life."
The entire survey, on Radio Scotland, will be held at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, from 12 to 1 p.m. in England.
It's a good time to drink beer tomorrow at 5:30, according to an investigation.
The market did not go to these alcoholic drinks, but now people are full of heat, but food is no longer available.
According to the study, the market share of alcohol sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, but food prices decreased by 4.8 percent.
When Peter Martin, a consultant at the CGA company, saw these figures, he said: "The day was always hot and England had a longer share in the Battle of Ballina Kitra, and the events continued until July. The amount of money for the sale of alcohol then increased by 2.8 percent, and there was no shortage of food.
The food distribution rate in June decreased by 1.8 percent, and the market has not increased in July.
The drinking place of alcohol has become the most popular and expensive until the restaurant has lost its appetite.
Traders have also not lost their appetite for these hot temperatures, only to gain benefits compared to food.
It's like people just want to get out to drink.
The sales in these wine shops increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food prices decreased by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, who is a surveyor for housing and hospitality at RSM, said: "This thing has started since April, and continues.
Street vendors have become so exhausted from the weather and sports competition.
It is not surprising, then, that food facilities are always under stress, which will be very safe for them because the income has decreased by 4.8 percent during the year, but the cost of food is rising and rising.
The food vendors are very confident about these high temperatures during these years, but we cannot say if the climate changes changed during August."
As the increase in the sales volume of these alcohol-consuming markets, including those recently opened, increased by 2.7 percent in July, although no sales documents were available.
The sales organizers of the Coffer Peach Tracker looked at the results of 47 coffee and alcohol sales organizations and ate in the English country, and noticed that the cash flow increased to 9 billion euros, which led the sales to good luck.
One child in five has a hidden account on the website that his parents don't know about.
A survey found that one child in every five – the smallest of 11 years of age – has a hidden account on a website that his parents or teachers do not know about.
Some 20,000 students were surveyed and many said they had a "inta secret" page.
The news says that they are threatening to increase what they share.
20 percent of the children said they have a "closed" account to get to know their parents.
1 child of every 5 – with 11 years of age – has a hidden account on the website that adults do not know.
A survey of 20,000 students in the school found that children with "insta secret" accounts have increased, that is, on the Instagram website that can be shared.
The news says that they are threatening to increase what they share.
Twenty percent of the children said they have "closed" accounts to show their parents, but they also have hidden accounts.
A single mother saw her 13-year-old daughter's black account, and found a young woman telling people, "I'm hungry."
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18 years olds had double accounts, and some of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "Singing that many young people want to open a secret account that their parents and teachers will not know."
Elidh Doyle is a "phone of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council
Elidh Doyle was appointed by the Scottish Athletics Management Board to be chairman during the annual meeting of the organization.
Doyle, the most famous athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie, announced that this has been done to enable organizers to benefit from Doyle's ability and experience over the last ten years at the international level.
"Eilid is very respectful of the sports community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we can be sure that it will benefit the sportsmen in Scotland if it is included in the decision," Beattie said.
Doyle says: "I am happy to represent "the sound of athletes," and I hope that I will be able to move and help improve sports in Scotland."
The American, who got his grandfather at 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 – who had four of his gold medals – and often in BBC sports, could not go because blood in his brain was stopped for a while.
He wrote on Twitter: "I'm on a blood march, one month today.
I can't go.
The doctor said that I did not know whether I would be willing or not, that it would depend on the passing of time and not on how.
It’s so hard, I’m already very tired, I’m starting again and I can’t hold on!
Thank you for the encouraging message!"
The market document on water pumps, which compares the mother's mother to the female
The sales documents made by a water-producing company that compares believing and female mothers have been discussed online.
Elvie's company released a video showing a family parent who commented on the use of this tool, when she did what to announce the call: "The first soundless voice in the world."
This is part of the song that contains four families singing in a soft house: "I just take water from me, but I don't have a boat" and "If you don't see it well, I don't know it."
So it goes back: "I'm helping, I'm helping, I'm giving children water; I'm helping them, I'm giving them water."
However, when the sales document, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused much controversy on the Internet.
The video was seen by 77,000 people, and hundreds of people commented on it. It was different from the behavior of the people who saw it, and many said that it was a "bad story" for the mining industry.
"The idea of using the product does not go far enough.
For example, these cows need to be brought before a flood, if they are not taken away from their newborn child,” said one person who commented.
This Elvie pump (Elvie/Mother) can be hidden in the soutien gorge
Another wrote: "It will certainly not be possible for parents and children to be afraid of them.
But why is it that they are used to make a hand-carp for a mother taking care of her child?"
Others say, "It's really a new market."
Others have made a good comment about the marketing document, for example, saying that the song is “good. ”
"It's a good idea.
I bought this as an example when I was still a believer
I even thought I was like a woman when I used help.
The sales document is a little clear, but it's just what I want.
The idea is very good," said one person.
Another wrote: "The document is made fun of a family parent who uses paamps (in use or in the exit room) who feels like a "smoker".
The sales document was not designed to open up or criticize the producer company's water products."
At the end of the video, all the women who had played were showing each other what they had done in soutien.
There are a lot of women who feel like bullies when using dolls. That's what they really want to do behind the shop.
The Elvie Paompy doesn't really sound, but it doesn't need a signal but comes in soutien, so the parents can move or hold their children and go to the poll when they use it.
Ana Balarin, who is an ECD and a working partner in Mother's company, commented: "The Elvie Poompy is going to change people's lives and should be made up of misleading documents to make it known.
We want to show everyone what our parents feel we compared them to women in the shop, and everyone sees the difficulties these women see, because this market document has made women feel much better when they use it.
The Elvie Poompy has not yet become an interesting news story.
A two-born mother used the ironing tool for famous painter Martha Jakubowski during the Fashion Week in London.
Hundreds of children living in refugee camps in the border of Texas
The number of children who have moved to live has increased, although the number of people who have moved abroad every month has not changed, and the reason for the talk by Trump and his strong policy has become more difficult to accept and care for these children, even if someone is willing to take care of them.
In the past, immigrants were often the only ones who had no legal letters to care for these children, and they became afraid that they would not be able to stay in the country if they asked for a child to come home.
The fear has increased since June because federal authorities have announced that adult children and other adults who do the same, and will then be given the authority to manage migration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of the immigration and Custom Enforcement organizers in front of the Congress, said there were dozens of people asking for a home for children who were injured by the organization.
The organization then said 70 percent of the victims had not been protected from crime.
"More than 80 percent of the people who ask for their home, or their families, are immigrants but have no legal papers, and many of them are criminals in their country of origin.
We're still looking for these people," says Atoa Albence.
The organizers are quick to handle the case of their children and have created new laws that will allow their children to raise tribunals 30 days after their arrival, rather than wait 60 days as usual, which is common in the detention camps.
Many people use videos, but they don't come directly when judges are supposed to judge the immigrants.
The judge has no choice but will soon return to his country of origin.
Over the months, people working in the children's camp have said that when the children are arrested, they become more afraid and discouraged, and that some people are even trying to escape.
Lawyers said they had increased their potential from a larger organization such as Tornillo, and they were afraid, the children who were worried about getting no care.
They also said that if the children were taken to the camp but not enough time to prepare their minds and hearts when they left their friends, the pain and fear that they had already experienced and that they had struggled hard.
US and French soldiers and Turkey have asked Syria to leave their country immediately
The Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke directly at the United Nations summit, and asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war in the country had lasted for eight years.
Atoa Moualem, who was also a Deputy Prime Minister, announced that soldiers had landed in Syria but had not been allowed, as they were growing up to fight terrorism, and "compensating punishment."
"Those soldiers should leave immediately and be out of line," he said at the meeting above.
Atoa Moualem confirmed that Syria's “war of terrorism is about to end, and more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee for it.
He also said that Damas is still "continuously pursuing the holy war" to "clean the Syrian land" to allow terrorists and other illegal fires in their country.
Some 2,000 US troops are in Syria, who have been invited to train and advise Kurdes and Syrian Arabs to fight the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.
The war is over 1,000 French soldiers in this wheely country.
When Atoa Moualem spoke about refugees, he said that they could move to his country, and he blamed “some of the Western countries” who “screamed and threatened” refugees and made them stay far away from their country.
"We have already called the International Family and the human rights organization to take away refugees," he says.
"They're trying to get people involved in politics."
The United States and the European Union have said they will not help to bring the damage to Syria unless they make an agreement with Assad to stop the war.
The UN diplomat said that the agreement with Russia and Turkey was free to open a political debate on establishing an integrated area among the Idlib security forces.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented Syria (supported by Russia) from attacking the area of three million inhabitants.
But Moualem confirmed that the treaty's endurance was limited and said that Jihadits hoped that the private army would join, to be “completely eliminated”, including Al-Qaeda attackers related to Nusra-Front.
Staffan de Mistura, a UN diplomat, said that it is hoped that the first meeting of the new committee set up by the government and the opposition would set up laws for Syria to deal with the results of the war and lead to elections.
Moualem has taken action on the involvement of the Syrian government in the committee, including that the trial should be held "to re-examine the texts of the current law" and the warning of discrimination in the case of another country.
How to make sure that Trump wins again
If logic is, Trump will only win the election in 2020 if it is not possible to win a coup or a coup and leave the government as secure as the liberal analysts hope.
And there is no doubt that it could be "the end of the regime to be the most historic ever!"

Since 2014, the number of CNN TVs has increased by more than 1.05 million and MSNBC has reached three times as high as 1.6 million.
For Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million in the last four years. According to Nielsen and MSNBC, the most famous and most popular "The Rachel Maddow Show" show is the program, since it has been viewed by some 3.5 million new followers at night.
"It's like a fire that burns people because we don't know anything," says Neal Baer, a story that goes on with ABC "Designed Survivor", about the writer in a office who became president after the attack destroyed the state building.
Nell Scowell, a writer and humorist and wrote "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, however, had a different view.
He remembered the road in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him to choose Mr. Trump.
But why? she asked.
"He said, "He's attracted to me," says Ms. Scowell's story.
In fact, the matter of flirting can lead to adultery.
Of course, it is not like anything on television, but the story from Washington describes the future of Roe v. Wade, either the ability of immigrant families to meet again or the general economic health.
The television program is highly respected, only people who have access to it.
However, more than knowing how to be a citizen of the news you seem to be following the six-hour debate by Bob Woodwards based on the "deep training" he needed in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar Austrian dresser ("a prominent family", according to Washington Post) and the slow financial comparison by Stormy Daniel on Mr. Trump.
If I were myself, I would never think that Super Mario would be the same.
"One of the things she feels like a real show, she sees something you have every day," said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and created the "Pawn Stars," about the backdrop of Trump's games and his daily hideouts (war against N.F.L., breaking Kim Jong-un).
You will not be able to stop following even one episode unless it is completely lost.
I saw Atoa Fleiss this week, on the day of the 80-degree line outside Kaui's northern coastal house, that he still looks at MSNBC and hears CNN.
He is not sure, especially when he saw Brett Kavcanough directly interfering with the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we returned these stupid scenes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Atoa Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was like a joke, but it turned out, their words were true."
Amy Chozick, one of many of the writers in The Times about business, politics and media, wrote the story entitled "Chasing Hillary."
The president's year's work year is supported by a popular election
It is no wonder that the money working in the 17th district of Pennsylvania has increased greatly through cooperation with the districts' congress and has been allowed to set up two different competitors to fight one place.
This rural district of Pittsburgh has moved Conor Lamb from the Democratic Republic to take place in other districts during the last special election.
Lamb now competes with other authorities, no one but Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the 12th districts of the former Pennsylvania which are closely interfering with the new 17th district.
The map was rewritten following the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that the former districts were illegally distributed to provide the Republic with benefits.
The competition to get the seventeenth district was a financial competition between the money changers and the Congress of the Committee on Democracy (DCCC), and the National Committee of the Republican Promotion (NCRC).
The name of the people in Pennsylvania became known as Lamb after all they could see in the special election of the 18th district convention in Pennsylvania, March.
The Republicans have been holding this place for many years and President Donald Trump has received the district at 20.
Democrats have given little advantage to politicians.
A lecturer from the U.S. Department of Justice, who punished El Salvador with severe punishment for his support of China, then withdrew.
Many diplomats note that Beijing has already accepted the Dominican Republic and Panama, which has contributed a little to Washington.
Atoa Trump met with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, he had a hotel in Panama waiting for security supporters of Trump's organization's management team.
According to a report gathered at the beginning of this month, representatives from the State Department decided to call back the US diplomatic mission running from El Slvador, and the Dominican Republic and Panama to consider "the decision not to accept Taiwan as soon as possible," as well as Heather Nauertn and women representing the department.
But only El Salvador was affected by the sanctions, which received $140 million food aid in the United States in 2017, including surveillance of drug use, development and financial aid.
The penalties considered to be applicable, including the elimination of money laundering and the abolition of legal visas, will indeed be very difficult for Central America, which adds to the level of unemployment and mass murder.
According to the outcome of the meeting, the major conference on peace and economic development has been postponed by the authorities in North and Central America to allow such meetings as last year to be seen as a step in the effort to stop immigrants from going to the United States.
But at the end of September, the top authorities showed that they wanted to hold the conference, to end all the penalties that El Salvador should apply.
The vision of President Mike Pence, which should be held in mid-October, has been scheduled for the conference to be held by the chairman in order to identify what is really important.
And three American representatives returned quickly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, making a sad message about the punishments from Washington.
Atoa Bolton, the "Maison Blanche" speaker, discussed his details on the debate presented by the three American authorities, two diplomats, and agreed to examine its internal decisions and the non-representation measures.
A foreign examiner, right-hand in management and part of talking about the measure of non-renomination, supported their story.

The next possible objection is the report of special legislator Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's threat, which has a general basis.
Atoa Mueller also returned to his investigation to see how much of Atoa Trump's scandals he joined Russia in the election.
Whether Congress should change management, Atoa Trump has to face its responsibility, as he has prepared for the public elections, and perhaps his friends' judges.
There are many, but this does not mean that it is impossible to ignore Attoa Trump's warning or the like of it in Europe.
There are many options for each of us to make from both sides of the Atlantic and will have consequences for the possible suffering of the problem .
In 1938, German dignitaries were ready to attack Hitler, while Westerners agreed to oppose him and persecuted the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and failed to stop people's lives for years.
History has always been influenced by confusing ideas, as well as by rapid or anti-democratic propaganda.
The Americans are now living in conflicting and conflicting ideas.
What can we do if Atoa Trump doubles General Rod Rosenstein, a monitor for the investigation process on Mueller?
Roesenstein's location has been fragmented since the report last year said that she had suggested that the president's census and supported the lack of respect for the place.
Atoa Rosenstein said the story of The Times was wrong.
"How can we answer if the F.B.A.'s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh- or even if the Supreme Court is so angry that there is a clear charge of sexual violence and false testimony?
But above all, will we choose Congress that can hold Atoa Trump as responsible when it comes to his time of work?
If we fail these efforts, democracy will remain with us for a long time.
But I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew and was exiled to Auschwitz during the Nazi regime that had once sat in my embassy home.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is fully prepared to meet Rapid Vienna
The Rangers took Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that if they win the Austrians, after a war like in Spain with Villareal this month, they will have a chance to be released from the G class in the European League.
Graham Dorrans was unable to go up because of his head injuries after a game of about 2-2 with Villareal, but he believed that the results could be used well by Rangers to start better.
"It's great for us because the 31-year-old man is a good place in Villareal.
"We went into the game and were confident that we would get results and went out with a number.
Maybe we can do this in the end but, anyway, the same war is just like that.
They broke out in the first half and we will also do better by the second half.
It's going to Thursday, and it's going to be for Europe another night.
There is a lot of hope that we will get three but the game will be famous because they have good results in the final game, although with the people who support us, I believe we will continue to make progress and see good results.
It's been a great year, despite the damage I've experienced and the change in the club, but there's just been a improvement in the place right now.
The team was good and the bandits were happy to play it; the training was really good.
We can continue to make progress, and full of hope, let the turn of the success fail."
Women looking for ways to deal with their drinkings are not honest day and night.
Although it is well known that members have clear ideas on how to care for them, few people have discussed this with their families.
Half of the respondents said she told her husband about money spent on long-term treatment.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People like it when their family takes care of it, but they try to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, head of life insurance.
This is what we're going to start.
Talk to your parents. You can’t be prepared to take care of your family when you’re sick if you don’t talk about it.
Work with your counselor and family, and discuss how to care for your health. This is especially important if you are to make money.
Include your contributor in financial terms: Your advisor can also give you a way to pay for that money.
The following can be found to care for your long-term health: long-term health care, life insurance, or special health care.
To set up a legal letter for you to use: The war against your trial is also about to be fought.
Get people to represent you in the matter of health, so that someone you trust will be responsible for watching the health workers follow your choice, if you can't talk.
You are also looking for a lawyer to take charge of your month.
You will choose a trusted person to represent you in making a decision about the money, and you will be sure that your facts are first, if you become critical.
Don’t forget his details: Think of your parents as old as you are, and need urgent medical care at the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about the medicine or what they are not?
Write them down in detail, so that you can be ready.
"It's not just about money, but who's the doctor?" said Martin.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the terrible earthquake and tsunamis in Palu, Indonesia, in the summer, according to the authorities.
The connection was completely broken, so the authorities did not know the news from Dongrya, north of Palu. This was the location near the headquarters of the earthquake that hit 7.5 in the background.
More than 16,000 people were deported from Palu after the accident.
This is about Palu and Dondria, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, at the end of the river along the Sulawesi River. The population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th year, when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dodrya is a 300 km municipality in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality is smaller than its territory, so Dongrya's population is estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
The region of the Central Sulawesi region, especially the coast of Dodrea, is the main source of food, food and feed.
Many tourists also traveled there, but in Morocco, on the island along with Sulawesi.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Dodrya have been hit by earthquakes, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
A tsunami struck Dogrea in 1938, killed more than 200 people, and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami struck Dogrea in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the vast Pacific earthquake zone, and it is often hit by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquake and tsunamis that have been happening today:
2004: A major earthquake struck Aceh, North Sumatra, on the west coast of Indonesia, on December 26, which caused tsunamis to rise to 14 and killed 226,000 people who created the Indian Ocean. More than half of the dead were killed in Aceh.
2005: There were a number of major earthquakes on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.

Sarah Palin's Last Child Arrested, Due to Domestic Violence
Track Palin, next to Sarah Palin, former Alaska government, was arrested as a vice president, for violence.
Palin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, was concerned about violence in his home because someone told the police that he was violent. He also opposed his arrest, according to a report by the Alaska Police.
Police say Palin's sister called the police to report the crime, and Palin left the phone behind.
Palin was held in Mat-Su's prison, and was convicted of paying 500 dollars, KTUU said.
He came to the court on Saturday, saying "surely not guilty," according to news source.
Palin has three simple A crimes against Palin, that he may be arrested for years and pay $250,000 if he is convicted.
A simple classic B was also attacked, and if he was convicted, he could be held in jail for one day and pay $2,000.
It's not the first crime to attack Palin.
He was accused of violence against Todd Palin, his father, also in December 2017.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report.
The Alaska Supreme Court is now considering this case.
He was convicted of domestic violence in January 2016, according to a combined report, and had weapons and ammunition.
The woman with him said she took the keys in her face.
In 2016, paramilitary Sarah Palin was criticized for claiming that this violent attitude is related to the military situation in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed by the earthquake following Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia, in the summer.
The 7.5 earthquake caused tsunamis, destroying thousands of homes.
The lights and telephones are out, and the number of dead may continue to rise.
The earthquake hit the center of Sulawesi, which is in northern Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on different websites, showing the earthquake.
Hundreds of people have saved a seagoing party, when the tsunami hit Palu.
Federal law prosecutors seek to accuse the accused of committing terrorist acts in New York City.
New York's federal prosecutors like to hear that Sayfuly Saipov, accused of committing a terrorist act in New York City and killed eight people.
Saipov, 30 years old, was reportedly using a truck to attack people on the road by bicycle, on the West Road, in the Lower Manhattan. He attacked many passengers and drivers in October.
The prosecutors must prove why they have asked for a death sentence, that Saipov killed eight dead persons, and “a religious spirit” injured people, according to a statement of the death penalty, located in the South District of New York.
Both charges, according to the court's letter, may result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, the deputy judge accused Saipov of 22 cases, including eight charges of killing people by violence (used by law prosecutors in criminal matters), violence and car destruction.
The attack called for "good preparation and thinking," said the lawyer, and they explained how Saipov had done the attack "full of hatred, abuse and really bad."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has done everything to harm, harm, and bring grief to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," according to the report.
Five of the dead are visitors from Argentina.
New York's Southern Court has been planning the final case for a death sentence for more than ten years.
Khalid Barnes was then convicted of killing two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to death in September 2009.
In New York there was already a death sentence in 1953. Juluis and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were killed, when they were convicted of being a Soviet spy during the Cold War two years ago.
He and his wife were killed in a power station on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, never showed up after days and months after the attack, according to the court's report.
She told the police that she had made a confession that she was happy about what she did.
Saipov told the authorities that he was forced to take the attack, after watching the ISIS video on his phone, according to the letter of condemnation.
She also asked for ISIS's permission in her hospital room.
He said he was innocent of the 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said they were "missed", in the decision of the prosecutors.
Patton also said: "The case is going to be longer and it will bring back to the minds of everyone involved, because the prosecutors have decided to ask for a death sentence, not only did the person admit his guilt, so that he would be imprisoned until his death, and will never be released.
Saipov's lawyers asked the lawyer not to ask for a death sentence.
NIGEL Farage says the European Group's determinants should not be considered to lead to the European Group's exit agreement
Nigel Farage, protesting the debate on the European Group's stay, said he must ‘call the crowd’ today.
The former Ukip leader says politicians should be ‘to feel the heat’ from those who don’t want to join the European group, and one of Theresa May’s supporters says he should be discussing the European Union.
Native poet Peter Bone said that the request to Birmingham would be no longer, if Farage was the author of the European Union's liberation.
It is a major challenge for dRtoa May to bring peace to its citizens, as some of them have joined the opposition to the rest of the European Union.
The prime minister strives hard to be able to travel, as everyone who wants to leave the European Group and who wants to stay there, and even the European Union.
His supporters say they should always agree with Brussels, even though it has already been established, so that European groups and groups of workers will be forced to choose whether to accept their views, or to find a 'crowd'.
Atoa Bone told the Leavers, during the Solihul event, that he wanted to 'bet the prime minister's agents.
She said she should be a friend of Atua Farage, and the agreement with Brussels will be planned.
He said: 'We'll be out of the European Union now, if I'm responsible for it.'
Wellingborough also says: 'I will support the release of the European Union, but we should cut off the refugees.'
He said, against the European Union: 'We have not been born to be a citizen during the major wars.
We want only if we set the law for our country.
The idea was rejected by Attoa Bone that people may have changed their minds after the 2016 election. 'The British people have changed their minds, so they want to stay in the European Union.
Andrea Jenkyns, a retired European Group spokesman, said: 'This is all I say: Listen to the people, the Prime Minister.
'Most people don't want those who don't want to change, the opposition won't choose it, the party we have and the protesters here don't want it, they're going to go to the streets, and they're going to vote for us first.
Don't follow those who don't want to change, but go ahead.'
This is the message he said to dRtoa May: 'The prime minister is kept in his job when he keeps his word.'
Politicians who protested Atua Farage said they should be "feeling the heat" if they want to reverse the decision in the 2016 referendum.
"Somewhere about us—people—and this is politicians," he said.
'They want to translate the issue into the European Union, but we are here to tell them that 'we will not let you do that.'
This is what he said to the angry people: 'I want politicians who want to change the exit to the European Union if you're going to "feel the heat".
'We call a lot of people here, because they have made us decide to leave the European Group. We will never stop unless we become an independent, private country, and Great Britain has a reputation.'
On the other hand, residents of the European Union traveled to Birmingham, prior to a two-hour protest in the middle of the city.
The protesters brought banners, saying they wanted to stay in the European Union.
In the Workers' Party, Adonis highlighted the consequences of the unsafe security issue on the party's computer program, at the beginning of the discussion.
He said: ‘These are the people who tell us that they can set up computer programs and technology for Canada, and for the war on their borders, and for unlimited sales for Ireland.’
'This is really bad.
There is no such thing that it will benefit the European Group," he says.
Warren thinks the entry into the presidential candidate is a ‘good review’
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says "he will carefully consider accession as president," after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about the future, during their discussion at the city hall.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, in November, to compete with the Republican Geoff Diehl, who is one of the leaders of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
A lot of people have thought he could compete with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday morning in Holyoke was the 36th meeting, using the city's main election strategy, following the adoption of Trump's authority.
One of those who met asked him if he wanted to join the president.
Warren replied that this is the time "for women to go to Washington to improve our governance, so there should be women in the head of the government."
Someone was arrested for shooting at Sims, LSU player
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday the suspect was arrested and killed Wade Sims, LSU's baseball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge police report that Dayteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested 11 hours a day.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and they called people to tell who the man was on it.
Sims, 20 years old, died next to South University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was hit on his head by the shooting, and it killed him," said Murphy Paul, chief of police, to journalists, every 247 sports, on Saturday.
Wade protected his friend, so Simpson shot him.
Simpson was investigated, and admitted that he was there, had a gun, and admitted that he had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was easily arrested, and was kept at Baton Rouge Police.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, aged 1,83m, and participated in the 32th game, and was among the first 10 players in this game year. He played 17.4 minutes on his average, died 5.6, and played 2.9 rebond every time he played.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton became the world's heir, when the judge said he won Sebastian Vettel.
That is clear when Valtteri Bottas got to play before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, and Mercedes's team decided to take a lot of part in the race.
Bottas was very excited, and after Hamilton kept his place safe during the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to gather with his friend.
Vettel was the first to stop building, and allowed Hamilton to move, but it changed a lot.
Mercedes was a result of construction, and later after Vettel. However, Hamilton went on to follow along. Ferrari's driver was suspicious, so he let his way out of it, and he could no longer protect his place, in his third attempt.
Max Verstappen is the last one, and the seventh at the end of the first round, now 21 years of age.
But then he led most of the race, and kept it until the end, and met Kimi Raikkonen, who became fourth.
He went to the building only on the 44th move, but his pace could not increase during the last eight rounds, so Raikkonen went to number four.
It's hard because Valtteri fought hard this weekend, and I was released, according to that man.
The team did a lot of good," Hamilton said.
A Real Mistake
President Donald Trump, during the protest on Saturday, urged Senator Diane Feinstein, as Feinstein confirmed that he had not issued a secret letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused Brett Kavanaugh, who might have been appointed high-ranking judge, of committing sexual crimes.
The president spoke during the event in West Virginia, but did not speak directly about Ford's words in front of the Judge's Senate, but he said some were "bad and lying" when he looked at what happened at the Assembly.
"It's wonderful and beautiful in the House of Commons, when you see anger, when you see people angry and wicked and lying," he says.
“When you see what he has published and the secret he has published, but he says slowly, “I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do You Recall?
Did you publish a secret from Diane Feinstein?
Remember his answer... did you publish these letters? "Oh, how?"
Not at all.
I didn't do that."
How so?
Did we issue a secret... Oh, no, we didn't do that," he said, about the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July, explained ford’s complaint to Kavanaugh, and published it in September, but Feinstein said that his office did not release the secret.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's words, and I didn't publish his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it secret, and I always did."
The president said it was not fair, however, in his speech on Saturday night. "It was a very wrong move.
He probably didn't do it, but his reaction was the most wrong move I've ever seen."
The president defends the one who may still be appointed a high-ranking judge, even though three women accused him of committing sexual crimes with them, the president said the charges were made by the Democrats of political instruments.
"They are willing to support their ideas in all ways.
You see the appeal, regardless of what they have been forced or forced to gain power and control,” said the Mediate president.
League Large: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer, Giant's team, was killed twice in a fight against Dundee
Dundee's team was protected when the Belfast Giants hit the dawn, and they won 5-3 of the game back to Dundee this afternoon.
The Giants were first killed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
But Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, and Dwyer killed the third, and the Giants took the lead again.
Francois Bouchard renegotiated for Dundee, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen killed the two leading winners.
His third team of Adam Keefe has won this Elite League, but they won Dundee 2-1 at midnight in Belfast.
Four of these teams fought against this game year, and the Giants won the first three games.
Dwyer died of a gun from Kendall McFaull at 3.35. David Rutherford helped Beauvillier and made them move, four minutes later.
Many footballers were killed at the beginning, and Sullivan restored the player to the game in 13.10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt met him for Crownie, at 15.16 minutes.
Dwyer did what the Giants would do in the first season, since he killed the second ball at the end of the first season of the night.
But the householder replied again, and Bouchard raised their number in 27.37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen die, so that Dundee would be the first in the game, in the second half, to win his team five, which was the number that finally split.
The Giants are now out of their five games, and on their land will play next Friday, with Milton Keynes.
The Rescuer Is Dead, to Help Aeroplanes Bring Hundreds of People to a Good Place
It was praised that the Indonesian rescue worker was brave, because he had done something to help a pilot bring hundreds of people to safety.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were still missing, after the great earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
The earthquake continues in many places, and many still suffer from floods in Palu.
His 21-year-old colleague Anthony Gunawan Agung fled to save his life, but he did not leave his ship at Mutira Sis Al Jufri's Hall in Palu, despite being severely beaten.
He stayed there to help the Batik Air Flight 6321, who will be seated there, so the plane was placed in a safe position.
He then jumped away from his workshop when he thought it would fall.
Then he died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, an Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman, says this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We planned a helicopter from Balilipan, Kalimantan, to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Sadly, though, this morning it was late, even before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We can hear it from our heart," he said.
However, the authorities are also afraid that the number of deaths might be over a thousand, as rescuers are prevented from entering Dodhea, Sigi and Butong.
"This number is growing, as many deaths are still under the chaos there, but many are still missing," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the victim's spokesman.
There were up to six feet of snow that destroyed Palu, and many were gathered there on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft now report assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says in Sky News: "There's always a patient car coming every minute, reporting death.
The water is fresh and fresh.
The collapse of the market is affecting everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, president of the Croix Rouge Internationale in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Croix Rouge is running to help the living but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already very dangerous that it might be even worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Saturday and said to the nation's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the work related to the release of people from danger.
Are you ready?" CNN's report says.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was devastated by a disaster that occurred in Lombok, which killed 550 people.
Micronesia's aircraft surveillance: Air Niugini now says there was a man missing from the flight to Riakasia (or connected to the sea)
The railway route that has come down to Pacifique's station in Micronesia at this time says there is a man who has not been hit, after saying that all 47 passengers and workers have been released on the landing plane.
The Niugini Airport reported in its news that since Saturday afternoon she could not explain a man's identity.
The airport said she worked with local authorities and hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airport did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger’s particulars; it was as if it were his age or country of origin.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews when the plane crashed in water while trying to stay on the Chuuk Island airport.
Zoma authorities said seven people were taken to a hospital.
The train said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were not worried about their health.
It is still unclear what caused the earthquake and the real events.
The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy said they went into the race when they didn't get the piste.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane was more than a piste.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the airport's entry was very low.
"That's a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to walk into the water to save the exit if there was any danger in the plane crash.
He said the hosts were scared and panicked, and he was hurt a little bit.
The U.S. Navy said that the ships working near the repair of the ship were helping to rescue by using a boat that could be used to drive people to land, before the landing of the plane to 30 feet (100 feet) below water.
The instructions from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people were killed by plane crashing in the road recorded in PNG for 20 years but not including Air Niugini.
The runner displays a reminder of the night's falling victim to the spirit of the world.
The publisher was able to prove all the evidence on Saturday at the second trial of the man convicted of murdering a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
A teacher from the U.S. Department of Justice., Paul Rowlett has been witnessing for hours as an expert witness in the field of research.
He recorded to the jury how he used the reception to announce the actions of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received advice on the location of many mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the morning of his death, which was contrary to his earlier statement, says The Clarion Ledger.
When the instructions showed that his cell phone was with Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford stood in court on Saturday and proved that he was not in the villa that day.
When the publisher asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck said he was in Nashville."
Tellis also said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time he died.
The phone protected objects said they knew each other every week.
Rowlet said that it was a time after Chambers died that Tellis forced his cell phones, phone calls and Chambers to leave his cell phone.
"He's gone away from his life," Hale said.
Saturday's defenders have taken time to start the final support.
The judge said the war was just after that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
There are three musicians who make hip hops to watch the different way they look about this type, by filling their music with the good news.
The High Breed from Bristol says the hip hop has left its mark on political messages and is talking about social problems.
They want to go back to their source and restore the conscious hip hop for people.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have found another exhibition in ROYAUME-UNIS through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A nurse from NEW YORK preached to a married couple who left behind after she wrote "seed discrimination"
A child caregiver from New York is witnessing to a couple for a full-fledged divorce when a mother who claims to be "another black man."
The spouses refuse to be non-discrimination and the preaching of their own is similar."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who was born two, expressed disappointment when he saw that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black on his first day in 2016.
"It's a great deal of work to do," says a post sent by the wife of the wife of the Plato-Flaxman.
Either way, if she was supposed to send it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
When Plasco-Flaxman felt his "unsatisfied" disability, Maurice was released from the drama, saying that the former American nurse who was unable to do his job and he was taken to the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice's car was stolen one day at work and sent back on top of it.
Maurice is now witnessing to the couple to get her out and looks forward to $350 a day during the week, the first job she's been doing, even though there's no deal.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's a crime."
The couple responded to the claim that they were being discriminated against and said that the end of Maurice's work was the wrong thing to do, because they were afraid they would not trust him after he was injured.
"My husband sent something he didn't want to talk to."
He's not a fanatic.
His wife, Joel Plasco, says that we are not prejudiced by the post.
"But will you place your children in the hands of people you don't respect, even if it's not a religious spirit?
Your new child?
Come on."
Plasco, who compares the message to “his wife’s custody”, said that his wife had only two months and was in a "hard place".
"Are you looking for someone like that?
It's not very nice to do it," the bank employee for money use said.
While the case is still under way, public justice has been quick to blame spouses on social networks, beating them for their behavior and logic.
The authors of the Paddington book are concerned that readers don't understand the language, according to the new text.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the writing: “It’s hard to sit in a person’s place before reading it.
It is very exciting to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
He says that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before he was inspired to write the book for children by means of a small game, may be upset by his rejection, the 60th year of publication of the books was “a wild tale” after his death last year, he added his words.
As for Paddington, whose province is "the most important part of the family," he added that his father was proud of his final success.
"He's a smart man who doesn't speak, and he's not a selfish man," he said.
"But since Paddington is real, it's like you have a child who can do things: you're proud of them even if you didn't.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Despite his creation and his thoughts, Paddington has always made mention of it."
My daughter was gone and I had to live on the phone
Her daughter was sent to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in the end, but the doctor worked only to save her life.
"Nad kept calling that his departure was really bad, saying he didn't expect to do it," says the Ednan-Laperouse widow.
"Then I received a call from Nad saying he would die within two minutes and I had to save him.
And I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, I love you very much, sobian.
I will be with you shortly.
I will be with you.
The medications that the doctor gave her to keep her in touch stopped and left her body alone.
It was a time before he died that was the end of everything.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was true.
I didn't complain or cry because in a situation there were families and many people.
I must have kept it all."
At the end of Ednan-Laperouse, when she was saddened by the absence of her daughter, the plane went up with other passengers – forgetting the difficult war she had experienced.
"No one knows" he said.
"My head was raised and the sea was flooded all the time.
It's hard to see that I've experienced this feeling of Nad's humiliation that touched me through the train.
He needs my love and ability to live in his place.
I know she really loves her."
A grieving woman prints a letter to prevent suicide on the street
Two women who lost their loved ones in death work to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have published a letter from Welsh with a stirring message and a telephone number that people can call for help.
Davis's 13-year-old son, Tyler, began to suffer from rape and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he says.
Ramatoa Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a full-fledged nurse who moved in with her talk.
"Everyone knows her voice."
They kept saying that her smile explained all the rooms."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in the "very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was only 11 then, saw his brother after he killed himself.
This is what Ratoa Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will have an effect."
Davis has created the letters, "to let people know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even though it's a friend.
Don't sit in the dark – you need to talk."
Ramatoa Humphreys, who had been a friend of Davis for many years, died of Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he felt tired or tired or something else," he said.
"We noticed a change in his attitude two days before Christmas.
He was very critical of Christmas day – he didn't see anyone, anything, when he opened his gift to the children."
He said that his death was a terrible disaster for them but they had to do what they could to do: "This has made it difficult for the community.
This led to a separation from us.
But we must continue our lives and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is dangerous because the FBI's investigation begins
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked us for - a time-limited, limited - we might be able to bring unity," Flake said on Saturday, he continued his statement that he was worried about "the arrival" committee in the street where the supporters were not allowed.
Why is God Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not pleased with the FBI's investigation?
Their lack of encouragement is a matter of time.
The election is only five weeks left on November 6 - if the Republicans do not leave, they will be ashamed of their efforts to get the man they are looking for to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush received a phone call to send the Senator, encouraging them to support the Lord Kavanaugh who worked in the Bush House only and saw his wife Ashley, who is the special secretary of the Bush Lord.
What will happen after the FBI released its bid?
There will be elections in the Parliament which are currently 51 republics and 49 democracys.
It is still unclear whether at least 50 votes can be taken in the Kavanaugh Chamber of Divine Parliament, which would allow Deputy President Mike Pence to compete with him and put himself in the Supreme Court.
In North Korea, the number of protesters has gone down to Kim
North Koreans have moved to South Korea since Kim Jong-un arrived in the last seven years, said a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, who wrote a report from the Ministry of National Affairs, said there was a migration to 1127 opponents per year - compared with 2706 in 2011.
Lord Park said it was the strongest surveillance on the border between North Korea and China and the higher part taken by the Soviets.
Pyongyang did not make a public comment.
Most immigrants from the north were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally extended their borders.
Most of them flee from China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than without a military area (DMZ) between two Korea.
Chinese immigrants consider immigrants to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often take them for granted.
It has been noted that relations between the North and the South – still fighting in technical terms – have improved over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders from two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the cut-off agreement.
This was after a historic meeting in June with US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work with the general to reach a nuclear-weapon-free Korean minority.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"If there is no confidence in the US, our country's peace will not be assured and in that situation we have no idea that we will lose our first weapon," said Lord Ri in his speech at the GERMANY Conference in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "a little fool," saying he can't work in the Supreme Court.
Deputy Prime Minister Nancy Pelosi called the electorate of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, saying it would be impossible for him to work in the Supreme Court if his condition was considered.
Pelosi made this comment during a Saturday session at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't imagine that if there were women doing this, they said "the example of the little fool," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Chamber on Sunday.
Kavanaugh has deliberately rejected the allegations that he had been sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were still young.
During his first speech, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he was almost nervous and tired during his family discussions and his studies in third grade.
He also clearly blamed the Democrats on the committee, calling for his "inadequate killing behaviour" that angry liberals have attributed to Hillary Clinton's failure to elect as president in 2016.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh was a proof of his inability to work in the Supreme Court, as this showed that he was fighting against democracy.
He said: "I think he did what he wouldn't know about these statements, too, how he persecuted Clinton's supporters and the Democrats."
Pelosi questioned whether Kavanaugh's freedom seemed to be concerned if he was gone, and if many of the Democrats were to receive it at the National Assembly.
"This is what I say - if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only in the Supreme Court but he can't even be in this trial right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a D.C. judge at the time of Cour d'Appel Federale.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a judge of traditional traditions.
In listening to him to strengthen the situation, Kavanaugh took questions about the possibility of violating certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for stupid people to go to court and hope us to say, "is that not nice," Pelosi says.
And women need to use it.
That was true of many months and years of anger and resentment, and we did not leave our children if they did not cry.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, and you?"
He continued: “A woman who was there really helped me to say that she was also crying when she was angry, but she wrote a project that meant that when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was saying: “You may think I’m sad because she’s crying.
I'm angry."
And He Continued
And I thought it was very obvious."
The sea can be sent as a form of an explosion of anger in part, as people can't find their source.
One of the things I remembered when I started working, at a man's office, where I once had a hard time getting caught up in an unexplained rage, to take my older wife to my neck – a terrible but violent leader – to the point.
"Don't let them see you crying," he said to me
"He doesn't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they reach their goal."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic minister at the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his accession as president.
In 1987, when she got married to an outsider in a ship called Monkey Business Almighty Hart, Ramatoa Schroeder, when she was very young, had no reason to consider becoming president of the country.
"It's not a good decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There have already been seven candidates to vote in the competition, and the last thing they need is another candidate.
Someone called it "Blanche Neige and the Seven Boys."
Since the campaign has already gone, he agrees to raise money, and he promises not to go into the competition unless it's worth $2 million.
It was a war that had not been successful.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 for men only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked himself.
If he did the speech that he would not do official propaganda, the reaction is really cut off — gratitude to the people who supported him, independence from the system that made the collection and decision of voters more difficult than the representative, and angry with discrimination as a male or as a female — he has already become a student.
“You may have thought I was completely disappointed,” said Rtoa Schroeder remembered the journalist’s reaction to him.
"You may have thought Kleneex was my supporter company
Do I remember what they're going to do on my belly?
"He cried?"
How the U.S. and China's trade wars can be a blessing to Beijing
The deployment of arms in the US and China's trade wars has been slow, and if the war is not over, Beijing can benefit from the long-term prospects of disintegrating countries, according to experts.
Donald Trump, who was president of the United States, sent the first warning early this year by means of a violation of the major Chinese movement, including the solar energy, wind and aluminum windows.
The most rapid increase this week, with a new size of $200 billion (150 billion), is forced by half of all Chinese equipment entering the United States.
Beijing has responded to deaths each time, and here it has placed five to ten hundred dollars in American equipment.
China promised to connect ETAZONIA's shot-shot, and the world's second largest economy could not be expected to be seen soon.
The relief of Washington means respect for the demands, but the humiliation in the face of the United States is a very unpleasant thing to Xi Jinping's president of China.
However, experts have said that, if Beijing’s play is possible, it is possible to support China in a long-term way the US's pressure on trade, by reducing the level of solidarity between the two economies.
"The ability to make a political decision quickly in Washington or Beijing results in situations that start economic governance in one of those countries is even more dangerous than that of teachers if it's true," said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia's Center for New American Security, a group of researchers.
Syria 'is ready' to rehabilitate refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says refugees are ready to return voluntarily and call for help to rebuild the country's last seven years of war.
When the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke at the UN Congress, he said the situation in the country improved.
"Today, the local situation is more peaceful and secure than the development of the war against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the crime scene so that the law can be restored.
All the measures needed to return refugees to their country of departure for terrorism and the necessary economic measures are now in place that affect their daily lives and their lives.
It is estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need help from a searcher who will improve humanity.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would receive help to rebuild the country.
But he insisted that the aid would not be accepted by the countries that supported the conspiracy.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 with the US Team at the last 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
ETAZONIA is now a waste of oil in European countries and has not received Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe is able to regain its glory when it reaches the number 14.5 that they have requested to defeat the US of Captain Thomas Bjorn's team.
ETAZONIA's star, Phil Mickelson, who fought most of the competition, fired a water fire at par-3, 16 yards, giving Francesco Molinari a game.
The Italian golfer Molinari has become famous during all his rounds, he has become a player 1 in 4 from 5-0-0 because the current theme of the game began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was released by the lowest player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark on 5&4.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, the first player, descended from 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England who may have played with the latest Cup Ryder.
Spanish Sergio Garcia has become one of the oldest players in the eight Rider Cup, becoming the biggest winning player in Europe with 25.5.
“I’m not often crying but today my tears are not really my hands.
That was a very difficult year.
Thomas is most grateful for choosing me and believing me.
I was so happy, so happy to have a cup of coffee again.
It was about a team, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia was moved after Europe's victory.
He sent the threat to his brother John Ram, who banned American golf players known as Tiger Woods at 2&1 on a single Saturday game.
"I don't believe I'm excited about Tiger Woods. I've always looked at this man until I'm older," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods is always missing from four games in France and has records 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
It's a strange story with the most appropriate permission of the player who won 14 tickets after only Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team fought hard at the end of the week looking for a football field in addition to Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-end golf during a full match.
Jim Furyk, an American captain after his team's rape, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they're really fighting.
There was a time when we had little contact with Europe this morning.
We were on our way to a convention.
It's a struggle for Thomas.
He is a master at winning the race.
All 12 players are very skilled.
We will meet, we will work with our Ryder Cup Committee with the US PGA and we will proceed.
I love these 12 bands and I'm happy to work as a captain.
You must be active.
They arrested us.
