Where's your father?
Show me that.
What cheese do you want?
What's Tom's chances?
I hope that's enough.
I saw Tom before he saw me.
Can anyone pick up the phone?
Why isn't Tom happy?
I promise I'll bring her back.
What's in the folder?
We enjoyed playing baseball.
I drank coffee.
Are they for food?
That's a stupid question.
Health and happiness enjoy beauty.
Come with us.
What's the minimum wage in Ireland?
Although we don't have much money, I want to buy this picture.
Tom's not a conscious man.
Where's your father?
Would you read that to me?
I'm tired.
A man came to see me yesterday.
I had no idea Tom was so angry.
Ellen was running alone.
Can you read French?
I think that's true.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Am I wrong?
Our theme of the week is: . . . .
Even wise people are sometimes disappointed.
"This is my first flight, I'm nervous," said Hiroshi.
I guess you're hungry.
Let's have tea at 3:00.
I read this book.
You were always a little weird.
Go train outside.
I can't fix the refrigerator.
Where's your father?
This book isn't Tom's.
Be very careful with this.
I just want to speak French a little better.
What would you have done if you were ten years younger?
Tommy's gonna be a teacher.
I heard Tom and Mary talk about it.
Why don't you put your clothes on?
How do you feel about his relationship with us these days?
Do you have any more free places?
I think you've done enough.
Tom broke his neck.
Mary put Tom's eye on it.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.
Let's leave it for another time.
What's going to be tomorrow?
I'll clean it up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.
You know, it's funny.
Thank you so much!
I don't care what you think.
These bastards don't relax when they're gone.
I was judged.
She kept crying.
When she left the maternity leave, she went back to her old job.
I forgot to lock the key.
There's more important things for me.
They only look at the light side of the American economy
You have to pay yourself in advance.
I want to find my deposit.
I'm ready to talk.
How can you not like Tom?
I cried today.
That apple is big.

Your plan is in line with our policy.
You need to learn more.
Our car broke down last night.
Mrs. Suon is our English teacher.
Let's just let it go.
There's something else I need to do.
Let's eat dry.
You're crazy giving him money back.
I took my room to the hotel, and I went to bed right away.
There's something in Tom that I don't like.
I barely understood.
I'm looking for Tom.
Tom didn't kiss anyone.
Tom's got a map.
I bought it.
I've learned enough.
I've been working with Tom for three years.
She was tempted to buy the beer.
I don't like anything Tom does.
He doesn't leave much of his life.
Tom wanted Mary to learn French.
What did Tom bring with him?
Are we leaving soon?
A man must fulfill his obligations.
It's never been on the island.
I think it'll be the best.
I'm glad to hear it.
The idea we discussed in class yesterday really attracted my attention.
What would happen if an unexplained force hit an impenetrable object?
Let's play.
Why did you decide to deal with French?
She's been out of school for five days.
I wish I had continued with France.
We graduate tomorrow.
Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and hid himself.
Go get ready to lie down.
It's not a weapon.
This palace is paid with skin.
I didn't know what I was going to say.
Speaking French is a big party.
Did you actually try?
Hello.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you free.
You better not go.
This year the spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much smaller.
You didn't give me as much rest as you should.
I might be able to find time to help you.
Tom found it.
Tom wasn't very busy.
It's been five days.
His clothes always smell bad.
I have different things to do.
She's giving birth to a boy.
All the brides are beautiful on the day of their wedding.
I heard you were sitting right, it's bad for your back.
He's financially independent of his parents.
What's their purpose?
Great idea came to my mind.
My dream is to become a teacher.
Happy Christmas!
Tom didn't want me to leave Mary.
Let's ask her something else.
Ken's good at swimming.
Here you are.
The surgery took the bag out of his hand.
Please leave immediately.
Did you smell sweet to me?
She was worried she might be late for the train.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and arrived.
Come in.
How much is this sugar?
Tom locked the door.
I need to get back to work.
Looks like Tom like his new job.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
They're always missing school.
How tall is this mountain?
Please close the door when you get out.
You go ahead, I'll get you later.
Have you ever been to Nara?
I'm really tired.
I only have ten books.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
Excuse me, how much is this?
It's time to think about your past.
Will you be back?
I'm starting to understand it's gonna be impossible.
I've been waiting for three days.
He had no idea when to start.
The dark clothes stick around the body.
I'm pretty busy.
Go on this show, and when you get to the lighthouse, turn left.
Tom knows I'm home.
Don't miss this opportunity!
Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
Be careful not to fall.
You're my best friend.
How old is the Eiffel Tower?
We'll settle the matter.
The boy loves his parents.
If I had a choice, I wouldn't have done that.
Can you meet me with a lawyer who speaks French?
We printed 50 numbers from the invitation.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
He's very mad at you.
Can anyone answer my question?
I don't know where yours is.
Does anyone here know French?
He called me a cab.
You're going to London next week, aren't you?
He also speaks French.
Tom loves horses.
Why did you decide to deal with French?
You'll need it again.
I'm happy for her company.
Did you pay your phone account?
We've done the job, so we can walk.
Give your home!
Nothing interesting is happening in this little town.
I know someone who speaks French very well.
Happy birthday!
Oh, now I understand.
He's wrong with someone else.
Tom went to the doctor.
I don't care why.
My shirt's getting worse.
Karen's my heart.
They're not that bad.
There was a little confusion in the room.
Tom sent Kate home.
The rice has to be frozen.
Tom won't be here in time.
What does he do today?
He's about to be killed.
One glass of water, please.
You scared me.
I have to decide what to do.
I think Tom's doing well.
You don't understand.
I used my parents to ignore me.
I'm extremely busy.
I don't speak French well.
He had a photo in his letter.
What are you wearing in the suitcase?
Tom died yesterday.
We're going to the Edie school, too.
He'd give me a hand.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
I think you were right.
Tom was disappointed that he couldn't get into Harvard.
What's your favorite hot drink?
I'm following music at a university in Boston.
Can I take your coat?
I made a plan on our route.
I drank coffee.
He can drive a car.
I thought we could go to the museum together.
Tom got on the wrong bus.
He's achieved his goal.
Is that good French?
You deserve the reward.
Will you teach me some French phrases that I might need?
Are these conditions acceptable to you?
Tom's thirty years old and more.
I paid $30 for that.
Can I get your knife back?
A beautiful woman was set up in front of me.
Tom and Mary got married three years after they met.
I don't want him to give up.
Don't say anything to anyone.
I've seen you play tennis.
Looks like they got caught up in this again.
I mean it.
Just close your eyes.
She kept her secret for herself.
Is that your chemical?
He's gone forever.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think this should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His wish was finally fulfilled.
Do you want to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve great food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'll learn French this afternoon.
I had difficulty solving this problem.
How much time do we take?
They look so much like I don't know what it is.
We've got a lot of bad luck.
Please be patient.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
My rain prevented me from coming.
Ken calls me every day.
Our departure was delayed.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I don't deserve compassion.
Can't you?
No, they're too small.
He gave me what I needed.
I missed you!
As I grew up, I'm getting married to Tom.
It's going to be some kind of start.
How much sugar do you put on?
She seems to have a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom threw something on Mary's ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees started covering the list.
Look at my fingers.
She speaks English well, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You don't eat from the cake that I made, but your sister eats.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't speak French today.
I think that's yours.
Stand up, if you like.
Who told you my name was Tom?
It's Tomovo.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on the diet.
Speak aloud so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Will you go back to the beach this afternoon?
She's three years older than me.
I don't want to tell Tom I was in Boston.
I'm proud of the culture and dignity of the Germans.
My friends call me Ken.
Tom couldn't find a job.
I don't want Tom to make things worse.
He was the boss of the situation.
I need to have a daughter of this book.
He's married to the Stuartes.
Everyone's waiting for you.
What he loves is a wish.
Tom left his family and became an illegal.
Let's talk English.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
When's the last time he went to the beach?
Don't give up.
Because we didn't go to a picnic.
I want Tom to be here today with us.
I'm home.
Should I open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I have to get to the hospital.
Let me see this.
Our new ones were breathing.
Are you cold?
I've never been king of Tom.
I need you.
I like listening to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak French a little.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll find a job.
Do I have the right to join you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They understand each other well with their neighbors.
Didn't Tom say anything about it?
French is not so hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else has proposed to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are your goals?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd spend a lot of time together.
I forgot his name.
We're not speeding up.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the garage after the train left.
I've never seen Kit alive.
Do you want to wear my jacket?
I don't think I should ask him.
Be brief, please.
That's all Tom has to do.
I think you should be crazy not to leave.
I've spent a lot of time on these people.
I've been waiting so long.
You obviously don't want to do this for me.
Fresh fruits are good for you.
He has a good sense of humor.
He's finished Tokyo University.
I obviously agree that you have to move forward with your own efforts.
I've seen them around.
Tom's a pretty man.
It's awfully expensive.
Christofor Colum's endless achievements are a threat to Google, who doesn't know how to index the impartiality when someone's looking for Christopher Columb.
Please answer French.
Because of his heart, he did it.
I've been waiting too long for this moment.
Do your children know French?
I bought some Romanian books for the students.
Are you sure you want to leave?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to figure out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.
Didn't I interrupt something important?
The patient was healing a little less.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom asked Mary about her family.
Just through my crew!
What's the minimum payment in Morocco?
We should've arrived already.
I'm sorry.
Let's go talk in the other room.
I have to go there.
I heard Tom's getting married.
Tom didn't even know French when he first arrived in France.
Your flight has been cancelled.
I heard you talk to Tom.
Are you sisters?
I thought there was something weird.
Are you living here?
I can't find Tim.
I don't feel left foot.
What's in the kitchen?
I've got some training documentation.
I'll come with you.
Please sign here.
My father visited my uncle in the hospital.
That's it.
The soldiers refused to comply with the order.
I heard what happened to Tom.
You must know you're right in front of a crisis.
I don't have a ticket.
There are no English words in Tatoeba that contain the word "Lego".
Where's your school?
He's got no less than a hundred coins.
I have to find another one.
Take a test.
Am I invited?
I don't have any proof of that.
I love costumes.
He doesn't have children.
The young girl blew up in tears.
Are you John?
Your shoes are tied.
I'm lying late at night.
You decided that.
I think you're perfect.
The primary school will be mandatory.
In case of fire, use the stairs.
Are you satisfied, Tom?
I have faith in you.
Mary likes watching TV.
She's a friend.
We'll be together soon.
She's messing with you.
Why don't you follow me?
Tom and Mary had a middle-aged wedding.
We always wait patiently for Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love the kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to figure out who Tom is planning to give it to.
Incredible!
That's all you can really do.
It's time for us to take our "nursing."
France borders with Italy.
The simple numbers are like life, they're completely logical, but the rules for them can't be found, even give you all your time to think about them.
Her father made her tell him everything.
I worked this week all the time.
It's happening today.
I haven't seen Tom in a month.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
All you have to do is move the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom for a while.
Show us.
He's got nothing to do with it.
Do good to those who hate you.
I'm going to finish this project.
I'm just watching.
The teacher made him stay after school.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
As a last warning measure, I went up and fell into the shantytown.
I've never had such problems before.
His car is two years old.
I don't think Tom knows French.
It won't be that hard to convince Tom.
Tom bought a gift for his son.
If it were up to me, I wouldn't be interested in it.
I'm not jealous.
I have back problems.
They're gonna make parties for Sam.
Jane's the president's secretary.
The doctor took over the sick boy.
My French knowledge is not who knows what.
Who's the owner of this car?
You have to be careful.
Look back.
I'm not a traitor.
Tom was guilty of Mary's death.
The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
This meat is chicken.
I'm three years older than him.
I think it's OK.
What else is in your pocket?
There was no other place to go.
The man threw her away.
One of you'll make me happy.
I can't believe you still have confidence in Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting for a bad time.
I hear Boston was accepted at this time of the year.
What's your back?
Neither Tom, nor Mary is in the kitchen.
Growing prices provide consumers with the care they need.
I think you'll like Boston.
I heard every word.
Tom dressed his pajamas and got into bed.
He's not gonna make it.
I don't like the taste of subjects.
The girls from the province like to cut out dust and liquid flowers from the red paper and to paint them on doors and windows.

The airport was closed because of the mouse.
Tom's house was damaged by the floods.
Don't look at me with those sad eyes.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
You don't deserve much to talk about.
Tom said you're coming.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He himself refused to talk to her.
This painting is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that angered her.
That's too little.
I haven't seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was injured in the disaster.
The question now is, "How."
I like to speak French.
A wide range of hearings were being heard about the attack.
It's too short.
Stop going back to your famous days or stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What does it mean to be on time if everyone else is late?
The wind storm blew rain directly into my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be fine.
That's no problem.
Did you leave a kiss?
Looks like there's no one at home.
I'm gonna have to give up this request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?
What time is it?
Every time Mary smiles at him, Tom feels happy.
He has full confidence in traders.
These are the worst shoes I've ever seen.
I want some cheese.
He learns French every day.
I missed the event.
Your going here was a mistake.
I have one question for you.
Tom is absolutely safe.
I have a meeting with a student.
Panda is a national treasure in China.
If you don't, you're dead.
Tom's impulsive.
They won't bother you anymore.

I think you were right.
His uncle will take responsibility for him.
What's Tom's address?
These two roses are made of the same material.
I'm sure that won't work.
Did you write the house?
I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom doesn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
The cod's coming.
I intend to win.
Many of the kids were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a Hamal company to transfer things to a new address.
Will you tell me the way to the garage?
Tom wasn't new.
This guide may be of benefit to you on your journey.
Is your clock faithful?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like to be interested in gardening.
They've been drinking coffee for more than two hours.
It's a privilege to be here for me.
Is anyone here speaking French?
I think Tom should start dating other people besides Mary.
Mary just dropped the train.
Did you see Tom?
I made the first step.
Watch where you're going.
He looks like he's gone.
Tom took off his back and began to cut his hair off.
Maria's young and beautiful.
What about you?
It's not that simple.
I've never seen you here before.
Tom feels unfeeling among the strangers.
Number ten.
Tuiter's my account stopped because of my sleep.

Please, don't.
Start now.
In addition, many groups have been formed so that adults can socialize among themselves and remain active in American life.
How are you?
What are my other options?
I love a really hot egg.
I knew what was going on.
Don't forget me.
I heard you were looking for me.
I think I'm going to end up in spite of her disapproval.
Not all news can be bad.
We need help.
Don't they speak French?
You both look very young.
I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my portfolio.
Tom didn't have much time.
She read all my books herself.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I find out how confusing this is for you.
She hated him.
You're the boss!
Tom can also speak a little French.
I have to admit I was upset.
You don't look so happy to see me.
Can I open a condom?
Learning a foreign language is interesting.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared the list.
I don't lie anymore.
It's my brother's.
This dress costs money.
Tom cuts his hair.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look mad?
Tom speaks French.
How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We've arrived a little late.
Even if I lose my job, I can stay out of my savings.
It's ours. It's ours.
I have the same number of books as he has.
It's a bad rain yesterday.
I want to love you forever!
I think you should choose Tom.
I'll give you five bucks.
I think Tom's doing really well.
I'm a teacher.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
They were scared of the news.
My nose's broken.
I'm as strong as you.
Get in.
Tom says he's hungry.
I'm an old friend.
Is that your shirt?
Is it possible to fix the bridge?
People lived in the village before.
I want to be a teacher.
You're crazy about buying such a expensive bike.
I'm very lonely.
I've been waiting for a month.
Please explain the rules to me in the football.
That's a really stupid idea.
It was fun last night.
Are you happy?
Is there any water on Mars?
It's okay.
Tom won't be in the bank at this time.
I don't think you really want to do it.
You seem to have achieved a great success since the last time I saw you.
The garage's in the center of town.
You're not even working to come.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
So am I.
I don't like how you behave.
What are we doing here?
The object is out of the direction of this investigation.
You've been sitting in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you're coming.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost have no French books.
Even though I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget Tom doesn't understand French.
I'm planning on going there.
It's a beautiful red one on the front floor of my room.
I bet you're gonna be a great father.
Good night!
Someone has to go for help.
They say you play good on the band.
And you're a hero?
The prices have fallen lately.
When we're talking about travel, were you ever in Australia?
Tom speaks French relatively well.
I thought it was fun.
I've seen other people do it.
There were thirty witnesses.
He cursed her judgment.
I found the key under the trigger.
If I understand, they'll make a deal with us.
You don't have to figure out why, if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard your conversation with Tom.
It's a smaller problem.
Tom asked Mary to take the toothpaste and the toilet paper from the super.
You have to work hard.
I don't care about this hat.
What's the minimum payment in the UAR?
He's on the diet, because he's having a mild excess weight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You take something to drink, you break through with lattices to the Swedish table, and you eat like a pig!
These technical terms are from Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Keep the rocket safe.
When I went home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were dating Tom seriously.
They won't worry about you anymore.
I don't hate it.
I don't give lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need some rest.
Tom's excited.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a linguist.
I'd like to find my account.
I heard you talk.
We became friends right away.
Tom spent the weekend in his beach house.
Your black one's gone.
You know everything about me.
Let me think a little and I'll get in touch with you.
They're interesting people.
Please, call me from time to time.
Tom checked his pants' pockets.
Hold on to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your evaluations.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's really wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much wheat does this field grow?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
You're right, you're wrong.
Will you give me a fire?
He drinks his coffee every time.
I don't have any information about Tom.
She found a job as a mechanic.
Leave me alone.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should've worked harder.
Her powder is lily.
Now that I'm registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they actually imagine they are capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a field.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
Yesterday was a terrible cold.
I forgot to give him the message.
I've finished American literature in college.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
We were wrong about the stress.
I think you'll be happy.
The teenagers left.
I want to be rich.
I've just started.
If you need anything, just call me.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought the kid's toys.
I didn't get an answer from you.
She had her hair cut out in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to take his keys with his legs.
His teaching method is good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
Everything I want is you.
I'm looking for a little cup of coffee.
He became a witness to the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that there was nothing to do with the matter.
I love the party.
This is the camera I bought yesterday.
The fields are no longer in fashion.
I think we'll need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it again.
That's what I think.
Many museums don't work Monday.
They invited Tom to the hospital to change his stomach because he ate something poison.
Don't make me do it.
You're sitting in my place.
Oh, my God!
Your green goes away.
I bet you know French.
For dinner Tom took Mary to a seaside restaurant.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis tonight.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sashayama?
Everything Tom told me was a lie.
What's going to be tomorrow?
Do you have any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way we can hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like making photos.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a donor.
The girls were dancing in the salon.
She's convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house and saw another town.
You won't see anything without a fan.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit I'm crying.
We've been using this insecticide for 2 years.
Come and help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus came empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice girl.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to leave the meeting.
Tom cut his hair and then put his back on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, because she's good at everything.
Ken plays football every day.
Tell me again at any time.
I don't want tea, but coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Would you wait outside?
Can you eat hard drinks?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train went 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact disc.
The director considered the possibility to fire Tom, but he decided not to.
I've got to cut him off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do it.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is this possible to be love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two children.
The police don't have to take bribes.
I was on the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers in southern Germany will see farms with solar panels where they can look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard a phone call.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was mad that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I was wrong about your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
They all jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the holidays.
Why should I learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We thank you for your help.
Since we wear clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's start.
He's visiting his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average growth.
I found the key.
I know it's important.
My sister, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any prayers.
Natalie Tom, I don't know him so well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
This part is true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have shoes, but I don't have shoes.
Fuck.
She's my name, Kenji.
I have the information you wanted.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national characteristics.
Flooding is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget to feed the dog.
I have to study things.
I'll see you.
I've never wanted to be an astrophysicist.
Tom's got blood back.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red ring.
Do you want me to cut it down a little?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really couldn't make it without you.
I'm not mad at you. I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
With my younger sister at the same time you left?
The game was suspended for an unknown time.
His brother taught him a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Did you see Tom?
I want to be taller.
Do many people visit museums?
The thieves stole the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's going to speak French from the inside.
Tom helped Mary wear her coat.
That book about caboccos could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He lay down on his lattices.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom that he's opposed.
What's the minimum payment in New Zealand?
I'm saving him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes a lot.
His empty attempts to upset her showed him that he was wrong; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything he just told you.
We're relatives.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a date with him for dinner.
In the invitation, he wrote that there will be puppies and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
Give me that to help.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the souls?
Mike runs very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European health insurance card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur deserves a visit.
I couldn't make them understand me.
And you speak French?
I've just started learning French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
One boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the mail.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's sleeping.
Are these explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
There's no sisters.
Tom has small hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women, homes.
Where's the toilet?
They usually come back before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I can't take Tom to the bridge.
If I were in your place, I'd ask for this job.
The patient was written by the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We need to keep working.
Hurry up, we'll be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was amazed by her opera song.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists arrived.
The door's shut and shut.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
They look like their neighbors.
Don't talk to Tom.
I don't understand the smile.
I'm afraid you know him.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat this if you loved it?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the unassessed version?
Given how long he's been studying French, I should be able to speak better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy rice?
I think you have the right to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's holiday.
You're not the only ones there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends with happiness.
I'm sick of myself.
This is done manually by Tom.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
You don't wear a lot of bags when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They're both working.
Tom didn't come here well.
I'm sorry she lied to her.
It doesn't make sense to go crazy, you know she's playing games with you.
George's very excited about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given advantage to the others.
I noticed you.
Take it with you.
Just wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
He's playing for me in public.
The hole's burning.
Tom was working very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Put it down.
What do you say we're having dinner together?
I think he lied to me.
That's incredible.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I made at Tomova's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all agreed that Tom could speak French.
Tom came back in.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This rice needs to be removed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel good.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I'm thinking through vacation to learn to swim.
Where's the beach?
Are Jantes playing tonight?
I have the feeling that he won't let me get away so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a while.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's a bitch.
The beach is near here.
Ken crossed the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
One of you'll make me happy.
When are you going?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right to the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He's lost his last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait.
I completely removed you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Are you thinking French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum payment in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
Whoever's winding, he's gonna hit the storm.
According to data from the last census, the total population of the country is a little over 7 million people.
Time-bound measures will not have any effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left my keys.
On the other hand, did you finally hear from him?
A death sentence.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I have nothing.
At least once he's thinking about his head.
I figured you could be hungry.
That's the beginning of a new age.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about this a couple of times.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you get up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We should have respected their request.
Choose the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so lie down early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to suggest.
I'm talking to my French officers.
It's my sister's photo.
Tom finds it difficult to deal with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so tense that I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He must love you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to feel well.
Did the back go too?
I promise to bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a scarf.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
What do you say we study in the library together?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in force.
There's a button missing on your hair.
I need to get out for a while.
Your green goes.
Push your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom used to work on the open.
Tom pressed down.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Is he playing tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
They're in this store with kitchen benefits.
I think he made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is nice.
Please give me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be here.
How are you doing?
I've had a good time.
I'll stay by Tuesday.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Did any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start to smell snow.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never sailed on top of Fuggy.
You're not playing golf, are you?
Tom's not working anymore.
It probably doesn't matter.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What's the minimum payment in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debates.
Eat one live apple every morning and the rest of the day will not be worse for you.
Tom won't be interested in seeing you.
The unemployment is growing.
I couldn't move last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's laughing.
If you're going to France, you have to warn France.
I understand what you're saying.
I've never had confidence in Tom.
I'm teaching French at school.
That's what he said.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please be patient.
Your shirt's getting too far.
I've been through a lot today.
Christopher Columb was drinking unfiltered sea water.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
Everybody's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseballist.
Tom wanted to be unconnected.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
My uncle gave me an hour.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week, I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring him back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have a girlfriend?
You're obviously wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he wrote something.
Do you want some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I've opened my check.
He was here this time.
I put my shoes right away.
He feels uncomfortable with his father's presence.
Your shoes are broken.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took his coat off.
I can swim in the river.
Do you care about French every day?
Don't raise that noise, please.
You're quite good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to eat.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
I wouldn't have said no.
That's amazing.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personally with you.
He was transported to the helicopter hospital.
When Tom woke up, he found that Mary was missing.
She's a hairdresser.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony last night.
Jill's married to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In Spanish, the actuals end with "o". A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Can't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student of my class.
I'm buying tapes.
We'll need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come on, come on.
Will you tell me something about yourself?
Jane has serious problems.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a soul in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I'll take your offer.
What's the minimum payment in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get back?
I wash my clothes.
I heard French is a hard language.
I haven't been fed at all.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up and lie down.
Come on, touch him.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years did you learn French?
Carol came back to her hotel.
Do you like this color?
Please, be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The planet is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
Get out of the train.
Mary's leaving with two at the same time.
There's no memory of Tom yet.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was awake in five hours.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can contact the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom put too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll put more effort into it.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is mixed with joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got boxing hair.
I'll meet you in the park.
I've never won before.
It's a little late.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
You want them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your favor.
Tom ran the check to see if there's any chemicals he can use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We went out after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I want to be young.
Be more accurate.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't time great?
I don't mind.
I don't want to belong to Elita at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to learn hard.
I'll be back soon.
I'm asking Tom.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let him talk to Tom.
He was playing football with an empty conservatory.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a powder under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has had good results.
That's what his ignorance is.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are those criminals?
Can you take six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll set up a sorry party for him.
What club do you belong to?
Asushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading again and again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He's finished Cambridge with a difference.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom teach French at school?
What shoes do they make?
We definitely did our best to be healthy.
I'll take my trip to Scotland while it's warm.
He began to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay by tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I made at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better in this.
My father's going to run every morning.
I saw Tom walk through the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave up all her balls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
You go.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't want my money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a website, just be careful not to break someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful church.
The fingers of the hand are five: pallet, indicator, middle finger, anonymous and square.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've done my job with the cure.
Has anyone noticed that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, though, I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
Up-down how much does a taxi get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're totally right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have a lot of English books.
We have time till tomorrow morning.
I like your rice.
Enthusiast began his worthy respect for the beginning.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, his local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more precise.
I'm a vacation this week.
You're out of your pockets.
I promise I won't do that again.
I just gave you blood.
He knows neither French nor German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm a bitch.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you tell me your name if you loved it?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Do you see the game?
This is your house.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it's time to leave.
She cooks every morning.
Don't forget to celebrate tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Oh, that's terrible.
It doesn't make my eyes nice.
I don't have any money.
Honey's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom wasn't used to living in town.
Keep Tom under eye.
Jane's out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I can't go.
The long fields now are democracies.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, I stopped playing snow and the time went up.
She did not do particularly cures for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
Learn French every day.
I heard every word.
Where'd you get your hats?
Let's go to a movie.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What do we get?
Keep him secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't hope so much.
What's the price of this sugar?
Mom, will you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
She can't be the way you're walking around. You're starting to abuse people's addresses.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I fell into a coma, and I couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom made a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been a long time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you a fool.
I speak French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not so bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word supports when you fall, it's worth more than an hour of praise when you've made it.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His rice was mixed with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You're not going to be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I've done it on Ankull.
What's up, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
History is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was clean.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom's gift.
One thing is sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom's been told he's got cancer soon enough.
Tom got off the bus.
For me, a meeting last night is a better option.
What are you gonna do?
Tom learned French three hours ago.
Raise your hand.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I often travel.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's share the prize at fifty-five.
Put my hand down.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think it's better to get down.
I haven't seen Tom since he was born here.
I need to know.
Do you like traveling?
Your plan is broken.
Tom made a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished my lunch.
I have to go and help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting was going to be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get to the bus.
Are you coming, or are you not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the proposal.
He's not talking about people behind their back.
She's reached an age of age.
Come with me to take a walk.
I'll be happy to see the movie.
Whoever's well prepared, he doesn't care.

Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on which the buried bubbles live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I got news about Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
Put me in pain.
I tried everything I knew.
Why do people fear her?
He's been fighting the hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's just started to recover.
The whole thing is a mistake.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they get sick before they get sick.
I wouldn't have thought the tofu was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
So what does it mean?
I haven't had my college yet.
He asked you to help him.
I was only in Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm sorry about the weddings.
I can't do it on my own.
You're right.
If you tell her about this, then she will tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell her best friends and finally everyone will understand.
It was cold on her.
Tom speaks with a French accent.
I've never seen a needle.
Ken can swim, can't he?
Tom and Mary went to the moonpark.
I decided it's best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you see it carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door if you love it.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
It's the sweetest quarter I've ever seen.
I'm not bad.
In this restaurant, food's good.
I don't care.
Are they wrong?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
They're creating you out of work.
I have to take my son at 2:30.
The sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a big hit.
The prices have finally fallen.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to pull me off?
If you're late for the transfer of control, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I'm not living with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I can't take Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where are we going?
You can't worry about it.
I stole the cat for the door.
Looks like he'll win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There's been a lot of frog in this lake.
I understand it very well.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read French, right?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's hungry?
The girl eats bread.
I love the buyers.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you that dress.
I heard him go down the stairs.
A friend will come to the guest tomorrow.
I hope this will happen.
Maybe Mrs. Satou sent the flowers.
Get us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to get to Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why'd you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll be there!
I'm afraid I've touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's lost his life.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put these glasses on, if you like.
I heard it was good.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's with Russian hair.
I don't know when he's coming.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll learn French in the next semester.
Tom won't make a word today.
I'll see you tonight!
I'm done with my money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing's ever going to happen like you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a ring?
Children should be subject to their parents.
Is there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come in on Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
No one raised the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning Spanish.
My new bike costs 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep him down later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so proud.
I have wonderful news.
Looks like it's snowing, isn't it?
That's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel fell because of the earthquake of the previous day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the damn door!
We played for him.
John came a week ago.
He rejected the proposal, too.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
I'm sorry, I have a request.
The brat is a man who cuts the beards and shakes the hair of men.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
Not all of us are so stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you're slow and patient.
Tom started learning French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around.
Tom liked to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't sleep on the ground.
I think we can handle it better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not wrong.
I'm the most common office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be here in time.
He often walks to school.
The wolves are freezing.
When are you gonna get married?
It's a phase.
He's off the train.
You're cruel.
How many episodes have you seen on Wuan Pice?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that a big difference?
You can make photos outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're sweet and sweet.
My sister lives in Yokohama.
I think you should do the deal.
It wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her tennis.
Hey, man, I'm begging you a lot. Go on with a little insecticide behind the refrigerator.
She told me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is improving.
It's your turn.
Put another cup of coffee in the bag.
Soon after that, I started to cry.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permission.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're satisfied.
When the conversation ends, he says a friendly greeting and wants me to have a nice evening.
Let's check it out.
So far, he's done a good job.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't fix it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him.
I got a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them out?
As usual, the physical teacher is late for the hour.
Let me explain what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my place.
I've already tried that way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students don't have to use this toilet.
You've come into the winning series.
I want to drink something.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for another, except to take care of the baby.
It's nice to meet you too.
The film wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.
I don't think Tom's number is in the indicator.
Can you do it on your own?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
I'll be with her after dinner.
These containers are closed thermally.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's no one.
I want more detailed information.
Are you wearing a gun?
He says he avoided danger by retracing himself to the dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Watch out for her.
Don't shoot.
Isn't that amazing?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You need to learn harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He's trapped in a house.
I came later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was scared.
I was your mother's first friend.
The quarantine broke our unit.
How much money do I have to take with me?
Tom lives with French.
I'm falling for stories like that.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just selling.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these bastards?" - "To my sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, strong blonde.

I'll be home soon.
He was on his way to work.
I had a little temperature this morning.

Is that the right direction for the museum?
The school starts at eight and a half.
It happens twice.
Deep breath is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We were wrong to worry about you.
He can't read.
You're doing pretty well.
The arguments won't solve anything.
Maybe it's a mistake.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and memory of the new words.
I think they know us.
I don't intend to hurt you.
Can you meet me with a doctor who speaks French?
Are you sleeping?
Our team was with red flannels.
How about a beach trip?
These dogs are big.
You all say "sirene."
Tom won't pay for it.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the stairs to school, and in both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.

Aren't you coming?
I'll stay for dinner.
I forgot her name.
I think you'll be happy.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Then where's the problem?

It's business.
Please close the safe.
She stopped me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.

I like your hair.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?

Parents often make sacrifices to provide good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's hungry.
You're going to London next week, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't mind that.

I need to teach Tom about it.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumps through the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.

You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She's eating apples.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the shop.
Are you good enough?
Why don't you take a check for every case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm not right.
Are you finished with the breakfast?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.

I talked to him about it on the phone.

How can I find you?

I don't want to work under these conditions.
Don't punish Tom for this.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom noticed three points.
Do you like walking along the beach?
When are you leaving?
Is there anyone with you?
Tom can't believe what's going on.
Does he have fun last night?
It's said right, he's wrong.
They're already here.
You're sitting in the kitchen alone.
I'm coming back.
When do I close the museum of art?

Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom's gonna stay for a week.
I'm looking for a present for my father.
The problem doesn't deserve to be discussed.
It was quite cold.
"For here or home?" - "For here, thank you."

Anyway, you'll never understand.
Believe it or not, dust and bandages are from one family.

I don't know what to do next.
There's no rain from the morning.
There's a hole in my teeth.
Tom's doing great.
He's really speaking well.

They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where to go.
I don't have personal space.
We have something for you.

Your French has improved significantly.
What's in your suitcase?
We'll get married by the end of March.
He raised his hand.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I wish you luck.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He's married to a good girl.
I took care of it.
Aren't you interested?
That's something quite different.
His brother, his sisters, or he himself will go to the garage to meet his father.

The snow was up to the knees.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to see Tom asking for money on the street after he lost all his cash in the garage.
I've never seen anything like that before.
You're not gonna be the only ones there.
Do you understand me?
Are you speaking Turkish?
I put it in your room.
No one's home.
He still wants to come.
We have to cancel the honor.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom do there?
I think it's Tom.
That's exactly what I said that could happen, that's what happened.

Good day.
I think that's gonna be interesting.

I know you're right.
I've never eaten Chinese food.
Aren't you married?
I told Tom everything about Mary.
The baby looked just like his mother.
I don't want to sell the soul of the devil.
Who do you like more, the coke or the pessie?
Tom had his education at home.
My father's here.
He took out his passport.
Tom opened another glass of his tea.
Tom doesn't realize how his behavior affects others.
He's the man who's headed for perfume marketing.
Now she laughed at them.
You have sympathetic eyes.
Don't move.
It's a little bit of a book.
Lucy likes to play tennis.
It's something I just have to do.
We missed the event.
Tom put his wallet on the desk.
This book is too hard for me.
Don't push me!
Tom's eyes are a son.
I'm watching TV.
I'm sure she's right.
Will you take care of it?
I have no idea where she lives.
Are these books on Kenji?
We're men.
How's it going with this camera?
Don't smoke in the toilet.
Do you have an elevator in your house?
Do you have this new book?
Tom, are these yours?
Let's go?
He'll be back soon.
Two places for a common buffet, if you like.
I think Tom's gonna win.
It's a shame, Ken.
Are you going or not?
I think we should wait.
My parents would have finished eating before I got home.
I forgot the book.
We taste inside.
Tom couldn't believe what was going on.
My favorite team lost yesterday.
I'm tired.
I've got important news.
They all knew Tom.
Tom and Mary speak French.
I made coffee.
Tom didn't say what he was planning to do.
Tom's over three decades old.
I heard you talk to Tom.
I'm just a little excited.
Give it to me!
Tom's always taken.
I wouldn't blame you.
It's completely absurd.
How did you figure this out?
Shut up and listen.
The doctors found some shooting facts.
I'm glad to meet you.
We had no choice but to wait for her.
Are you sure you don't want some?
It's almost ten hours.
Tom told me he might have heard something, but he wasn't sure what it was.
Are you the new assistant?
I think you're really surprised.
If I miss the train, I'll catch the bus.
Do you really want to swim?
Dropping the trigger can be dangerous.
I'm not a teacher.
He slept well last night.
Don't you have to go?
Don't you think it would happen to Tom to let Mary drive the car?
I'll get him back where he is.
Tom's gone.
She asked me if I'd be free next week.
They're calling me Bob.
Last week we saw a funny movie.
This flower is the most beautiful of all flowers.
No one knew how much Tom loved Mary.
He'll be here soon.
She allowed me to use her dictionary.
He asked me a question.
I've seen him before.
Our car broke down last night.
I didn't even get a letter from her.
I think you need help.
I think Tom was born in Boston.
Why did he take it?
Tom told me he knew where Mary lived.
I think you need a dream.
Will you sing?
I'm not excited about what's going to happen.
I need to help my mother.
Tom thinks I'm right.
He learns French in three hours every day.
Do you know him at all?
"I won't let you hurt my friends!" "I didn't hesitate to hurt your friends."
I'm sleeping with two johns in the winter.
Many English words come from Latin.
We met them in the youth society.
I like to write in French.
Tom thought Mary was free, but she wasn't quite sure.
Is she still here?
That's what happened when I met her personally.
What could have happened to Tom?
Everything's fine, just like Tom predicted.
Can I sit next to you?
You can walk.
I think what Tom did was very brave.
I'm not gonna be able to take Tom through the bridge.
Why don't they come?
That's the worst possible.
You're making a serious mistake.
How long are you going to the market?
Tom first noticed Mary's musical gift.
Would you help me translate this?
I'm waiting for your help.
Einstein used to play a bike.
Tom can't handle this.
You have beautiful hands.
I'm learning English hard.
I've been waiting for a month.
There's something I need to show you.
They need some direction.
I told you what to do.
It depends on you.
Do you understand me?
Let the power be with you!
After dinner, I wrote the house.
No one's gonna know.
What's the minimum payment in Lebanon?
Tom was found guilty and sentenced to death.
It's nothing serious.
Let's speak English.
What day is it today?
Tom can't stay long, so let the meeting begin.
Let's go to hell.
I saw Tom play guitar with his group.
All their efforts were empty.
Oh, my God, I'm late for lessons.
I made a healthy breakfast.
He often wrote to his parents.
As a result of heavy alcoholism, he lost his health.
Both plans were rejected.
If the vote had changed something, they'd have canceled it.
I have problems with German grammar.
Wow, isn't that great?
You don't have to surrender.
The camp is fighting at eight.
Stop being so jealous.
I kept singing.
That's cool.
I got a dog in my eye.
It wasn't that hard.
You've got to die.
Did you actually try?
We heard about Tom earlier.
I met Tom last night.
Mary came to the hospital.
This may be of interest to you.
Wait a minute.
He likes coffee without sugar.
I see the light.
It looks like you're right, actually Tom stole Mary's cigarette.
Yeah, that's right.
I've got an old bike.
Tom won't be able to drive for a while.
It was starting to smell snow.
I like to take care of the garden.
The plants were dried up because they weren't pollinated.
My parents were fed before I came home.
Tom's mom Mary all the time.
My expenses are increasing every year.
She's been spending more than half an hour, squabbling her wings!
I wore my favorite dress for the party.
They fixed it.
All delegates knew they had to discuss it.
Thank you again.
I left the door open.
Tom told me good things about you.
This land belongs to Tom.
Isn't that your rice?
I think you should listen to Tom.
I don't think anyone's reading my blog.
Do you still think you're gonna like the job?
Let's catch it.
I love the instrument music.
I barely got it.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
I've already written my homework.
What does a consultant study?
"Thank you." "No reason."

Did you know Tom left town?
Where can we eat?
This rose is beautiful.
I had to pay more attention to what Tom was saying.
Stop digging.
The world is facing the problem of freezing the environment.
It's excellent to say that Rome wasn't built for one day.

Tom's finally acting weird.
How many years did you learn French?
Take it easy.
Tom parked in front.
Is there a public beach near here?
I've never heard Tom speak French.
Are you ready for the game?
In most cases modernization is slowed down with vesterization.
I don't remember his name.
She's beautiful with girls' cards, so the whole shirt was shining.
How was the beach?
I've got these flowers myself.
They went to the park the next morning.
Don't look at me like that!
It's great to meet you.
I was surprised Tom was speaking French so well.
Don't go out with Tom.
Where's your father?
Are you sure?
If I were younger, I'd go abroad to learn.
I'd like you to translate this report into French.
Mysa was very nice, so make my car free.
Please drive carefully.

We got some interesting information.
I told you everything I can remember.
They don't pay me for it.
Take it easy.

How much do you owe Tom?
I don't think that's gonna happen.

You'll find her.
Both motorcycles wore helmets.
If we're supposed to be fair, he's not jealous.

Let me take you to your room.

I'll get off the train on the next stop.
Get out of here.
I think you should wear a ring.
And I can't do it.

No, I want to pay in number.
Is it over with the house?
I hear Tom was very good at swimming.

Tom can't cook.

All I ever wanted was to be left alone.
How many times did Tom call?
I was surprised Tom was speaking French so well.
It was you, wasn't it?

Whatever I say, it won't make Tom change his decision.
I don't understand German at all.
Are these real?
I really didn't think it would be here.
I'll invite Mary out.
Can I ask who you are?
You're kidding!
I told you everything you need to know.
I haven't given up yet.
It doesn't matter.
We don't have that much time.
Tom was laughing at Mary's jokes.

The boy quickly got used to his new class.
What money do you have?

That's a delicate question.

It's an imitation.
Let's get a picture of it.
I'll meet you at my house.
I haven't started anything yet.
I'll take my car.
These are my pants.

You have a lot of books.
We don't have to break our promise.
It seems Tom likes to just sit at the dock and watch the teas.
We played tennis yesterday.
The choice of an exemplary expression was not good.

Tom and Mary got married three years after they first met.
I want a room from the back.
That's terrible.
Tom and Mary like to let go of the landmarks.
It's not from me.
I missed the last train.
Aren't you having fun?
I think you're in danger.
No one likes me, I've never been liked because I'm not beautiful.
Which country are you born?
Every time I look for you, you don't.
Of the twenty students only one read the book.
I'll call you back later.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
Aren't you nervous?
Let's sing some French songs together.
One of his hats was wrong.
I hope it's over.
Birds sing.
At least it turns out you're happy to see me.
What's the minimum payment in Iceland?
I'm better than you.
You won't believe what I found.
Don't!
Prior to initiation of this type of therapy, the patient's wishes should be taken into account.
I think you should call Tom.
Are you sure you want to burn those documents?
I found a note on my desk, but I don't know who it is.
You have time till midnight.
Your file is in me.
No one's ever telling me anything here.
I gave every gift.
The museum doesn't work on Sunday.
Your answer is wrong.
She remembers Mr. Black's car.
They put Tom in jail.
My mother feels better.
Tom just got home.
Don't expose him to rain.
They're talking very fast.
What time is it now?
Can I have this protocol?
Mary loves romantic comedies.
What are they drinking?
Let's be friends.
As far as I know, he must be born in Italy.
"But really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I need to meet Tom.
Even though Tom's English sometimes seems pretty good, he doesn't have a clue where his options are extended and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he's wrong.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you fight with Tom.
Will you call me back?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is the best friend of man, inside the dog is too dark to read.
It's okay.
My mother made a very sympathetic part.
You need to start right now.
It's an old letter.
Are you taking part in some public activity?
Do you care?
Apparently, Tom was known before he published this album.
The Romans would have no chance of ruling the world if they had first been required to learn Latin.
I paid $50.
Don't drink that.
I think it's best to get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table now!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
The bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit that he doesn't know how to do it.
Only I know them.
They've been in this town for 350 years.
I'm playing a television game.
He was in Japan.
Let's split up with one suit.
Are you still getting mail marks?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year's import exceeded the export price.
You don't have a temperature.
Did someone tell you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happened.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What would a man do like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting, turning her back into the tree.
Thank you, we'll give our best.
Let's get up and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes are good for you.
I've been studying French for three years.
I think you should go out now.
Please, go.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom looks really happy.
I've never heard Tom speak French before.
She's a French girl.
Soldiers are used to danger.
I know a little French.
Please enter your contact address here.
Nice appetite!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
Are you gonna make it?
The police found a body thrown to the beach right away from here.
We all speak French.
The Lord knows best the value of his own life.
I appreciate that you came to take me.
Check if you've turned off the TV before you're asleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about your life.
It's time for you to make things right, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
Corridor's a liar. Watch out.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slovenian roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that to your parents.
Let's say things honestly!
She's the woman I gave her.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This is a funny situation.
This land is Tom's.
I think you should meet Tom.
Don't add annotations.
No one's got it yet.
Your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He played well on the guitar.
Have you played Maincraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medicines right now?
The tree's burning.
I heard every word he said to you.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We were getting ready to ride.
Can I take your coat?
My dad's gonna make my breakfast tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just shut down the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I'm guessing you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you've had a hard day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to know what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept recording.
They're working less teenagers today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please, don't.
Tom's pool isn't very beautiful, but it's clear.
Shoichi's face is cold.
An electric current can generate magnetic field.
Would you mind if I included the radio?
I have to do different things tomorrow.
The bullet was split into dust and dust.
America is very big.
I heard him stop the car.
Follow her my greetings.
Is your wife a blonde, or is she a blonde?
I'm out, I'm driving my car.
The men took the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to understand what they're saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can I trust her?
This is the camera Tom made with the photos.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your Christmas plans?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given a chance.
Would you put your shoes in your pocket?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
My new magazine is very interesting.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a trip with hope.
I'll be here.
I don't care.
I think you're really surprised.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the hat.
Tell Tom to explain it to you.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird.
Can you do it on your own?
It's getting longer in spring days.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father sing in the bathroom.
In Singapore, English is spoken.
I'm eating bread.
That request was rejected.
It was the right thing to do.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do what I say.
The kids are already dead.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The hole's burned.
I need to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I'll always remember your goodness.
This smell and I've felt it another time.
Everyone's dying.
I don't understand.
Give me a kiss.
He hates to sell.
I think you're gonna be good enough.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a booky red.
I think you're capable of everything.
He protested against her plan.
I don't think we should.
You're not gonna be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than you need.
It's a known mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still in school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
Either you or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell evil.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I was there only once.
Put your jacket on the locker to the door.
Tom lives on three cuts from the coast.
He's something of little significance.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave him for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The film wasn't as funny as the book.
I didn't get the job.
I think you're perfect.
All human beings are part of the whole, called the universe - part, limited in time and space. It takes its own thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion for his consciousness. This illusion is a personal prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to be freed from this prison, expanding the circle of our co-operation so that it covers all living creatures and nature throughout the universe and beauty.
No doubt he'll come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Should I fill in this form in French?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became the director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like it.
What's this thing?
Never give a dog's food to your cat.
I have problems with French grammar.
I put it through my face.
I'll love you.
You won't believe it.
Should I open it?
Now it's totally different.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in bright.
Betty killed him.
Did you start learning French now?
You can't read French, can you?
Your blouse is going very well with this part.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask me later.
He's my older brother.
She became famous.
She rejected his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll be very interested.
I didn't insult you to stupid.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that upsets me.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Tom lives far from here?
Bad time didn't allow me to leave.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
They've got my legs on my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and take a cup of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to understand Tom when he thinks he's leaving.
She's reading the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks about changing the world itself.
She wants to get divorced.
You have to learn hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard the shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an uncomfortable position.
Who translated this for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and relax, you'll feel a lot better.
Are you done with the breakfast?
I have a few old computers.
Tom wondered where Mary was after her childhood.
Are you coming, or are you not?
Are you talking Georgian?
And Tom, and Mary took out their weapons.
Do the cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stayed.
Tom was tired.
You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a blouse that's coming up on this couch.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You always complain.
It's dark.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's love must be forgotten.
My brother told me he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have to make a few calls.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you like to close that window?
The old couple went on a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was left all day long.
My math is my favorite object.
What day do you usually feel?
Tom came back to take his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom came home all over the cave.
Did you actually try?
Burya stopped flying.
Tell me you have good news.
What browser are you using?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum payment on your side?
I think you should think about it again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you gonna get - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I'm basically running every corner.
The phone rang in eight hours.
Mr. Smith was accused of breaking the contract.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked.
Are you sleeping, baby?
She's giving birth marks.
Five gallons are normal, if you like.
I haven't been here a lot.
Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Are you speaking German?
Put your coat on.
I bought some books from the library.
Get used to it.
Last night it became a terrible crime.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste your time.
Why are you here so early?
If you're judging on your great thin, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It'll probably be snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was an art museum in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
His luck will end sooner or later.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
And there are no sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time he was traveling on a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can't make money from the bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
Honey, if the dinner isn't ready by seven o'clock, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll be right back.
They made us work all night.
He likes English.
I understand about your party.
They need to change their attitude.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the garden.
What's the minimum payment in Russia?
He loves me.
Try to figure out when the train goes.
You need to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there again.
It's a big stupid thing for you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and grew up in Tokyo.
I'm doing my job.
She's waiting until the water closes before she makes tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
It's not likely they're coming in this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months, it would make us all speak French without interference.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one's talking about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived last night with the train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Choose your favorite rocket.
I'll kiss you with sushi.
Let's do it for today.
My brother claims he's not afraid of the dark.
Save the man, eat the cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want to help?
Tom speaks French awfully.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
Do you want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please, give me a ticket.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was on his way to leave when the phone rang.
He asked about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His brain's gone too far.
Ann's a majoret.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Look carefully at the map of the wall.
Maybe not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll be very interested.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
I haven't had a soul in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a table, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your hair.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Go straight on the way and pass the candle, you're there.
Do as you please.
Some people would probably ask, why don't we just collect things and get out of Afghanistan?
You'll kill your cats if you love them.
I don't have ammo.
I'd like to get your picture.
Please, get him back.
"What's your car brand?" "Ford."
I tried to be your friend.
His second cousin was a member of the Jewish Governing Council.
Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Have you seen Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't talked to Tom in three weeks.
Stop sneezing.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you're wrong.
He couldn't stand awake all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people are impatient to travel by sea.
My plane left in six hours.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
It's a street.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you're not gonna be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a letter.
Uncle gave me your car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his bag on.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else is done.
I need to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night the game was exciting.
The shirts are the last piece of fashion.
Don't lose.
With a little good will from both sides, our problems should be solved.
I don't have much money.
She jumped out of the stairs fast.
The house we used to live in is free.
I'll be married next week.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In the gym, my French was my favorite object.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the candle, if you like.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why don't you laugh?
Have you ever greeted Pfrsichbäumchen in German?
It happened.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this investigation.
Isn't it good?
I don't know French, but Greek is entirely.
He made it clear that he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I sleep so much?
She answered through tears.
When are you going?
Hanako grew up taller than her mother.
That's quite different.
The elephant is dry.
He's learning French homes.
Don't raise that noise, please.
Did any of you ever see Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is married and we want to fix our heads.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you going to eat this box?
I worked hard in the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talk.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This may seem a little overwhelming.
Looks like our water's over.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green one's coming to Alice.
We're meeting three times a week.
They caught the knife in a trap.
You've got it.
You love the kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, if you like.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's already one hundred.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you learning French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I need to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a deodorant.
When I wake up, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to do this.
You don't look too surprised.
That's a warning we need to take seriously.
What's the tape saying?
We should have gone to one and a half.
Let's get my jackets.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is used to speaking French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have good hands.
People as a whole are against war.
Your hair needs to be raised.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's book?
It's never gonna end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who the fuck hurt you?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You sat in my place.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
I teach French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about yourself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was three decades old.
Her hobby is to collect mail marks.
I have nothing.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than we could hear, they would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I've got your coat.
Last night we had a great time.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often leads me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Aren't you scared of something?
He didn't know anything about him since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I washed my hands in my pockets .
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a big musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you ever heard of your sister?
Everybody's hungry.
She's down the stairs.
I was alone, I learned.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think it's better to sit down.
Our sales are falling.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid for the accident, please send the debt and let us remove the problem immediately.
He smelled like a toilet here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was saved by an accident passer.
The city is in the center of town.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
It's very nice of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story was interesting.
What are you gonna say to stop the car and get off?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little late for eleven without a quarter.
And both factors are correct.
I haven't seen the darkness before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book was never translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep that night.
Rund's been around five minutes.
He used to be in the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who left the dogs?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, and I can't talk about it.
I'll give it all to myself.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike's swimming very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle looked at him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I need to warn him.
Where's the garage?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't lie.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've got a big knife.
You scared the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches me to arrange flowers.
What a beautiful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll be interested.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
It's hard to get English.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a condom?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is the place Tom was born.
Where are you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea what's going on.
You're all stupid.
They exchange gifts.
I have nothing against myself.
Mr. Colkot's Japanese food began to like him.
I put the money in the safe.
Let's go.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to focus on this fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Would you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's a little unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix it.
I went to swim in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know either guy or other guy.
Guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna be raining.
I was extremely happy!
This isn't your house.
I haven't seen anything.
Hey, I just came here.
I'm a hero.
Damn it!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Let's have the heat under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes in the control.
It's time for me.
Aren't you happy?
We can take some time.
I thought you could get away with it.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, the car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this powder?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy laughed happy.
He's only four minutes from here with a train.
What's Tom trying to achieve?
Can anyone believe you?
It's a little fat.
It's better to leave.
Tom said we probably won't take too much time.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, take care of the rest!
I would never hurt them.
I learned French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you under pressure?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
The children should listen to their parents.
It's moving today.
Are you living in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of everything.
He came home after he had been away for ten months.
We'll be in Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's get started here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll get the next bus.
Tom's two times older than Mary.
Mary has two boys.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not so tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the results.
Hurry up and you'll be able to catch your car.
You're not gonna need that anymore.
Get him back where you got him.
Let's start.
I missed you.
Tom found Mary stealing money from the casino.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little tired.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So it's still working.
Can you do it on your own?
She's exhausted.
Are you so stupid about me?
If you give someone $20 and you never see him again, it's probably worth it.
This is Jane's bag.
Tom's always laughing.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum payment in India?
Don't make a decision on this matter today.
She didn't have much money.
You've been sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two risks are made by the same material.
Are you learning French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year, we're going to study in college.
What are you eating, fish or meat?
I made my check.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What does Ken do now?
There's a lot of DNA statements, but there's not one for the DNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't lie to your nose.
The wind blew on the storm.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter's married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his students.
Of the twenty students only one read the book.
I've got a job on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the courage to rely on confirmed authorities.
I came home with a train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you do?
What was the name of the one you went out with before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to sleep early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He's supposed to be the school director.
I bet I'll get there before you.
He was supposed to be a clown.
She's my girlfriend.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs, and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no television or radio in those days.
She went to the cab museum.
Look at your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These bastards have holes on the fives.
Tom likes to fly.
You're a good doctor.
You haven't repeated that word any more.
I saw him stop.
She felt that her knees were shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him sometime.
He wasn't so strong.
What a strong wind!
This is my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's out with a group of kids he doesn't need.
It'll be fine if you don't lie to yourself.
Should you go to the mail?
My veins are bleeding every time I use a tooth ending.
We got here fast because the move wasn't in progress.
You need to be careful.
What's wrong with you?
He's back soon from France.
Molly has a big clock.
Tom doesn't help me.
I haven't been in touch with him for a long time.
Those eyes are going.
What's missing?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until it's gone.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at the dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is an old senator.
Is French harder than English?
I don't care about that pair of shoes.
Are you scared of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall through the essenes.
You're not gonna do anything?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't stop the meeting.
Since when did Tom learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, it's a little bad.
I'm so embarrassed.
It looks like there's already over two thousand yogurt words in Tatoeba!
Tom's in a hurry.
We can't stop the collection.
I'm ashamed I did.
Let's get over here.
I know it's hard.
Are you the exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You were always a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
It's a gift to you.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind is not concerned about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't take it back yet.
Sorry to interrupt you.
The fact that he's too generous is his greatest lack.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane's always been acting like she's a very rich man.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
There's nothing left.
I don't have anything against the hot time.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new visits.
I'm hungry.
Flowers smell without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
Account, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Know what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
This isn't the problem.
Go meet him and leave this letter for a while.
This coke didn't end up a single egg.
I hear Tom stole the car.
We weren't hungry.
Dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom can't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school goes well.
Mrs. Young had nothing to say about visiting her unexpectedly.
You have a good mouth.
Many people will lose their jobs because of the collapse of the car industry.
He's coming to my aid.
We're going to start cutting down on Honolu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food is over.
The moment of glory for Hansin didn't last long, they were quickly replaced by the first place.
Is there a big house?
Isn't that going to lead to trouble?
He's proud he's called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail the test?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
Here we go at last!
I'm taller than you.
I think it's a lucky one.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel good, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pen on the kitchen window first to get out.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live that way anymore.
Ah, how sorry!
Hi, Jimmy.
Is it good for taste?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't force me to shoot you.
The Ecuadorian divides the Earth into two inches.
It was personal.
Don't you mind?
It's a great pleasure to see baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She had her hair cut out before the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna work today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them out?
Tom, how does he feel about the problem?
The thief got out of the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera's Tom's, isn't it?
I sent her a bullet.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me an hour.
Please, excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Watch this powder.
I'd better stay home.
It's not very fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
I'll see you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I've heard you've hurt them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I decided to go to France during the summer.
Please check the cards carefully.
Get off the bus for Badchrase and get off Zeestrase.
The smile is good for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the one Tom was told about.
Please add this site to the "Accessed".
When the culture's sun is low, Dori and the jewellery throws a big shadow.
When was the museum opened?
I've seen you somewhere.
He's sitting on his couch.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I'm not going to be on the threat.
You're in better shape than me.
Do you have a glass?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom's working for me.
He's awake late.
Tom's fine.
I'm walking like penguins.
Don't change the channel.
Watch where you're going.
Can I get your knife?
You have to file the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
Are you armed?
I wish he had told me earlier.
Don't look in the camera.
Wally, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me sorry about that.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water down, whatever it takes to keep a hole.
What's the name of this river?
Are you free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
They're covered with ice in the winter.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm already full.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want a portocal juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like French.
I think we need to make a deal.
I'm just buying soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket case?
I'm really busy.
I think you should come back.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I pulled a little bit while I was dancing, and I jumped on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into a pound.
I think Tom lied to us.
Tom's gonna make me laugh more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and die a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was headed the wrong way.
Tom has the right to know.
Your wind.
She took a test.
I'll study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom didn't give up.
Tom didn't bother.
I made a few mistakes in the test.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to get him out of here.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already seen a man.
Let's not lie.
I fixed it.
It's not an art.
I didn't see you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so excited.
Did you hear about him?
She ran out of the blouse right away.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open for visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you were wearing different hats?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had a single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, and Alice with him on Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna work.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
A letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better be sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He wrote to his mother from time to time.
The men enter the shape, driving the wheel.
It's not the end of history yet.
Don't be quick.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some sleep under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry bag.
Jim's name is James.
Do you have any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
There's a need for more research.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in France?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anna's a little girl.
Just push your fingers.
I went to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived in ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't have ammo.
You're my best friend.
I organized a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read some French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five inputs.
I just want to move with you.
She became twenty and one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They're coming from Sweden.
Watch out when you're crossing the busy street!
A man has to work.
That's exciting.
What's your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's in touch.
They're fighting for city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog used to be around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It's between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom murdered Mary.
I think Tom's moved too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat dry.
Throw those bitches out if you love them.
Please, be more careful in the future.
Tom was taken from the access to the panic.
Can I open a condom?
He was a baseballist.
Don't say anything like that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is completely occupied.
I'm proud of you for a ride.
I'll check the upstairs floor.
Tom's on his way to first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this if you love it?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you handle this?
I think you're getting so much.
You told me that one more time.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you that dress.
I work like a doll.
Brian made Kate wait.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't understand anything from French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate is eating a lot of fluid.
Don't get involved with this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be abolished.
God made a man first, then made a woman; then he humbled her, and gave her a drink.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't raise any noise.
Don't look at them.
I'll be back in an hour or something.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building is almost over.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Oh, he's dancing.
Today machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please, start now.
I've seen your driver's book.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from placebo.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human foolishness is endless," I say, and because of this self-criticalness, I think it's an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
The job's still high.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole show goes upstairs.
Isn't that embarrassing?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I want things to be as they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth removed last week.
The more you run, the more you smile.
Don't hide how you feel about that.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom often gets sick.
The key isn't in the key.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom re-insert the lamp.
It's my bike.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at an airport.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very mad.
Our teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have some fun together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out Tom's fault.
She put her pulser on.
Sometimes my money ends up.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with so many bad weddings, she's hardly even IMA teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a quiet little house.
Get back to bed.
Why don't you try your clothes before you buy it?
Tom killed himself, jumping out of a rock.
Where are you born?
These clothes are good for you.
They went straight to their destination.
The boy went through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
Account, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Have you finished dinner?
I heard Tom gave you your grandpa's cigarette.
Do what you think is right.
Don't you love Tom?
The state pays off.
They've arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being monitored by foreign intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it's been a mistake.
My dad's going to the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a prayer.
Don't push me.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another nonalcoholic?
A lot of people share my view on the matter.
The blues are clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big start at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed a train, didn't you?
The child is not a judge who should be filled, but a fire who should be burned.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Put the words on an alphabet line.
Tom can speak French a lot colder than I do.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I blew the girl in the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, but I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He finished Yale with honor in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
From milk we make cheese and butter.
How many episodes have you seen on One Piece?
I didn't mean it seriously.
I'm a vacation this week.
If a sick woman swallows thousands of paper jars, her desire will be healed.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see a walker.
Why did you leave?
I want my rice back.
I spent my vacation in Hacone.
Look at those documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They're drinking tea in the hall.
Tom set the engine on fire.
What the hell's going on?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Get 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that what's happening to you?
On the other hand, did you finally hear from him?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Watch out.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it out?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're the guys.
Bad time prevented us from leaving.
Now he's learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Stay there tonight.
You've come into the winning series.
I can't worry about that.
The distribution of television has been a significant waste of our time reading.
I'm gonna need a whole lifetime to explain everything.
Don't put me in a cell.
The new corona virus is very infected.
Every time I look for you, you don't.
You're coming down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm not officially here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't come by 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a broken branch.
I need to fix this.
I'm ready for breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife is dumb.
She looked at me in a multi-significant manner.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to sleep early.
I love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people are able to speak well, others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see me.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Close your teachers.
I heard someone came in.
Tom went his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan has a lot of different shapes.
Do you believe there is a God?
I'm hanging out with the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses were burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it on your own.
She was sentenced to death.
I've been waiting for five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house is burning.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How heavy is your daughter?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borch" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees were lowered.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over forty years old.
Are you wearing the driver's book?
I don't need your help.
He's in front of the door.
My business is getting worse again.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I can't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid now we can't talk about raising.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you scared?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn the light on?
He's drinking half a lot of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You've broken the screws in the back.
We just got information from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's the matter, actually?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.

Drink water.
Don't worry.
Tom's not good lately.

One coffee, please.

Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China we lay before the family first and after the name.
Give it to him.

Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.

Now the service is yours.
I'll leave tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.

I haven't said yes yet.
I barely got along with the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But there's a baby, a Turkish pancake, go to Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.

I need to know.
When does it end?
It's turning on me every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it till 2:30.

God knows what can happen in an hour!
I slept while I read a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't so strong.
I'm not a king.
They've gone through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilograms of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to your house?

I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?

I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm so happy.
You don't have to say such things when there's kids around.
He's making it easy.
I want to improve my French production.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today's the train's delayed by ten minutes.
It's been quiet.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You're learning French, aren't you?
I have to go to a meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing on the weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The check is not open.
Try to calm down.
We need to do an inquiry on the date of the test.
Maybe he's running away from us.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.

You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go and say hello to Tom.
I think Tom May is drunk.
I've had a lot of headaches.
Why don't you sleep?

There's a little chance I can't get to the meeting.

Give me your rice.
I don't take any medications.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to fill his audience.
He'll arrive at Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They're eating apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I'm recently very excited. My favorite football team is the West.
It was easy for me to contact him with the nice stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I've been learning French for three years with a language carrier.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until it's light.
Tom's hurt.
His room is his fault.
They divide part of their free time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
I really don't think Tom's planning on leaving.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
I'll stay for three more days.
We stopped leaving in the morning.
Nature doesn't know borders.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with different things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John were here, he wouldn't have asked me to come.
You'd better dress a powder under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laugh.
I completely removed it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Please add this site to the Pre-Accessed.
I've got a lot to say on this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what concerns you.
The worst thing is it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were futile and the man was soon to die.
I noticed you weren't there last night.
We're in danger.
You want to buy this half.
He's a great brain surgeon.
Last month, I got out.
He can also speak French.
Are you leaving?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They took the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been living in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He's just eating fruit.
It wasn't so funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You're learning French, aren't you?
The girl used to play only.
Play in a group.
Birds sing.
Tom's done the job at 5:00.
Even though Tom left home early today, he's late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
That's how you feel.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to discover it.

Watch out for him.
Be accurate.

Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss .
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
Shoot me.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
I've been pretty, haven't I?
You really speak French quite well.
Hi, Jimmy.
I heard what he said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's happening.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get the basic knowledge of the number.
I finished my philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always share in the work of the younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't stop a man from believing in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very good.
The climate doesn't work.
You're sitting in my seat.
Don't you have anything to fear?
They all agree with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want a MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm worried about thinking about it.
I paid two bucks.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I don't have any intention of interrupting that clock for a little while, and I'm not talking about breaking up with him at all.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna be fine.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we've got enough food.
I'll be in the next bus.
Mary made sandwiches with eggs.
What did you see?
I bought it every morning in the summer.
Cut your rice.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure at your place.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time for his word.
I prefer grapefruits in front of the portals.
This place deserves to be visited at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister laughed at her blouse.
I told you another time, didn't I?
Why do you keep repeating that there's too much time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want any gold or silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like a Portuguese juice.
Ever since I took your book, until I left it, I've always lived by my smile, and one day I think I'd start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fight's on the run.
And that's what I saw.
The dolphin is a bat.
What color are these?
He searched his son's frame.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nine flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace can't be maintained with honor, he'll stop being peace.
She made the room with beautiful furniture.
Jacob’s calculators can buy at the price of a pair of hats, and they need thousands of British children in school, not less than a mollusc and a rubber.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered her eyes.
This is my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop sneezing.
You can't just go and blame people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not safe.
I'm taking the money back.
She's ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a chicken without his head.
Greece is an old side.
Several people visited the meeting.
He dressed his coat and left the house.
Tatoeba's new website will use the home "hiper" database, "founded by the foundations" search, and will go to the tattoo-OS server with tattoo CPU, made entirely of tattoo.
The old man stopped her.
She hated calling her a coward.
I like it very much.
I've never voted.
Where's the toilet?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I don't intend to apologize to Tom.
What are you doing?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What are you going to recommend?
I'm sure Tom hasn't even noticed you're late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be quick to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, and Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Look where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom didn't get used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you put too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
Without a hat?
I've seen these photos.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What's the minimum payment in Luxembourg?
His judgment is predetermined.
Are these holy?
If you have to choose between a beer and a cigarette, what would you choose?
The answer is yes.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't leave the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there in a week.
That's good.
This kind of thing is scary.
I think it's better to sleep.
I love you very much.
I called the phone.
The wolves are moving on the guinea pigs.
Do you have medical insurance?
Look out, Tom!
The museum's closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't give up.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
That guy's stable.
I haven't won yet.
That wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what's going to happen.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're heading this wrong.
Something's happening.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for all the others.
Are you sure you want to throw it off?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved our sense of what was.
I played you.
His shirt was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book are dealing with some of the many problems young people have faced.
I've been waiting a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more detail?
Is it wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we should study things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That door is really good for you.
I think you'll be a great father.
There's no way you can connect to him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in at nine?
Let's synchronize the clocks.
I'm selling every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do it.
Is this a safe shop?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I told you, it's good.
This is the camera Tom made with the photos.
Make sure you don't lose.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man far away.
We worked well to connect the two ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she's not going to freeze, no matter who she says.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The respondent was given the right to appeal.
Let's not hurry.
My father went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make quick exits.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
The wine is the milk of the adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he gets into his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I dream of nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found that Mary was missing.
I've seen these photos.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we get a cab?
I hope I'm not late.
I came home with the train.
Why are you always so bad?
Come on!
That's why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I closed the boy's sleep deep.
She called it what she didn't.
Are we able to do this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should've opened my suitcase.
We've discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The floods were hit by the cold.
He's fired for dogs.
The kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to give up my invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be so stupid.
They hated Tom.
