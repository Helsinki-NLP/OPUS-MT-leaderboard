Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiovan of refusing direct political discussions with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists on Monday.
At this point, Kiovan's leadership does not want to carry out an ongoing political debate with its former country, Putin said the news agency Itar-Tass said.
He also said that the Russian-American separatists, whom Kiova and the West say are the assistants of the Russian army, tried to work for the Ukrainian troops longer than their current location, where Putin said that the Ukrainian army was killing civilians.
The aim of the militarists is to remove these armed groups and their society so that they will not be able to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was organized in the morning and in the evening with Ryrmikorjam.

In Finland, there is a strong law that restricts the acquisition of explosives for the manufacture of substances.
In the case of private individuals, the Police Administration must continue to request permission to buy or hold any substances or substances that could be used as such as explosives as a source.
These substances include vetyroxide, nitrometane, typeic acid, potassium chloride, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate, as well as its derivatives if the determination values exceed.
Vepyrocids, for example, are in cleaning and washing agents, but they usually do not exceed limit values.
Nitrometane, for example, is used in an acceleration period.
However, before the entry into force of the law, acquired materials may be stored and used until 2 March 2016.

With Valioli: Super Raheem Cast - Mario remained hidden - With Valioli - Night-Sanomat
A 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered to be the future of an English football.
White Hart Lane had a solar eclipse when Mario Ballotelli, confirmed by Liverpool, arrived at Tottenham.
Super Marion's initialization was promising: experienced English artists saw work in the Italian field at the age of 24 in a very different manner than in Manchester City.
Ballotelli was still far away from his superiors.
Italian destroyed three of the natural landscapes and ate only half of his food for his team.
The Polish supporters who have already taken the lead in the game are waiting for a better turn.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers sat in the role of the team on the Balotell Barcelone tour of Luis Suarezin as the second enemy to Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotell, the group was rocked by the middle of the diamond corner of Raheem Sterling, which broke a 3-0-inch important opening ground of the end of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just working.
Ballotellia 20 cents shorter English is between the opposite lines than in the water.
The feature is not common to the player, who boasts at best about 30 miles [34 km] per hour.
Rodgers also deserves great appreciation for Sterling's development.
The Northern Irelandese reported after the adoption of Liverpool's systematic development on Wembley's growing-up of a mere player of the most popular player in the world.
Susanna Mälkki was elected mayor of Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and successful"

I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm," he says.
Management of employers' organisations in the housing sector - Home - Areas - News - Karjalanen
Retirement negotiations will be called for today's new speed on the meetings of the labour market organisations themselves.
The governments of SAK, Akavan and STTK’s organisations will discuss the negotiating report in the morning.
Following this, it is intended to continue bilateral retirement negotiations.
The labour market organisations have, inter alia, committed themselves to the life-producing process.
The companies have promised the employment solution to the sex scene, but according to the latest estimates, it would be born this week.
It's a little girl.
The Rovaniemeleen women's airport crew Women Volley competed with the passengers for the Vampua Urhelians in the final summer of the training market.
Vampula was a winner of 3-2 in a vein.
The last time WoVo disappeared 15-11.
The neighbor was in front of him all the time.
The fight was good, but in defense games and passports Vampula was a little better, saw WVon manufacturer Teemu Mäkikyrö.
The six-year-old WoVon was a Russian that 190-cent American center Jennifer Keddy was on the bright side.
The center played Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her gambling experience, was the most powerful association between Johanna Pekkaris and WoVon.
As an applicant, Jenna Central was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 times.
The best part of the Vampoo was the famous Russian passport and the free Hillaelina Hajelänänen, which is the most possible route of the VoVo.
The preparation of WoVon goes on for the first week when Hämeenlinn's HPK comes to Rovanjem.
They meet in the group on Saturday at 18 o'clock in the official exercise games.
On Sundays, we will be assigned to refurbishing the stadium.
Lidl's due diligence in Finland
The business exchange between Finland and Finland grew by close to 25 per cent during the financial year ended in February to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company published its results on Monday.
Lidlil now has 142 sales in Finland, and the extension will continue.
Ledl also said that it paid to Finland almost EUR 14 million from the last invoices.
Lidl Suomi belongs to the German Lidl Group.
There are more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
In the case of post-diagnosed and threatened treatment in the areas of most frequently established rural areas, the death of a manoeuvre is often due to the arrival of a diagnosis and treatment.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video to show mothers who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women who live in rural areas have a higher risk of dying from ovarianism than in urban areas.
Researchers went through more than 1100 Australians in 2005 with female patients receiving ovarian diagnosis and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after diagnosis, were diagnosed.
According to researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, women who live in isolated and remote areas are more likely to die of 20% than women who live in urban areas during the study.
OUTER CARTON: New medicines may slow down skin and ovarian cancer
The researchers went through the seven years of women’s health history.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, also during the diagnosis of a woman’s age, a type of ovarian cancer, prior diseases and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
The likelihood of survival during diagnosis was low in older women and in the diet.
Women living in remote and remote areas died 20 per cent more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to find out why women living outside the city have less chance to cope with ovarian cancer, but Jordan has a possible reason for delayed diagnosis and delayed access to treatment.
"Gynecologists will best care for this disease, and their response will be found in most large cities," Jordan says.
Although the treatment carried out by the emergency service is generally low and the importance of distance is low, researchers also suggest that more mobility of doctors may be improved so that special physicians can treat patients closer to these homes and programs that support all away-treated patients.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is bad despite the economic situation, which stresses the need for better treatment and better food prevention programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old Elisha Neavla, who lived in Gold Coast, was found to be a bad ovarian.
The city of Rovanieme wants to strengthen the location of a Christmas park in the Friendly Village, located next to the hotel in Nordjanhov.
On Monday, the City Management Board decided that the proposal for a replacement of the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on the Environment would be set up for public service in Oswiitt.
The proposal for a plan asks for opinions from the environmental society and the Life Centre of Lap.
With the help of the change in accommodation, the city wants to allow travel-related motorcycling to continue in the area.
It is intended to form a field that should be included in the current Area of Friendship and the area between it and those between them.
On 15 November to 30 April, the place shall be kept up to 200 motor vehicles.
The area may also be subject to the specified part of the tanking points.
The new rural area will be allowed to travel in such a way as to age.
The city of Rovanieme has been rented from the area of the friendship park for the Safari companies during the summer of the motorcycling.
The lease agreement has been renewed for the last few months of 2014 and the agreement is in force for the summer of 2018.
The steel park operation and the change in design have raised a serious challenge.
The residents of neighboring camps have been close to the sound of both their own and their own emissions.
However, the emissions of the area have been examined and no findings have been identified in the findings.
The revised scale is even older than the previous one.
The friendly parking area also supports that if the starting point was to be moved longer, the hotel's safari owners should travel to the starting points of the Safari bus, which would be estimated from 15 days away.
The area and the surrounding environment, according to the city, also has a sufficient size for the villages, better than the places presented as starting points, such as the eastern side of Ounasjo's walls.
The area of friendship is also a good reason for actions to be extended in the future, for example, to the Ounaspavjon region.
The consolidation of the parking operation is part of the approval by the Rovanie City Authority of the city strategy, which aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for business, by providing a sufficient range of regions with a logical and operational advantage.
The friendship pool has also been designated as the starting point of the motorcycling to the central part of the project, which has not yet received legal power.
The number of properties can be seen in tree branches
The decline in the number of resident owners, particularly in the 35-year-old group, may lead to a reduction in the trade of timber products by ten million, when young consumers reach the age of the "head group of timber". Financial Times told the Iso-British Forest Trades Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Time Report, housing contractors use only 55 per cent of the amount of the housing allowance.
The study also revealed that more and more are living in very urbanly populated dwellings where there are no trees. In addition, the entire tree is smaller when the tree is increasingly located in the park. These factors also threaten the forest area, which has an estimated value of about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the large area of London, the property has been reduced by 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years and is used for the household products at the lowest cost in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Forestry Association (RHS), the increase in renting of apartments or the decline of trees does not mean that people cannot grow crops.
Guy Barter, RHS's leader of forestry councils, says that "for example, growth in transferable plants is particularly recommended in the centre of housing, as such growth rates can be taken into account when necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the result of the redundancy of the resale sales in the field, as the ownership and availability of apartments increased from the end of the 80th century to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will rise due to better stocks this year, in the last year’s summer and April.
Turkey belongs to the United States of America because of the labour force report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced diplomat in the United States to provide a report on the American and British occupation in Turkey.
According to Minister of Finance, the United States Ambassadors and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the Web site The Intercept have written that the United States National Security Agency (NSA)'s previous analysis documents by Edward Snowden reveal Turkey as the main focus of the United States and the United Kingdom Information Services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report saying that all major countries are blind to each other.
Previously, the German intelligence service reported a more aggressive reaction in the Turkish government during the incident in Ankara.
Cannes Leader Croze is present in the new Finnish photo
Many successful Canadian artists, Marie-Josée Croze, have been attracted to the woman’s head in the new Finnish photo.
Croze shows the director Mikko Kuparis in the film 2 night of the morning, which shows the pictures start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the highest women's prize in Cannes' film in the year 2003.
He has also appeared in Steven Spielberg's movie Munich and Julian Schnabel's film at the pool of the family.
Two nights in the morning photo's room is Mikko Newisianen.
The film will be released in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magalupin Police Officer, accused of corruption
The manifests of the incident provided evidence of the abuse of police and city officials in the Malorcan Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Calvian police officer in Mallorcan's summer camp has been detained as a result of corruption in the area of Magalufin known for its campaign.
Colonel José Antonio Navarro was appointed to investigate after several of the owners of the Punta Ballena Street presented corruption practices against him. The Punta Ballena street is located most of the Magalup's bars and night-stars.
According to the newspaper Mallorca Diario published on the network, the manifest of the case gave evidence of the criminal offence committed by police and city officials in the city of Calvian during the day in the office of the prosecutor against the corruption of Mallorcan.
The Spanish National Card was held by two other local police officers in connection with corruption, and they are a member of the judge together with Navarro.
ABC’s website, published throughout the country, wrote about the jealousy of the authorities who hated night owners, who were significantly concerned about their business activities.
"There is no money in this, but survival," said one of the contractors to the Court of Justice.
You don't destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in many countries in search of newspapers this summer when a YouTube video was broadcast on the Internet, where 18-year-old British novelist broke his lips with 24 men during the Pub Crawlin.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to stop the use of Magalup’s novelty and uncontrolled use by reducing the number of participants in the poor, alcoholic pubcrowli.
In addition, the Playhouse auction, where the video was described, was scheduled to be closed for a year, and the owner of the evening and the pub-crawl organizer were assigned to Carnage to pay a total of EUR 55,000.
First of all, among young British tourists, the recommended tourist destination of Magalufin has also been recommended, e.g. a balconing train, which has caused many problems with alcohol use when people have gone to the other or to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Children of Israel Return to school after the Gaza Strip
The Israelite children of Israel returned to the Gaza Strip on the day they were expelled from school during the summer bombings, when the raids and the raids destroyed their communities for 50 days in the war of Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed in the war zone.
The opening of schools caused joy and enthusiasm in the bombings of rockets in the communities of southern Israel, but the follow-up to the wars is still visible.
In the town of Ashdod, in the east of the city of Pashosh, workers removed the trails from the walls and stairs before the arrival of children from the day-to-day examination of the rocket.
"We are a little afraid but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in Saad-saad, in the Israeli municipality, and works as an English teacher in the city school.
A lot of children living in this area are desperately in need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, says that after a long time of school, she feels "a little strange."
"We've had difficult times between us, where we didn't all go anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Gaza border with support.
By the beginning of the last week, thousands of residents of the Saad border areas had remained in the interiors or had left their homes for safer areas far from Gaza from the source of prairie rockets and cranes.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Ozi community in the vicinity of Gaza are suspicious of the return of a 4-year-old son of the Palestinian Kranaat in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, ten families had not returned.
The children of these families are placed in a second alternative school.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, near Gaza bordering the city of Gaza, where there was a heavy Palestinian siege.
She encouraged the children to study carefully and promised to "care for children's education and safety".
Israel and Hamas agree on a second coming in force in the last decade.
The conflict was interrupted immediately, but it did not bring a solution to many of the issues of openness, such as the need for the removal of the Israeli and Egyptian islands and the reopening of the Gazan air and seas.
Israel wants to fight against the weapons of Hamash and return to the dead body of Israel’s army.
Egypt is expected to start a new irregular negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel had different opinions about the number of the dead, and at least half of the dead were soldiers, although they had no reliable evidence to support this.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other Gazans shot 4,591 rockets and grenades to the Israelite cities in the south in battle.
On behalf of Israel’s army, over 5,000 air raids and other attacks were carried out.
Israel’s residents have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and from an estimate of 250 000 people have been protected from attending a school of over 100 United Nations, which has been transformed into temporary shelters.
As thousands of people are still in the race and as the fighting continues, the school authorities moved to school last week.
"I hope that school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, in the city of Gaza.
In general, the prices of the apartments have increased by more than seven years as a summer month in Australia.
The price of the apartments in the capital city of Australia, measured by RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, rose by 1.1% in August, revealed RP's information as a country.
As a result of rising prices in summer, summer, and summer, the total price rose by 4.2 per cent, more than the same month after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not increased equally around the country.
According to RP Data researcher Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne, prices are rising at high prices.
The results of the RP Data show that the prices of the apartments in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent and Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the most popular; the average price increase is between five and six percent.
The lowest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4% per cent per year as a result of the government's past events.
According to Lawless, Australia's beginnings will increase the number of apartments in the sale during the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in sales of rental-trading apartments, generally cheap sales and continued low levels, it is likely that the price increases of apartments will continue for the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta museum has taken the preliminary conclusions of Mönttä
The new museum and pictures have taken the forecast public this summer in Méntat.
By the end of August, Serlachiuk had visited over 70,000 visitors.
The new Gösta museum was opened in June and there have been other classics of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
I was also told of a travel trip that took place yesterday when 14,500 interested guests were present during the moment.
These articles have not been verified.
The child has fallen from the door and windows," says director Paul Sivonen Serlachius.
Sivonen estimates that the year-long visit to the Serlachius Museums will take place this year to close to hundreds of thousands.
In the past few years, there have been some 40,000.
There are about 11,000 inhabitants of the Mäntta Vilppapala, located in the south of Tampere and Jyväskyl.
The director of the museum, Sivonen, recalls that the new museums are always open.
"The challenge is to make the revelation permanent," he says.
There, too, we hope that the art will continue for a long time.
New samples will be opened in the safest place.
The police were investigating the last four days of the siege in Kajana.

The event was a lot of rare temperatures.
According to the air station, the average temperature of the summer will be restored once a decade.
The statistics of the air station show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than normal.
In most of the country, the exception was one of the two stages.
Because of the heat of summer and summer, the sun became more warmer than usual.
The highest temperature was measured in the first week of August in Portugal, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never loved me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in 1958 in the British Midlands region of Dudley, Germany.
Henry's father worked at work and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry exercises his best for Rudy's Rare Records -- comedy show, which is partly based on his father's mental discussion and which has been developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The voices are mixed with the reggat and the rap on the upbeat.
Henry's got to go through some kind of childhood nightmares.
She has often been treated after her mother's death, and she has much to do with her father.
Dad was very hard to read.
His growth has never been seen, but my voice said, "Stop the metal."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were already grown children when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of the butterfly or the beauty of the cricket.
I've never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life he was the funny man in the corner, reading his words.
Henry recently opened a metallic hole in Dudley and was able to discuss what his father's life had to be, even though working conditions are now better than they were then.
These are now slightly lighter, but they are actually dark, dry, labyrinth deeps where the leaves, sand and rock are drawn to the mind.
The father had a way to go to bed, and only the land on his feet, and suddenly he began to sing his own song to himself in his poem.
As I walked around the house, I realized that he had done that work for years to get us food to eat, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite Henry’s childhood, his parents lacked the closeness to offer.
My father never liked me and never said he loved me.
As soon as my mother became ill shortly before she died, we began to share our love for each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter with Dawn French, and through her child, he has been able to share the love he has missed for himself as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Stop it! Stop it!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's still a good friend with Frank, whom he had been married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good man.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
He's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one cause that led to Mother's death.
When I began to suffer from rupture and diabetes, my doctor ordered me to make a complete rule.
After that, I started a lot of drugs, and I also had to start breast-feeding to reduce my symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And stupid.
No one's been enjoying eating the pigeons.
Henry's familiar, the short part of the kentes depicts his transformation during the construction process.
Having received much good criticism from Othello as a role model, he has dedicated himself to the production of the theatre.
The following year, the Comedys came and August Wilson Fences ("Aids").
Theater's making offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedians that Henry's made throughout his summer.
Henry started working in the field when he was 16 years old.
One of our aunts noticed him on the stage with his imitations and contacted New Faces in the field of skills competition.
Henry's TV set began in the middle of the 70th century. "How long have I been the only black actor and comet?" he says.
Henry learned his job.
I had to grow up as an adult in the summer of the public, and I had to learn to make jokes about moving in 1975 and 1985, while I was on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the rights to show The Black and White Mintrel Show, a nice winter program where people appeared as black-headed, so Henry decided to come to the comedy program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been involved in it, but I don't miss it.
Although my position was strange and unpleasant, I was able to do work on major events and learn how to deal with the public.
Nevertheless, the "britti-TV awarded, multi-year favor and soft winter programme" was the same as "serious parishion of black people".
Henry worked for 80 years in a second range of comedians, where he was made to play and admire British culture.
The first section of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and by the 90th century Henry was known for his arrest as Garreth Blacklock in Chef!
The next decade, Henry published a series of advertisements, documents, TV series and movies, but in BBC in 2008, after his LennyHerry.TV series, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now seems to be that you're only in your place or you're driving on the pages?"
The next day, Radio 4 had a documentary "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't very well taught at school, and I think it belongs to a white middle class that uses sugarcane and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's life got scared of me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – told me, "Examine.
Don't ignore the whole idea before you know what you're talking about.
You'll get your words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry wrote 20 copies of Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I knew I could do this.
It felt as if some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"That's the point, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your secret, do a little research.
So the training process was complicated, and I read the sample months before it was implemented.
The show was finally a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it did not.
Shortly after that, Henry showed up his head on the Erehdys comedys.
Suddenly I showed up in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At some point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
On one occasion, there were technical problems, and Henry clearly knew that his task was to speed up the public.
"My little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to spend 10 minutes alone until your computer works again.'
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would be continued as soon as the problem was corrected.
I walked out of sight, and part of me would take care of relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it in the hands of others.
"You're part of the show, stay in your role"
Henry in the "Fences" exhibition in the Duchess theater
It was challenging to learn the lessons from the "Fences" exhibition.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more patient.
This too was taken very seriously, so it was as a sign of God; "This is what you have to do."
Of course, Henry says this by the voice of KUMEALLA.
Then I decided to stay here.
I love this job with all my heart.
I love gyms.
Henry, however, remains the key element: the small son of a bitch keeps our discussion going on as he exchanges imitation.
Maintaining the standing-up communiqué is a matter of concern, as receiving immediate thanks from the public without being aware of the danger.
If you keep pushing it, it can lead to your nightmares.
I'll spend a lot of time on Apollo theaters when it feels like it, but generally, it doesn't make me the same person as before.
I'm asking Henry if he's gonna go to the new stand-up.
It brings me real joy to sit together with a guide who helps me shape the whole journey's bottom, middle and end, and I don't think I'd ever want to feel that way.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like to show you...
It's really fun.
The exhibition continues to tell the story, and it's a waste of time.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya produces registers for officials to remove "famous workers"
Kenya has begun to create biometric registers by attempting to remove "mouse workers" from the government's payrolls.
Employees who had not notified the register for the next two weeks would no longer be paid, as reported in the government report.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid for their official leave.
President Uhuru Kenyata agreed to cut the corruption of the public sector after its official act in 2013.
According to a review carried out earlier this year, the wages of "smokers" and other economic abuses amounted to at least a million dollars a month.
The government suspects that the wages will be paid to the people after the person has died or left his official office, the BBC Wadaw Chebusir reported on the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the registry within the following weeks in order to ensure that their data is recorded in biometric registration mode, the government’s communication was informed.
According to the report, all those who leave this absence for any reason shall be removed from the payroll.
"There is a significant reason for the public sector in that way, because it determines how many souls really act in their tasks, and it also clears payrolls at both levels of government, thus solving "the problem of workers", says Anne Waiguru, the official of the Ministry of Education and Planning.
The result of the 2015 wall survey may be EUR 25.5 million if the city adjusts its activities and develops its economic situation in the near future.
On the basis of the current budgetary framework, there are some 9.4 million deficits.
As a possible means of improving the scope and scale of services, as well as the purchases of services, the sale of property and the aid, and the increase in tax and tax revenues.
EUR 10 million of the investment in cash is 8.5 million.
There is no relief in the public's situation.
The new obligations imposed on them, the growth of insufficient tax revenues, increasing unemployment and the decrease of five per cent of state shares will gradually weaken their vision.
The aim of the financial seminar is to find new means to balance the economy.
The city administration is united in the fact that savings must be made in time.
The ship must be converted to the objective of the strategy by President Kimmo Heinonen of the City Management Board.
The city administration returned the presentations made for further preparation of the steering group.
The city management proposals are based on the budget statement at the Economic Seminar of the Authority in Frame on 8 September.
After the discharge of the mandate, the budget proposal will advance through the management of the services of the public administration and the administration of the city.
Ten Turkish police were detained as suspects of the "union" regime
All 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey as suspects of "the anti-government unit", whereas local media sources are scattered.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to the Journal of the Daily News, Hurriyet had 14 high-value police officers in the group.
Some of the police were involved in corruption investigations last December involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In August, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for organizing a large crime unit and for following up on the telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister at the time) said that he and others had been planning to take part in the police action, including Islamic President Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of Ukraine's schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1st).
This is traditionally important for families, and in the same way as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiters that not all schools have opened up again, but he said he was committed to defending the earth for future generations:
On the first day of September, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the entire vast Ukrainian elite must fight for peace.
Alexa Pastukhov, who serves as a leading teacher at the Slavian school where Yatseyuk's daughter is attending, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will be restored in the future and that children will be able to learn from the lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is usually a child’s book about places, air conditioning, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Texasin Perry, the emperor's oath was a promise.
On Twitter, confirmed by Governor Rick Perry of Texas, a photo of the radicalist of democracy was sent by the border guard on Sunday morning on charges of abuse of power at this hearing.
The Twitter was later removed, and it was followed by a new tweet, where Perry complained that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was probably sent to my cell phone.
"I won't accept a tweet and I've removed it," said the press later.
Perry's team did not respond immediately to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent to Perry's confirmed Twitter, it's unclear who would publish the picture.
The first tweeted on the contents of the revulsion film by the border officer Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to a licence in April 2013.
Perry refused the funding of the Lehmberg Office, which led to a large meeting of military personnel in Austin this month. Perry is a potential candidate for presidential elections in 2016.
"I'm not always in the heat, three times allowed by the greater promulgation... but when that happens, I'm accusing Governor Perry of showing me."
I'm a democracy of the people of Texas.
The man's office did not lead to a large team investigation against Perry.
The study was conducted by Michael McCrum, a specialist in San Antiionos, who was appointed by the Republican Chamber.
Perry has said she was guilty and called charges as a political one.
His influential lawyer has asked the court to dismiss the charges and said that the law on the basis of which the longest official in Texas is charged is wrong against the constitutional law.
Perry cut off $7.5 million from State support for the State's public integrity to the unit responsible for operating in Travis's border and handling public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to separate.
Perry's decision to leave the follow-up group to issue a formal complaint.
Perry's Twitter route is regularly updated – and, on the other hand, correctly.
To be released to the fifth place at the Ivan election in 2012 during his presidential campaign, Perry threatened to finish his post on Twitter by publishing a picture on his own on the "Come to South Carolina!" series.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again "normal"
One of London’s most important operators has warned that the Kaakkois-English housing market has "sold" to a normal level of activity.
The capital city of London has been affected by a serious demand and a high price at the same time as a wide spread of credit cards, which was allowed by the Bank of England to set limits on the housing costs in June.
On Monday, President Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the High Representative of Berkeley, said that "markets and trades have returned normally since the beginning of the financial year" and added that this has allowed "a stable functioning environment".
In the London residential market, in a very good time, foreign investors went to the capital city.
According to Marekister, the city’s population prices rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year only and thus exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average prices for the private, judge and student buildings in Berkeley rose in about five years, reaching 423,000 points by the end of April.
However, the confirmed point has made London's buildings less attractive in the last month - part of the opinion has also affected the new construction fees and the political rhetoric of possible "card tax" prior to May's general elections.
In the past week, the Lomé Building Provider Foxtons warned that the April housing report, which mentioned the strictest loan rules, would lead to a lower market growth rate, as well as lower sales rates of buildings and prices in the second half of the year.
The small data from the English bank showed that the number of approved wages fell in July, which refers to late housing markets.
Hamptons International has calculated the prices of London’s buildings in 2015 and the prices will be calculated by three per cent, as the prices of the housing economy have already begun to fall.
The number of trades in London in the most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has gone back in the fourteenth year, according to WA Ellis.
However, in the capital city, there is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased the income from the sales of the buildings to over 2.2 billion points.
Pigley added that "good planning, the demand for the right product in the best places has remained stable and that is why the sale has been slow".
In June, the company reported its sales of 3,742 new homes in April last year, which is nearly three times more than in 2007 than in the preceding financial crisis.
In the years leading to tax losses, the figure rose by 40 per cent over the year by about 380 million pounds and the turnover grew by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Pidgin said that the reasons for the year of Berkeley were in line with the current market expectations.
The analysis is of the same opinion as that of 450 million pounds per year for the preceding tax year.
The spare part of the Berkeley marketed in London in the morning at a price of 23,96 pounds.
Hacker by Jennifer Lawrence Alastonkuvia
Jennifer Lawrence arrived at the 85th Academy Awards.
The hacker, who claims to be holding hundreds of other images of the year Oscar's exhibitor Jennifer Lawrence was online.
The representative of the hunger strike confirmed that the pictures are real and judged by the hacker's "absolute personality theft".
The authorities have been contacted, and all who publish the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The pictures published by the 4chan photo website were apparently wrong because of the weakness of the Applen iCloud system. A hundred other hackers on the list are claimed to be ten other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
I don't know how much of the pictures are true, actually Scott Pilgrim against the World, the Winstead decided on hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at me and my husband in private years then take pictures: hopefully you have a good idea," Winsted said.
However, Victoria Justice rejected the reality of the images and claimed that "these so-called substations are NOT new to me, do you not understand".
Let me do this end immediately at the beginning.
BuzzFedin later Sunday announced that Pope Ariana Granden rejected the reality of images of stars.
Only we can express our gratitude to Howard Jacobson for the new novel that tells us about love and j-books.
They walked, it pictured the best thing that happened, and gradually they went out from one other than the rest of the sand to the other.
Only then did he hear from his wife that he was too serious, severe, intense, frustrated, and perhaps a little longer.
That's when he lifted his hand.
He knew where he was.
Yes, he was as tall as this one.
His last sacrifice was at the beginning, however, a relationship that had been promising; it had shown that this relationship could have made it easy for him to isolate himself, and it might have brought his life even some content.
The ark of Solomon had unmatched hair, and he was a mighty spiritual beauty in a joyful heart, of the northern wall, which was even more tender and taller than the Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with his older traveling companion, who Kevern was his aunt. He had been given a room that was located in a garden but on a paradise floor, and his name was also suitable for Paradise.
No one lived in the house for years.
The holes grew, in all the bathrooms there were nocturnals, and after having left the windows all over their own place, there grew up in a wooden garden with weeds that reminded the rest of the cadavers.
The tree was like a seed of children, at the same time dangerous and dangerous, a tree full of secrets.
Written by Howard Jacobson, who is in Rome "J" under the terms of the Booker Literature Agreement in 2014.
Proposals will be published in the first week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailen in the midst of the terrible terasis in the middle of them, enjoying the warmest evenings of the day, both of them eagerly listening to the music and comforting news through the whole earth, when Ailein's Christian bodies, the hardened feet of the sun brought to his mind a song that had long since been forgotten by his father’s black performances and that had often been heard by his father’s spares under.
Your leg is too big.
Initially, such songs were too aggressive, and they were no longer called in response.
They had not been banned — nothing had been formally banned — they were no longer called.
They wanted to leave the dream as they said.
The general opinion was reached at the time of what had not been achieved by laws and advertising: just as in the writing sector, people chose to read sacred monuments, magical books, and novels, they also recommended dances for music.
As the day bursts, Kevern began playing a visual piano and sings serenadia on the big feet of Ailen with a loud voice.
I don't understand.
"It was the jazzman Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and came in the same nature as two syllables in front of him.
So his father had always done before the "j" letter had never been painted on his lips.
It was starting to play between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father told him that he was playing the same game with his father.
If you were to save your mouth with a word starting with, and you didn't remember to raise two tears in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay a penny.
It wasn't very fun at that time, and it wasn't it right now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what Jazz is.
I've never heard of that before.
Jazziaka was not officially declared a ban, it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in the form.
There was only one case in life.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
That's the same way it's been done.
Its improbableness has made people nervous.
And jazz was also a music show of precision.
Although Kevern was not ten years old to hear Sammy Davis Junior, jazz music had come to him through his father's semi-circuit CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't need to tell the Air Force that Fats Waller was black.
In view of Aileen’s age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the recommended singers were not black.
There is no need for laws or enforcement.
The audience meant that each part of it was accepted as grateful — thanks to the fact that they were as good as saved by the trade — by the principle that each group did things for it.
On the basis of their temperature and physical characteristics, the African-Caribalian kisses of their own people are suitable for the best entertainment and entertainment, so they sing and dance.
The original natives of India were like nature gifted with electronic devices, so their task was to ensure that each family had an active phone used to handle matters.
Those who remained from the Polish community were working as prostitutes; the last Greeks broke orders.
When the SE, WHAT THE SECURITY, JOS TAPAHTUI came to the truth, they were from Persia and the Middle East, whose ancestors had not courageously put them in the fear that they would be blamed for the swarming of flies and fear that they would be the next to them, opened the restaurants that offered labyrinth yogurts and burned the riverbed, and continued their lives as a waste of land.
Every one of them, according to their gifts.
The tool had only been heard by ballers, and it was hard for him to understand how the words just sung by Kevin were never able to sing like music.
I've also expressed love through others.
"They're not really cute," Kevern said.
Except for the big ones.
My father never shot anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned tree created an illusion of security.
None of the words would go through the voting of the left-hand handcuffs.
I don't know. I don't understand.
Why did your dad love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole case was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two dogs in the background of Aileen.
The ship was gonna take him out now.
"It was Dad's idea to be fun," he said instead.
The gun suddenly ends up in confusion, and his hair is hidden from Kevin's face.
There's nothing more visible in the whole world than Aileen's big, haircut.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you ever say so," he said, "you didn't sound sure.
But it doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
The world seemed really surprised.
Is that how my legs are?
He looked at it again.
Your legs aren't probably big.
Your nose, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my neck is too tight?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it's been too long for him.
"You're going to have to get rid of me because of your fats," he tried to fix the situation.
I've been thinking about it.
It didn't help.
He wanted to hear it from the funeral.
Often when he wanted to commit suicide, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the assured charm that can control the greed of the visas.
Maybe his father meant to be cool.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted the same.
No matter how smooth their eyes are.
Solomon’s palace was filled with ashes and rose from the terraces, and the reception was at the same time consumed with wine, which they were just the ones.
The wine was made only of wheat flour, so he could not use it for the purpose of making the bread.
In his mind’s eye, he seemed as thick as a palm tree’s leaves in the dark.
"And your weight is what suddenly surprises me in you," he said...
Except I don't know him.
He was sorry for Aileen, and for his own unnecessary words, because of her fear, which he saw in his eyes at the time when Ailen decided to stand against him.
Did Ailn think he could find it?
He had never told Kevin about living in a beautiful northern island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that in the north it was the same as life here.
The same great, good sea that turned against them.
The same men, indeed, even worse and worse after TAPAHTUENEN, than their smuggler and kidnapper attack, went to the pub, ready to kill any woman who believed to oppose or persecute them.
The head of the pack?
He'd still see the fat guy, if he hadn't been careful!
For the first time, Imuta – the kiss had become the most common word of a man and woman’s unique encounter; the response of the recipient to the love ballast outside the pumps, the first and then the attack.
It was too much for Kevin to think of, for he had already been an enemy of himself.
The army of Solomon invited him to leave.
He took himself up as an old man from the terrace.
Alin also felt nervous, but the severity of Kevin’s death surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They must have known each other.
The gun followed his way — just as his traveling companion saw Kevin go up the window — to a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
When Adam left the tree garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevin and for the people in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to be an orphan.
So he turned into a man who had lost all the fighting gear — why did he feel that this vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that it would have been a few times before this moment?
When Alinn Solomon was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years ago, just before the event of a 32-year-old intelligent and enthusiastic researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the General Opinion in Offnow, conducted a brief study on the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in those regions where violence reduction or the end of the country was likely to take into account the money and energy used to stop it.
"The battle has already taken place, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "that the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and who have won most of the war, in particular in disreputable and strange places, where, despite the vastness of the church, people have rarely been aware of the times.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower it is, the more it's built up.
The nation cries out in pairs of sentimental ballasts, laments the stories of successful resistance and laments the good name of marriage and family life, but the old-fashioned freedom is not to be ignored when it takes over the rural communities and the urban community, and there is also evidence of a new, more evilr settlement in homes, workplaces, our streets and even sports areas.
"You have to apologize for the delay of dramatizing," after reading the full report of his guide's comment.
I'd suggest you read less Romans.
We were Nussbaum looking into the country.
Besides, I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer to my belief," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
First, we called on the right to remain neutral on personal issues.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I resist atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no pre-school classes in this place of work.
We are servants of a society that is unpretentious.
Although a certain superiority is entirely acceptable and respectful to you, it can, in turn, lead to wrong conclusions, to what you have just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church – and what you call a revolution or a bad thing, others usually call a natural energy force and a physical force.
If that happened last night, the earth will be destroyed by the fundamental forces of nature.
First Nussbaum looked around at Rabinowitz.
Following the head of Rabinowitz, a flame-like LED light issued a directive that had been distributed to the country by Offnow in the previous quarter or later of the century.
Listen to your neighbors, respect your partners, listen to the ballasts, go to music, use your phone, conversation, explain, listen to the same mind, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and singing speech is better than written, but nothing can love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a silent voice when he was sure that his leader had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively improved as we imagine we are.
I am concerned that, if we are not warned, we will note the same mistakes that led to SLIHEN, WHAT WAS IT, AND JOS TAPAHTU.
This time we really don't get angry and distrust each other.
Luther Rabinowitz became a pyramid.
This was the end of patience.
"Go too far," he said, "in your pictures, 'to be wrong' things that our ancestors may have done or not have done.
You're going too far to say that they threw 'his anger and mistrust on others'.
In your case, you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we do not speak of 'we' or 'we'.
There was nothing "we" or "some".
It was time for chaos, everything we know about it.
"If we're really real, that's why," Esme said, "there's no society that can say that they're doing well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done, was done, then it was good or bad.
It was then.
There's no need to talk about it anymore – we agree on this.
And just as there is no need to make accusations, there is no need to make corrections, then they were important or not, and even if there was any way to do them.
But what's the past for then, if it's not learned --
The past is in place so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz took his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and declared that Esmen was time to leave.
The next day he went to work in a normal way, he was hit by a long-distance motor vehicle, which during the course of his journey, described him as a “polluteracy and violence”.
It's happening.
The Lesothon Army refuses to design it; the Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The authorities of the Lesotho army have refused to sign up for the government and have said that they are working against the police, who are no doubt trying to shoot political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane withdrew from the country saying that the army had restricted his official residence and had ordered government buildings in the capital city of Maser.
The Head of State traveled with his family to a neighboring country in South Africa after he was told that he had received a death penalty.
The military representative, Major Ntlele Ntoi, spoke out against him and said that the army was so threatened that it was the last of the "political fanatics" that the police said they were trying to shoot the fanatics.
"The Lésotho defence forces launched a number of intelligence reports, including that some police officers were trying to shoot young side fans while preparing to cause problems," he told Voice of America's news agency.
According to the president of the Government of South Africa, Clayson Monyelan, military activities appeared to be from the government agency.
"Even if no one has claimed that he is in power, the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces show the recognition marks of the relevant government agency," he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho Army, soldiers return to the barracks on Sundays, and in the capital city there was a peaceful feeling.
Meanwhile, Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is leading the government away from the Taliban.
Thabane says she believes it's for action because she's been trying to fight corruption.
In Lesotho, there has been a show of zeal since June, when Thabane suspended the delegation's sessions because of the differences between the government of the great coalition.
He thus rejects the authority of the government, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Shopbook: Microsoft builds a data centre in New Zealand
Microsoft has established a large data centre in a new location where the company is not willing to adjust.
When sending Microsoft to the media, the company will ensure that it does not tell all its databases the location of security.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In the public, Oulu or Cajania was a former site of the center.
Microsoft will stop Oulu's office, which takes the place of work from about 500 people.
In Finland, Microsoft has already reported at least 1,050 jobs.
Microsoft correspondent Camilla Lindfors tells the STT that the company does not comment on how many staff work in the new database.
On the basis of the establishment of the Data Centre, the new country was informed by the Marketing Authorisation Holder on Monday.
A man is accused of a girl's superintendent in a traffic ticket
From 78 years of age, a man is accused of having a three-year-old girl in a traffic ticket in Fifes.
Gordon Stewart is accused of planning a girl in the street in Pittenween in the former Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart was driving Audi Q3 without warning and caused the girl to have an abortion.
Stewart, 78 from the Anstreth, refused charges at the Dundee Sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC appointed the Court of Justice to be held in January.
Four angles to the best hydrogen images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under the water, you have several different options to choose from.
The best option is waterproof, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both pay about $300.
I took these pictures myself, using several different cameras, each of which paid less than $350.
Despite the device, there are several rules that support compliance.
Always check your device twice.
Although you should also have a water camera, make sure that the frame and other parts of the camera are closed in a waterproof manner.
In addition, set camera description settings to accept pictures or videos.
Some cameras or camera and video camera combinations have a regulation that optimises the conditions under the water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure your hard drive can be taken.
Some cameras only tolerate 5 gala gravity, others even 50-60 gala gravity.
Known both to normal and water-saving models in our shopping and digital ratings.
Take a lot of pictures — many of them fail in some way.
In compact cameras there is a LCD display that can be used to paint when the action cameras do not often have this feature.
Even if you have LCDs, it's hard to see under the water, and some of the images can either succeed or fail.
Then take a few pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows you to take multiple images on a number of occasions by various regulations, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced in the heart.
If possible, stay close to the surface of your pictures in the river, lake or sea.
So you can also see more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get the point drawn close.
This is important advice in the illustration of the earth, but even more important under water because the weather conditions are weak.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide image, i.e. the artist must be close to the point in order to fill the entire frame of the picture as well.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – senior advisors
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong's voters should not choose proposals for the growing elections in 2017, despite the need for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give rise to long-term protests in the Hong Kong business country by planning and implementing opinions only after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the People's Congress of China will in practice give the Communists the power to withdraw all proposals which do not accept Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still cruel," said the president of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Peking promised.
They've lied to Hong Kongans.
It's clear that we're working with our own government.
Mr Li Fei, Vice-President of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese Government, saying that the general proposal to appoint Hong Kong's leader would be too "stupid".
Since 1997, when Iso-British was founded in Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised its citizens that it would have to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic transition because Hong Kong could vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to monitor closely the election process through the appointing committee managed by the Beijing Committee.
According to the new resolution, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In Hong Kong, the previous summer of the decision, some of the region's biggest and most prominent protests were held over the years.
Behind the democratic campaign was a large part of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which the organizers have threatened to prevent the operation of a business card, if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong the general right to vote.
On Sunday, just after the announcement of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong’s capital buildings in the port.
In the opinion, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would be transferred to a new statelessness period and that they would receive protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not clearly mention details of the fear that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In its release, the organizers said that the movement "keeps the Occupy Central in the last way to be used if there is no hope for dialogue and no other knowledge".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has come to an end and that the debate is going to take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing Peking's report for days, and Sunday security measures were strong near the government's capital buildings.
In Hong Kong, peace is a source of many of the feeling that the inhabitants are quietly losing their city.
The decline in landfills has led to competition for products and services.
In addition, I fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will be under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central business because its opinions threaten Hong Kong’s survival — a world of commerce.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to the greatest economic losses, depending on how many take part in it and how long it lasts," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long considered the move.
We don't want to make it public that Hong Kong is out of our reach.
Such an idea would be wrong for investment.

U.S. prom-preneurs to British universities: details for new students
We are encouraged to ask the students today to establish the first class of travel in Britain.
The company also offers other travel routes, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the best possible access to the University of Rolls-Royce.

The company believes that the service is required, even though most students pay 9,000 pounds per year.
Students today have been very different about their expectations and hopes than 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create an outstanding first effect, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Educational Organization has criticized service that is not realistic.

In this month, many of their studies are starting to slow down the cost of living when the financial support in the form of wages and pensions remains after the low growth of basic costs.

Hundreds of prison workers around Bulgaria expressed their opinion in front of the capital city of Sofia's Ministry of Justice.
In the peace speech, they announced that they wanted to return to the old working arrangements that were recently amended.

Korapello: Fani's encouragement is almost too much: Sasu Salin was turned into a mountain
Korapello Sasu Salin was today the physical beauty of Finland.
She was able to forget about her American treatment and shed the blood of the second half of Ukraine in her resolution.
But Sally moved all the honor to the Susifans and did it in the same way:
I mean, I was going to get to the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes of my son, I couldn't do anything.
That metal and the white general was almost too much for me.
The effects of the salin were to be included in nine surfaces in the quickly desired, palm trees, leaves, and temples at the place where they occurred.
I don't know how it went like that, but I got into a fluke so everything worked out.
It'll only happen sometimes, now, at an even more important place, Sasu's failed.
It's my role.
Do all of that.
Now it was great to see that others were caught.
It was the whole thing.
The Salin is a group of pleasure players and spirits, so it is not surprising that his example reached the entire group's plane, which was too big and heavy for the five of Ukraine.
Finland in MM-kisses 32 years after the fall: The former left me a lot of judge
Heikki Montonen (, etc.) was the Finnish prime minister of the Argentine MM market in 1982.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's pilot fleet played the MM lottery last time.
Seppo Sirca was the only Finnish film in 1982 in the tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was a Finnish double-wave and the current player agent Jouni Parkka was the general player.
Kosone and Parkka remember a thing like yesterday: it was at the beginning of the day to come against France.
"The court game in the decision-making games was not fair," Koson reminded.
We've already won, and both teams have already been assigned to the backyard.
Sometimes the game went on.
We lost it 2-3, and then the bastards had more sex," he said.
Finland played the prime minister at Heiki Montes's command and finally settled to 17.
Now Finland is again among the world's electoral groups when the Polish MM tournament is arriving early this evening.
Many events have changed radically over 32 years at international airport.
The power values of the players are the same class as before, but the quality and skill are now more.
Players' averages have also increased.
The game is faster than before," he thought.
But how's it going in Poland?
The Finnish player's material has grown, and the burden can be shared.
I'm waiting for Finland to proceed from the beginning.
Then it can be hard," he evaluated Koson.
Seppo Circa
It was Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen, and Jukka Savio who had a successful course against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkka was a public player in the MM market.
We're hoping we'll get 17 places now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go naked," Parkkal said.
Lilienda Reino Kosonen was a two-year-old farmer in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkkö were fired at the Tunisia branch.
Sanaa and entertainment in the Buenos Aires Maritime Library are part of the rural group's programme in the MM market in 1982.
Kari Kalin (i.e.) joined his teammates.

Finnish tourists rescued the city of Cita in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog came to the top of the mountain, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered a great help.
On weekends Mikkelsen was looking for "national saints" on Facebook so that he could thank his assistant again.
Mikksen told on a Facebook update that he and his wife had suffered from Cita's disease on a mountain in Tortana.
The lost sheep could no longer walk in the wilderness.
I tried to put it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it go.
I tried to pull it up and take it a little further, but its feet didn't just hang, Mikkelsen writes in his journal.
According to Mikksen, help didn't come from the police, from a nearby hotel, or from the finals.
The situation in the darkness of the day has already begun to seem dangerous.
Fortunately, there were two traveling overseers who were willing to help: the Tampere Antti Soini and his father, Tuomo.
The men were visiting Norway's highest mountain at Galdhøpiggen and headed toward the battlefield when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Micklsen) was relatively peaceful in a situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells the night-sanom to send a message.
A few days later, a German man who had a helicopter also arrived.
Several cases were reported from the past to Cita, where dogs were slaughtered.
The Germanman came to our place a moment after us, when we had thought about what to do with the dog and put the dog down in his eye for a moment, Son says.
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: SOUTH FINLAND
The dog was sent down by a helicopter.
According to the call, the performance was not physically difficult, but in a difficult country, the weight was slow.
However, after about two and a half hours, Cita was successfully sent down.
After the accident, Mikkelsen was still looking for "national saints" on Facebook so he could thank them again.
The calls also responded to him on Sundays, but the Germans are obviously still unintended.
I don't know what I would've done without these candles, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel that I didn't thank them enough.
They certainly don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
The other night, the Songites were already at home.
They've had the happy announcements from Mikkelsen:
Susanna Mälkkiä is presented as the highest-ranking champion of the Helsinki City Orchestra.
In any case, the three-year period would start in 2016 and end in the summer of 2019.
The table also contains the option of two additional entries.

The name of the period of return is unfortunately "Oral happiness followed by Eric."
The section on the evening cover shall include the following:
Eric and Donna are discussing human relations, providing food for the hungry, drinking white wines, and remembering their love story.
Eric's a faithful businesswoman.
As the color of lunch, he's chosen a white one that's shining.

Absence of genetics is often misdiagnosed
A British woman was afraid of dying for years because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years to live because he had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Prototh disease (CMT). It means a number of family diseases that damage brain and spinal cord.
According to Charity CMT UK, the wrong diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases because they are known to be so little.
According to estimates, about 23,000 people in the Iso-British are suffering from CMT, which causes motor disorders, such as exercise, difficulty walking and drying.
People can also cause ignorance or resentment, and this is inadvertent and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's (FA), which has a very bad percentage of survival.
Rodgers believed he had to cycle before he was 18 and died before he reached 30 years of age.
Today, at 51 years of age, the mother of two children says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I lost every day, and I had to endure everything longer than others.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was tempted in school because I went and walked in different ways than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several surgeries to cuts in his legs.
"I felt guilty because I was so drunk, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home and checked the disease information in the library and wrote to the FA union," he says.
When I got the information from them, I was upset and panicked.
I thought I had to go back to 18 years of age and die before I was 25 and, between that, I would lose my full capacity.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he admitted that his walk had not been as bad as he thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just grabbed me and said, "Dear girl, I don't think you have this disease because you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you've suffered something much less than a serious illness.
Based on some genetics, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT is, I thought I was confused," he says.
Charity CMT UK will organize the CMT month to focus on the disease.

The Russian spaceship failed - the geese sent to the sex scene died
To increase Russia's space, five small geeks have died, says the Russian Federation's Roscosmos Space Agency.
The gescats traveled with the photon-M4 satellite for more than half a month.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning in Finland.
The purpose of the test was to study the growth and use of ghettos in an unpressed state.
One of the officers and four women participated in the trial.
Although the test sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
For example, the effects of stress on the development of gums are somewhat known.
By means of the effects on the ghettos, an attempt can be made to predict how the effects of the stress-freeness would have been at the same time in this longer period of time, apparently in July of New States.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death of the geeks and the deaths or deaths will be detected.
According to the News Agency Interfax, "sexex" Christians were left.
It also tells of the amazingness of the same photon-M4 that the fruit trees that traveled along the same route survived the journey, and they also gained prosperity.
France held a terrorist party at Nizza's airport
France held terrorism at Nizza's airport last night.
A 22-year-old man who was suspected of acting as a recruiter in Syria.
The French authorities informed us of the matter on Monday.
The authorities followed a man after he was kidnapped by a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.

Koponen: We have good opportunities to win
The hope of the Coripelago continues to be at stake when Finland faces today in the second round of MMs in Ukraine.
If the opening petition was expected for the United States, Ukraine will also belong to countries from which Finland should continue to receive the necessary gains.
Ukraine is good, but I think we have a good chance to win, Peter Kopone in advance.
Ukraine began its first session in the evening in the Dominican Republic from 72 to 62.
The team prepares my NBA-veterate Mike Fratello, who, in his country, is playing aggressively.
The Ukrainian opening player is the director of Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a hundred meters away from the world champion for three years.
The Dominican government against Jeter dropped 16 points.
Mr. Jeter will be quick to leave, but yes, we've been saved from such things before, and we have to get our standard protection against the government, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttöle promised that Finland would play better than before in the United States.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can make sure there's a normal pool in the field, Möttöl said.
Hollywood's claims are spreading through the net, part of which is guaranteed.
On the Internet, a group of low-level images are claimed to be made available to the public.
Among other things, an actor, Jennifer Lawrence, has become a victim of a "crowd campaign".
The website TMZ has published an angry comment by the representatives of Lawrence, which would seem to confirm the reality of the images.
It's a little detail.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence comes to be accused, the representatives are threatened.
According to TMZ, indicator Mary Elizabeth Winsted has confirmed that the widest pictures of her are real.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know these pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible pain was seen for this.
I feel sorry for all those who had been victimized by the hacker, he writes on the page.
Rather, the sampler Victoria Justice says in his own name that pictures go wrong.
There are at least about Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunstist, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Kristen Ritters, Yvonne Strahowski and Teresa Palmer.
"They don't do enough work before they get out of here"
FC Honka is currently in the last place of the Viancaus.
The comments of the World Cup Walter Reference post-morrow VPS are very closely described in the current agenda.
I haven't been a painter in four months.
But everything has to be adjusted," Viitala said after the 1-2 battle.
Hokka made a lot of defense errors, especially in the first half of the proceedings.
The tribe of Viitala was not in the wrong sense of defending himself.
This summer in Hong Kong has been a springtime, and for that reason the defenders have also changed to a strict wish.
In addition to the game story, many young players have been given opportunities that they do not necessarily deserve.
"The part doesn't do enough work before they ever get out of here," Viitala said without naming any individual player.
Hong Kong Prime Minister Shefki Kuqi was some of the same opinion as Vitala.
"I told some players after the game that if you come to train and play to keep your fun and you think you're a failure player, and you don't have to do work, you're probably in the wrong group," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of time to a young man.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when toys are constantly changing.
It has not been the same since two times since this time.
In particular, there has been a change in the scope of the defence.
It's the biggest reason why we're here," Kuqi said.
After the VPS stop, the dog is on the line line, on the other side with the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so there is still time for the espoolas to avoid breaking into the Union.
I've never picked up a team, and I'm not gonna hit it right now.
We're not really going to jump out of this line," the painting director Viitala threatened.

This was said by Corporal Officer Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played in the EM tournament against France in the Athenian Marouss Palace.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I remember the game when he was on the spot.
Also, they were about a hundred of the Finnishs who stole 20 000 spectators, or empty metal.
What would the Pehkon say 19 years later after the MM-kissian Finnish-Ukraine operation?
There are hundreds of Finnish fans in Bilbao, which are eight and a half times.
The EM in 1995 was the time for the Finnish corps.
The men were exaggerating their way to the end by winning, inter alia, in the Russian prison camp in Helsinki.
It would open the doors to Europe.
Everything looked good.
He was a promising young man, like Hanno Mottole.
Chief of Staff, Henrik Dettmann, was sent to the Mötölka Kilkiwijlä in the final team.
The race that I was thinking of was different.
Now I can say that Dettmann was very wise, even though everything didn't work out according to the manual.
After the attack, the cormorant was thrown into the heart.
In the Athenian villages, the Finnish were known to have a total of over a hundred.
A group of suppliers, players' cousins, Finnish corps dealers and some fans.
There are also suppliers, sellers and manufacturers, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown in unmanaged proportions.
I'm sure no one can say exactly what you're saying about Finnish tourists.
The estimates are between 7,500 and 10,000.
If there were any number between them, it's exactly unmanaged.
Here's an explanation for sports psychologists.
In the global economy, businesses move across borders.
There is still an opportunity for us to examine how we go internationally.
In increasing mobility, we can take a look at how our girls and our son succeed in the world, says Professor of Movement Sociology Hannu Itkonen.
Certainly in Spain and in Poland, there are Finnishs who are applying for life.
It's a joint experience.
Still, it doesn't explain everything.
You have to be strong in your own sport.
I'm proud to be part of the popular culture of sports.
It's less likely to go to sports than Berlin to look at art.
Without success, the masses will still not be able to move.
Let's go back in 1995.
At that time, Prime Minister Dettmann called for a corporeal union and the players to be professionally removed from the hippie dance.
It's been ten years.
Then the direction was changed, and the field operation was lifted to the foot.
The plane took the same movement a little earlier.
Now both enjoyed the fruits of the work.
As Ikonen says, both men have succeeded in producing their hippie dance, where holy trinity acts: sports media sponsors.
That's what the public is interested in.
And the media have taught me what such support is, to remember Ikon.
Can ballistics also move this massive interest to home ranges?
The range and flight decks are played on average for hundreds or more of thousands of viewers.
I think it's a good question, and I don't have to give you an answer that would be very good for the guys.
The other school believes that the interest is moving.
The other one's the one who doesn't want to make the land full.
This puzzle is ready for the MM whales, but in their basic thinking, the ranges in the home are not twice as interesting.
There's a challenge for the followers in the middle of the street.
Tonne for sale - about 1.5 hectares on the shore of the lake
Nastola rewards the trainer with the State Bottäs on the coast.
At the meeting, the government unanimously approved a total of 1,4 hectares per day.
In the future, Tonton will build a free-time apartment.
Nastola has been following Botta's success since this carding period.
He is being tested for dispatch to market Lachta, Lahde and Nastola.
It's located in Koskalas, on the Kärkjärve coast.
It has become part of Nastola's property as a part of the grandest real estate trade.
The area has seven buildings in the garbage community, six of which are cost-free by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved formula 1 in Belgium's participation in its fourth payroll this year.
He's in MM points five.
Bottas is a sinusterial and lived in his childhood in the Wild.
He lives in England today, but he always goes to Nastola when he's free of formulas.
Bottas has visited the upper school and youth schools.
Design alerts are coming, but I think it's for the poor.
It presents and tests them for the best time in New York at the U.S. Open-Technical Competition.
Ralph Lauren's mental - health testers are field-responsive people, but also the amateur, who belongs to the top of the university players, Marcus Giron, likes it.
According to him, boys help him to follow his own development and to fix his actions.
Women’s milk has been extracted from hops, from which the information is focused on the bottle and from there to the brainphones or table-to-board.
The antibodies measure the heart’s pain, breathing rhythms, stress, and acidity.
The seating unit shall be removed prior to the removal of the vehicle.
The design table has not been told the exact time for the start of the sale, nor have any clues to its price, Tech Times reported.
Rape Lauren is not the only company that offers smart ideas.
Californian Athos has been sold for intellectuals and intellectuals.
They measure sickness, breathing and physical activity.
The clothes pay a hundred dollars from the ceiling and the total unit of the payroll will pay two hundred dollars.
The technology was also written in Red Orbit.
Fixed How to Save in Schoolbooks
The cost of university studies in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder will start his second year of education to find a way to save the costs.
He developed a system in which students of later years lend their books a nominal reward instead of selling them in the same way.
"My math book would normally have paid $180; I paid for it for 10 dollars as a whole and for a thousand dollars," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying the Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last book would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he used $120 for them.
According to the Board of Directors of the University, high school students spend over $1,200 a year on education and training, but students have many tools to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly going to use online chat rooms and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, where they can use the book all the time and pay it clearly less than the students buy the book.
According to the Neebo Inc company, more than 250 campaign books are sold, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the issue show that about a quarter of the books of the university's library were booked in the morning, according to Neebo's president, Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
This is the simplest way to save money.
Network traffic
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay for the campaign's bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler's book "Calculus" is about $290, but the book is worth 239.99 from Chegg.com's online sales.
Purchased for use
The books used are a good option if readers do not disturb the memory of others and have spent the rest of their lives outside.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used for Chegg.com online sales of $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, told her buyer the book "Strategical Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used by Amazon.com only $0.42.
The new letter would have paid $48.
Professor Amherst's College Without Walls, director of the University of Massachusetts, Ingrid Bracey, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use the courses first.
In other words, the reforms of the new emphasis are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the weight of the old can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid again.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon script, eBay Inc's Half.com is recommended for the book shop.
Vacancy
If you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them at your course.
By renting you can save over 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, the rental of the "Calculus" book will pay about 20 dollars to the whole class.
Be informed of the rules of the rental company, such as reminders, the use of the pressure and the consumption of the following charges.
Renter, have your equipment: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the book purchase price.
E-mail
Getting e-mails instead of regular papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are purchased, where the right to use an e-book is paid to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg shop is made up of an e-book of "Calculus" for six months at about $61.
According to Bracey, many literacy students are saving most because many classes can now be downloaded free, while the books in science and technology can be very expensive.
The comparison of different sellers is supported by the choice of the option.
Joe Gault, 29 which is soon in place in Pepperdin's legal science, recommends that a letter be used to clarify the ISBN number, since it can ensure that it seeks the correct letter.
Before you're on the network, make sure the book is in stock, Gaul says.
He's studying himself through this stuff.
The delivery of his purchase book was four weeks away, and he finally had to purchase a book at full price from the university’s bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Factory is 20 years old
The theatre established in 1994 is opposed to unemployment, discrimination and passion.
They are welcome to all those who want to make an art.
It will be followed by the closure of the media for long-term unemployed between 17 and 35 years.
In the introductions, they often take place in society.
In recent years, there has been a massive depression Moderata, Minämin! - humorous reports of Narcissism and classics.
He believes that every person can change his own life.
Almost double the number of people killed in incomes compared to last year
This year, the number of people killed nearly double this year has been compared to the last year.
According to the Finnish Central Intelligence Agency (Spek) media survey, 55 people have already died in 49 different camps.
In the last year, the rate was 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
Over 65 years have been 11.
According to the order, the situation was worse in the last year, when 64 people died in the mines by the end of August.
The government's part of the pension is going on in the housing.
There have been 17 jobs, 21 households, and seven railways and other small farms.
Spek reminds us of reporting home security.
At least all household maintenance activities should be ensured according to Spek.
In addition, all should check that the starting-up tools are easy to use.
There must also be a ban on removal from all rooms of the house.
Children should also be told what electronic devices they can use when alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The supporters of the Nato summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds met in Newport City at the centre of Nathan's opposite Mars.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered for the Cardiff City Hall for the meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed up on the weekend and spoke with the condolences who had arrived from Belgium.
Young people were saved from Australia's Sinis mountain
KAKSI, a teenager, was raised safe as they were at night in the New South Wales region of Australia, in Mount Sinai.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went to the Blackhead Govets Leap after noon.
The owners were worried about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8:00.
Local police and assistants were sent to search for young people, and they were found at about 23 miles [23 km] near Bridal Weil.
The girl had broken her neck, and the man had fallen and knocked his head.
The police went out with the couple at night, and they were picked up safe in the morning.
The patients were taken to the Blue Mountain hospital by ambulance, and their condition was stable.
The Ukrainian soldiers were escorted from Luhanski airport
The Ukrainian troops have been evacuated from Luhansky airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the military were ordered to return.
According to Ukraine, the calculation teams have taken a rapid approach to Russian tanks in the field.
According to the representative of the army, the anti-arms have been so careful that as a bomb, it is likely that Russian professionals are Russians.
Seven Ukrainian soldiers have died in the past year.
On the west coast of Kaakkois-Ukraine, the Ukrainian Party's participation last night was announced by the border guard.
Eight marine soldiers have been saved and two are still in chains.
The border guard did not have any certainty about the start of the attack.
The separatists had already told me about the beginning of their shooting last night on social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia is not going to attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that the Ukrainian troops be immediately informed of positions they could not become citizens.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the negotiations in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and Estonia should have an immediate effect without conditions.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia should respond to any new economic package.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we are going to take the conclusions of our partners' actions, Lavrov threatened.
The banks arrived in Malmön and Köpenhamn
Losses came on Sundays in Malmö and Copenhagen when the coastal islands landed in South Russia and Denmark.
The floods would cover many of you, combine traffic, and bury cars on the ground.
The authorities estimated that on Sundays it would be possible to endure the drought, even though the salts were predicted to cease as manganeses.
The heavy ports were able to surprise the Russian authorities, and they were not given prior notice.
The day-to-day meteorologist Ari Mustala of the Finnish Air Station estimated that the affected area was very local.
The seed area looks like a cape and a permanent place.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France," said the finalist, Francois Hollande.
Valls strongly urged the left to "show his feelings" to the socialist president in difficulty, who at the meeting of the new government did not receive the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our task is to stay with him," said Valls and deserved the applause.
The lively prime minister asked the government to leave a quiet 35-hour job in France, despite the fact that the new Minister for Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron was given this week, to discuss the proposal that the rule should be rejected.
On Saturday, Holland asked socialists to work together with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubura, led a different approach to the meeting of the socialist representatives who presented different opinions and criticised the socialist side of the fact that it allowed France's promise of a future.
Marine Le Pen, Head of the National Alliance of Foreign Affairs, praised the continuing socialist discrimination and said that Valls did not believe in the new government for a few months longer.
Frances Holland has been on the verge of a war, but also Manuel Walls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not endure for some time.
"And no new government will endure from being hot or cold," Le Pen told the suppliers.
He reiterated his side of the proposal to overthrow the delegation and certainly held a vote in the previous elections, and he himself would be ready to lead the side.
The French government suffered in March's civil war, and the criminal justice in the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion of the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the socialist party may launch a number of competing groups before the end of the Netherlands in 2017.
Political researcher Pascal Perrineau of the University warned that the French will soon lose their patience if the new socialist administration succeeds in improving economic and predicting unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must take note of the change is taking place quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could be worse than it was before.
The Pokka Poudan Pouka was badly injured by the Finnish authorities Kirsi Alm-Siran, Nina Rahkolan and meteorologist Pekka Poudan in the affected part of the program.
In the morning, the Finnish programme would be published on the last Thursday on Facebook, on the video of the autumn tours.
Videomakers Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to heal Huomenta Suomen's reputation for the next day, but the wedding doesn't go very well.
Alm-Siira listens to her words when she tries to speak her budgets, and her society also gets to lose her kiss after her second time.
And these fans should be allowed to receive a direct message tomorrow morning, as the Finnish Facebook update says.
The video has been very popular on Facebook and it has been enjoyed and distributed over 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, was employed at the library’s painting office in 1972.
There's Israeli Prime Minister Gold Meir in the picture.
A meeting of the Socialist International in May 1971 was held at the building of the building of Fredrikinkadu.
At the meeting there were a lot of government officials and security measures were great.
When Golda Meir went to the water, seven spirit guards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we were given five minutes to paint.
I took this picture four feet away.
The light and the dust were on their way.
Right away, I realized I had a success this time.
Meir's appearance shows that the Middle East leaders have had a difficult time before.
Then, in the contest, you came across the people you knew or the pictures you had taken from you.
It is great that today you can also succeed in other ways, as there is an ideal and visual rule.
Second, this is the best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's missing picture of Munich's Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Location: Aarnio survey has already paid over EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the police unit in Helsinki has already paid more than EUR 5 million and has demanded 30-50 employees.
This was assessed by Jyri Rajamäki at the University of Jyväskyl in the field of computer technology.
The border also points out that monitoring the legality of police activities and combating crime could be significantly improved by harmonizing research and judicial information systems.
According to the border, modern technology allows the multi-use of a criminal substance.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where data to be collected for the purpose of the crime is automatically filled with electronic evidence and also enables the scope of legal certainty.
We'll just check it out tonight.
More: 1999 report on the growing area of the school was forgotten: "fish and canals belonging to catalytic species"
The picture of the special information at the school of the Procurable Women's School on the wall caused a social media event, told Yle on the website.
The growers!
Fish and canaries belonging to the school population were grown.
Only when the meat is on the list, we're preparing a growth shift!
That's what happens at school when you forget about it, 15 years old.
You'll be able to look out of here.
Social media has been able to send people back to the town of Pirkela.
The Chief of Food and Cleaning Service Arja Varma tells Yle that the forgotten child does not take his place and should have taken away the time then.
Obviously, before my arrival, there have sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed during the discussion with health care.
Every student gets his career according to his hopes, he's doing it to the Lord.
On this day, students in the school of Pirkela offer a change in the diet only to the parent’s consent and to the evidence of a doctor or healthcare professional’s age.
The burden is based on the solution to the General that young people's growth tests may leave the stage of treatment necessary and the lack of meat or meat can awaken the wonder of the students' parents.
About 3 billion dollars from the Prestige Cruise Agreement near Norway Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest rail company, will negotiate to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
By way of trade, the Norwegian Cruise company, whose market value is $6.8 billion, would have been used by Prestige Cruises and save customers in its ongoing competition against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
According to sources, information on the possible contract can already be made public this week, and it is also possible that negotiations do not produce results.
Prestige Cruises, the private capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want a name for the public because negotiations were not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
There are 13 railway stations in Norway, including the North America, the Mediterranean, the East, North America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with a turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates in any part of Miami, stands for the Ocean and Regent brands, which are part of the total of eight railways, and the road map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than last year.
A $29 billion worth of cross-cutting industry is expected to benefit from the growth of developing economies in the coming years, such as China and India.
Companies will compete to achieve a common exchange of ideas for these new customers in their choice of routes.
Prestige Cruises registered for the first part of the US share market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares after the 2007 trade, which was worth $850 million.
The Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 at the present meeting with its Ginging Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The next is the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai skiing and casino company.
Apollo invested billions of dollars in the Norwegian Cruise company in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting's share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo 20 per cent and the private capital company TPG Capital LP was 8 per cent from the end of June.
The total share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies in North America is 82 per cent, as shown by Prestige Cruise, of the registration documents published at the start of the company’s operations.
The Tampere City Department is dealing with the matter today.
The animal hopes that the city management will begin to support the prison.
According to the Salla Court of Justice, the time of the delfinaries in Finland and around the world has come to a close.
Over the last few years, the world has been lucky to see that the size of dolphins developed like dolphins in dolphins is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be expected to appeal to Tampere.
The closure of the Delfinary is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question about Tampere's image as a destination, the Court of Justice notes.
According to the Court of Justice, the death of Nasi-delfin confirms the requirements of the delfinary action.
As I see death, it's hard to go on with Särkönnien's delfinary in the past.
It is time to put a point to death, close the Delphine Prison, and start to find out how Tampere's dolphins could be transferred to the coastal area, some sort of dolphin shelter, which is required.
The nose did not try to return to the original life environment of dolphins, but hopefully the end of the dolphins living in Särkönnies were still trying to live other lives than in an improbable concrete.
The Animal Protection Association aims to prohibit the use of all animal species in the circles of the veterinary medicinal products.
This group also includes delfinaries.
The Court of Justice will take part in the request for the support of the Executive Director of the animal for the consideration of the delfinine in order to date 1.9.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki, in its opinion, will take a position against the Delphine Action Plan in Japan.
During the hunting period, about 2300 dolphins are arrested or killed annually, either for use or for food by dolphins.
Putin requires Kiova to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on the new state
Russia's President Vladimir Putin urged Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separate factions in the east and immediately start negotiations on the different "states" region.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that part of Russia should be part of the former part of Ukraine, but that its position within Ukraine should be refocused in order to give the Russian-speaking people the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The demand for negotiations with Russian Cypriots in Putin Kiovan's government is consistent with his apparent strategy, which he has followed up to the beginning of five years ago: he is trying to help separatists dominate the region and thus force the Government of Ukraine in practice to give the newly published Novorossian independence, which can help it to move from the west of Russia.
In an interview with the Government of Canava 1 TV channel, Putin decided that the Ukrainian army's attempts to reinstate the former Donetskin and Luhanski region, which the separatists had ruled in Moscow on 18 March in their own name.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently broken into the region of "Novorossia", "New Russia" – this term commemorates the days of the former Soviet regime.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are "misleading" as long as Ukraine's politicians carry out campaigns for parliamentarians held on 26 October, and the government's forces are attacking individual governments in the areas of civilisation.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organization of society and the position of the Kaakkois-Ukraine state, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateship" is linked to a broader identity, which has been discussed for months with the Kiovan leadership in its efforts to alleviate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultures and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only Ukraine's government can grant the former regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov says.
There is no debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal conflict between Ukraine."
The interim opinion of the Kremlin's representative, which was intended to correct Putin's 'bad interpretation' comments, stressed that the Russian government is dealing with the separatist occupations of the former regions in a different way than in Crime, where it is in practice looking at the region where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to join even Donetskin or Luhanski regions in eastern Ukraine because most of the 6.5 million people in the region are not ethnically Russians and because most of the people, according to previous reports of the conflict, supported the stay in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed at international forums would give Ukrainian local authorities the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give Kremlin practical consideration in the area of government that combines Russia's Crime.
The territory of the Black Sea, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is located by the Russian shipyard, as well as by the ports of the commercial sea, and historical coastal locations.
In the area between Russia and Rostovin and Crime there are also mining, manufacturing and metallic wastes that produce life-threatening products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukraine's legislators, following new elections, consider constitutional amendments to increase the decision of the regions that were excluded from the Ukraine's nuclear field from their own economy and language.
However, the vision of his identity appears to be quite different from the view of the Kremlin and the Moscow mountains of weapons and lions.
Putin presented his last request to the Government of Kiev to negotiate with the Russian Cypriots as equal partners after the Spanish advance in the last week to the Russian tanks and troops captured in eastern Ukraine from the former peaceful region on the coast of the Azov Sea.
The security authorities of Ukraine fear that the adoption of the independent Novoazovski city of Russia's support will lead to greater efforts aimed at controlling the entire strategicly important coastal region until Crimea.
It has led a massive civilian and military unit to build Mariupol. Half a million inhabitants of Mariupol are known as a city of steel, located between the port city of Novoazovsk and Crimea.
Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels on evening, preventing Russia's coming massacres in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been self-employed for 23 years.
"We'll soon get to a point that has not been returned," Prooshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders presented additional actions to enable them to be implemented if the Ukraine crisis was to be re-entered in an inconsistencies.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to take their position in the region of Ilovaki and the last week of the two Russian Pansary and 1,000 troops transferred to Donetsk to strengthen the difficulties in the region, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told the suppliers in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 troops to be sent to Russia in Ilovakia was replaced by a 10 Russian army officer who was imprisoned in the Ukrainian region a week later.
Milan's opening country made the Japanese director Keisuke Honda with a seven-year playout.
On the other hand, first, Sulley Munter and then Jeremy Menez were sentenced.
Lazio also got a game at the end of his career, but the painter Diego Lopez attacked Antonio Candrevan.
Lopez moved to Milan this way from Real Madrid.
Inzag, Milan's former attack camp was only half the San Siron Stadium.
A total of 39,000 observers were notified.
Australian velvets and Gabi Grecko at the bottom of the bottom of the tunnel
Geoffrey Edelsten has reported that he may have been betrayed by the hackers, perhaps stolen by his comfort and by the Hollywood A-listed Gabi Grecko.
In a recent world, the following year, Jennifer Lawrence’s group of low-level photographs were published on the Internet as a result of a wide range of advertising advertising channels.
The hackers have said they have a total of 60 low-level snowballs on Lawrence and other superstars, such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle, and samplers of Kirsten Dunsti.
The Greek pictures of Australian exhibitors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovskin and Melbourne are also evidently stolen during the iCloud year.
The list contains the names of 101 publishers.
In the last month, Greece, quoted earlier, said to the Confidential paper, "This is amazing."
All personal communication and images should remain private.
It is embarrassing that personal information can be stolen and disseminated.
In New York, Greece is reported on a comment case on the network "unfortunate" and says that the victims "know themselves to be humiliated".
The hackers believe 30 pictures of Palmer with this former boyfriend Scott Speedman, also in the group of two collections of Palmer in the upper room are on the floor.
Palmer's films include the film "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovski and Sugar Puncher Browning didn't comment on hacking pictures last night.
The representative of Lawrence told TMZ that "the issue is a serious breach of personality".
The sampler Seth Rogen was angry with hackers by saying: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible only from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost as its home base and grew to a significant victory in the MM of the Cuba airport.
Look at the photos of the fantasium.
Half Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red, but Finnish blue.
According to the STT, Finland won almost 2000 Finnish explorers in the Spodek region.
He felt like he was playing at home.
So much impact on the fans was our game, Captain Antti Siltala of Finland told the STT.
Finland was already at loss from 0-2, but it grew to 3-2.
In one quarter, Finland made six points of humanity back.
The kitchen was already running 16-10, but then the Finnishs got on a storm.
However, when Paris was on the ground, the charter machine couldn't be down because of Katowice's heavy load.
So the fans who finished Warsaw were late for the trial.
