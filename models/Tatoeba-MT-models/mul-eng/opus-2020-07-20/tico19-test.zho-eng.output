Between 1 January and 15 March 2020, a rapid increase in the accumulation of infectious diseases in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (COVID-19)
In various countries in the EU/European Economic Area and in the UK, the growth rate of the new vaccine virus (COVID-19) has shown a similar trend, confirming that although different countries are at different stages, COVID-19 is developing rapidly.
According to the experience of Italy, both hospitals and hospitals need to be better prepared to meet the increasing number of COVID-19 patients, especially those who are in need of care.
On 31 December 2019, Huang City, North Lake, China, reported a number of diseases due to unknown lung diseases.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Prevention of China reported that the disease was a new type of vaccine, now called Severa Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2.
Thereafter, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named COVID-19.
To date, evidence has shown that approximately 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections, or non-smokers, and most of them can recover.
In approximately 14 per cent of the disease, COVID-19 will be advanced as a disease and require hospital treatment, while the remaining 6 per cent will be at risk and require care.
The death rate for the hospital is approximately 4 per cent due to COVID-19.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the growth rate in the EU/European Economic Area (EU/European Economic Area, EEA) and in the UK (UK) and compared them to the northern Chinese province.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 to Italy.
EU/EEA COVID-19 cases in countries and Britain
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 increased, and the current evolution of the major epidemics of COVID-19 in other parts of the world is similar to China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a major epidemic.
In the magazine "European Monitoring" published on 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the case of COVID-19 of the European First Group of Diseases, according to WHO's definition.
In the EU/EEA, France reported on 24 January 2020 the earliest three cases of infectious diseases, which resulted in the death of members of the Hughan City of North Lake China.
As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and all British countries have examined COVID-19 cases, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 cases of death, of which only 17,750 cases have been reported by Italy and 1,441 cases of deaths since 31 December 2019.
Access to COVID-19 cases of accumulation and accumulation rates
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of cases reported worldwide by each country at 8:00 a.m. through official sources, such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EEA and the COVID-19 in Britain and to compare with Italy.
We calculated a 14-day accumulation rate of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020, as an indicator of the disease rate for the active COVID-19 cases, in order to consider the natural disease of COVID-19.
We also provided the total number of cases reported by each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. and compared with the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
EU/EEA COVID-19 Trends in countries and Britain
EU/EEA 14 cases of COVID-19 in the country and the United Kingdom, totally coincided with the Chinese province of Lakes (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, COVID-19 has been increasing since about 21 February 2020 and has been rapidly increasing (additional material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but similar growth trends (additional material) have also occurred in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain.
Figure 2 shows the number of cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020, and comparisons have been made with Italy.
It should be stressed that as of 15 March, at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had reported a total of similar cases in Italy within less than 3 weeks.
Our results show that the number of cases reported by the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly.
The COVID-19 cumulative incidence of infectious diseases indicates that vaccination is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Despite the different stages of national public health responses, the definition of the cases may vary from country to country, and the situation is the same for choosing to accept COVID-19 genuine medical examinations — including additional testing — of the programme of patients.
In March 2020, doctors from affected areas in Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed resuscitation, while the media reported that hospital and hospital resuscitation in these areas had reached the highest level.
At the EU/EEA level, the available data are only 6 per cent and 1 per cent (data not shown), respectively.
However, these information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to give additional attention to the current monitoring data on the number of cases and the number of deaths reported.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there was a significant difference between the number of emergency and medium-term care stations available to European countries, ranging from 29.2 per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 per person in Portugal.
This means that States may have more or less resources than Italy (each 10,000 people have 12.5 serious health care and medium-term care centres for 2010-2011).
ECDC has been modelled for the sixth time of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 on health care capacity and related sites and estimates of the relationship between the disease rate of each EU/EEA country and the risk of patients with COVID-19 in British hospitals and the risk of excess hospital care & gt; 90 per cent.
Since cases have so far been collected in the EU/EEA countries and certain regions of the UK and hospitals and hospitals and hospitals are often provided with services to determine the coverage of the population in the region, it would be best to provide information on cases and resuscitations at the level of " Standard Statistical Module 2" (NUTS-2).
The experiences of Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and COVID-19 in Britain are developing rapidly.
Therefore, both hospitals and hospital hospitals should be prepared to respond to the increasing number of patients in the affected regions of Italy, such as SARS-CoV-2 and the need for medical care, particularly COVID-19.
As the recent ECDC risk assessment points out that rapid, positive and comprehensive approaches are essential to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2, it is necessary to adopt and adapt responses if not implemented in advance, as rapid growth in the expected number of cases may lead decision makers and hospitals to lack sufficient time to understand and accept and adapt.
The rapid risk assessment also identified public health measures to mitigate the impact of major epidemics.
There is now a short-term opportunity window, which could be used by States to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, health care systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to be in the face of an increase in patients with severe diseases within the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of severe respiratory system (SARS) virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by 2019 COVID-19) has already infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, leading to the death of over 3,000 people, leading to a great human disaster.
Similar to SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of people being infected with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be spread by syllables, and similar symptoms may occur through different mechanisms.
While the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, it is more widespread and affects older people than young men and men more than women.
In view of the rapid increase in the publications related to the new ceiling, this document wishes to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the subject of this rapid development.
We will introduce the basic knowledge of epidemics related to the disease, the cause, the virus, the diagnosis, treatment, advance and prevention.
Although many problems remain to be resolved, we hope that this summary will help to understand and eliminate such terrible diseases.
The spring of January 25, 2020, became an unforgettable reminder of China's unprecedented outbreak of a new type of viral disease, which made it impossible for all to enter the entire holiday period and the next several weeks.
This virus and its major acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were highly synchronous (COV) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-COV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was called SARS-COV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in China and spread rapidly throughout the country, then spread to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has led to more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19, of which 40,000 people have been hospitalized and more than 3,000 people have died.
WHO warned COVID-19 has become "the first enemy", its threat may be more than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nej.gov/pubmed/), no more than 200 documents on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the first report on HIV, tuberculosis, pathology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment since 7 January 2020.
This text aims at summarizing research progress in this field of innovation science.
It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CV — the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, Explosion 2012, 2012).
We will also discuss so far the knowledge we have learned about the disease prevention and advance, as well as some urgent issues that are yet to be addressed.
In the past, CoV has been regarded as the source of human indiscriminate diseases, mainly caused by approximately 15 per cent of the general population.
However, the present century has seen two highly pathogenic human beings, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which were released in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, quickly spread to many other countries with terrible rates of disease and death.
Therefore, this COVID-19 vaccine is the third CV in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the City of Hughan first reported to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019 numerous cases of lung diseases that were unknown.
Seven days later, CoV series was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of death was reported.
At the same time, the virus spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, a report of the infection of medical personnel indicates that there may be human transmissions.
On 23 January, Huang City was closed and all public transport closed.
On 24 January, only 21 people had direct contact with the Luhanwan Sea market, in 41 cases of serious diseases, which were considered to be the starting point of infection from unknown animal sources.
On 30 January, WHO announced this explosion as a global health emergency.
As reported in the present report, the disease has spread to 50 countries around China and around the world (Figu.2).
The final scope and severity of this explosion are still to be determined because of the rapid development of the virus.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 COVID-19 patients with specific treatments) provided an update on this epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbbbdA).
SARS-CoV-2 may be infected by all age groups, but the main age is 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons are over 50 years of age and very few are under 20 and only 14 are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/10 million) more than women (0.27/10 million).
COVID-19 The collective dissemination is mainly in the northern and surrounding regions of the lake.
COVID-19 requires 5 (2-9) days from disease to diagnosis.
The mean subperiod is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from illness to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic Renewals (R0) to 3.77 (95 per cent CI: 3.51-4.55), subsequent R0 to 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected rose by 23 January 2020 and coincided with the time of the large population movement prior to the Chinese Spring.
The actual mortality rate for the medical case was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the post-adjustment rate for all patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 are gender (men), age (≥60 years) and severe lung disease.
CoV is a large package of HIV families with a single legal chain RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, i.e. α, β, g and d, of which α-COV and β-COV are known to have infected humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV packs of sugar-inflamming products (S) have been combined with their cells to convert their blood pressure into aqueous 2 (ACE2) and a DPP4 (DPP4), and then it has been integrated.
The RNA gene group is released into the cells; after the gene group is copied, the gene group RNA is formed into a virus-containing shell with a pack of sugar and a nucleotide proteins, and then integrated and released with a gene.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
As a result, SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of β-coV, with more than 99.98 per cent of the 10 random samples collected from the first U.S. U.A. market in Huang City, U.S.A.
Compared to MERS-COV, SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV in genetic matters.
SARS-CoV-2 bottles have been found on the surface of the human airway.
The study found that ACE2 was the subject of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, S products are weaker in combination with ACE2, which corresponds to the severity of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be formed by a new type of product code orf3b as well as by the product code orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFNB; however, orf8 does not include any known functional structure or baseline.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou reported that a frozen electro-degradable structure of ACE2 (cryo-EM) with a total of B0AT1, which is a combination of CFCs, has reached a distribution rate of 2.9 Å.
They found that the compound had an open and closed structure, which was grouped into two groups, and ACE2-B0AT1 could be combined with two S proteins, thus providing evidence of identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a treatment point for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and Middle House
As is well known, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the source of ovarianism and, in particular, human beings are spread through fruit and vegetables.
By comparison with other CoV systems, the strain is considered to be the natural habitat of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus, such as the two types of SARS, is coV — specifically called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZ21 — with 96 per cent consistency.
However, it is not yet clear what the central housing manager is helping people through the spread of infectious diseases, and its methods of dissemination are also being identified.
Ji et al. is a virus carrier from the spinal cord to the human, which involves the same source regroup within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in the state of China believe that, given that a coV found in the medium-term is a genetic equivalent of 99 per cent with SARS-CoV-2, in view of the potential interstellar location of SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1 per cent of the differences between two gene groups remain a major difference; therefore, specific evidence is still to be provided with decisive results (Fig.33).
The theoretical nature of SARS-CoV-2 is still very unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in the drying environment, at least 5 days below 20 °C and 40% to 50% of moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 might have a similar nature.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is effective for the external line and for the heat-sensitive — 56 °C 30 minutes; fatty acids, 75% fats, carbohydrates, excess oxygen, chlorine and other fatty acids, but Chlorine cannot be effective.
Mankind is generally lacking immunization against SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is vulnerable to this new type of virus.
There are no detailed study reports on immunization responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies on other coVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, when the virus enters the host, the resident’s permanent immunization system will first be identified by means of model identification (PRR), including C-type collection, Toll-like (TLR), NOD-like (NLR) and RIG-I-RRR.
The virus has been shown to be a combination of tree stem cells and type I infectious agents, which will limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the spread of viral antibodies.
However, the N-products of SARS-CoV can help prevent the virus from responding to immunization.
Adaptive immunization should be responded to by a series of counter-narcotics shortly thereafter.
T-Ban cell, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, plays an important role in the fight against viruses.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-like antibodies, and CD8+T cells to kill directly infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells produce a stimulating cell factor to help the above defense cells.
But, CoV can control T cells by directing T cells to die.
These include supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, which are also essential for anti-virus infections.
For example, the antibodies separated from the rehabilitated patients and the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system would create a huge amount of free base in the Department, which could cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst cases, would cause many organs to lose their lives.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by a combination of congenital diseases, is more likely to affect older people and pregnant women who have multiple congenital diseases.
In general, exposure to large numbers of viruses or immunities would be higher than that of others.
According to a study conducted on the most early 425 cases of diseases in the city, the average potential duration of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the mean subperiod was 3 days, ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that according to population statistics on 8,866 cases, subperiods were 4.8 (3.0-7.2).
For the health sector, effective separation times are crucial to preventing the spread of the virus to others by non-communicable infections, based on the most accurate subperiod adjustment.
As a practice, virus contactors or infected people usually need to be separated for 14 days.
Should the time of separation be extended to 24 days?
Inflammation is usually the main and primary symptoms of COVID-19, with no other symptoms and can be associated with nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, pain, vomiting, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced respiratory difficulties and/or low blood pressure within a week of the disease.
Seriouss will make rapid progress as acute respiratory stress integration, toxic prognosis, e.g. toxic acids and haemorrhage.
Even if there is no abnormality in lung images, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should also be tested to conduct early examinations.
A population statistics study conducted in December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was: fever, fever, inflammation 76%, respiratory difficulties 55%, fatigue 3%, and air support for 8% of patients.
Similar results have been reported in the recent two studies on family cumulative diseases and the spread of non-communicable diseases.
In comparison, a population statistics study conducted in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients were also prone to fever (98 per cent), nausea (47 per cent) and respiratory difficulties (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of the patients needed air support, more than the COVID-19 patients, and the death rate with MERS was higher than the COVID-19.
In the MERS patients, breast cancer (26 per cent) and breast pain (21 per cent) were observed.
In SARS patients, fever (99-100 per cent), dizziness (29 per cent to 75 per cent), respiratory difficulties (40 per cent to 42 per cent), nausea (20-25 per cent) and pain (13-25 per cent) have been demonstrated to be a major condition and approximately 14 per cent to 20 per cent of patients need urgent support.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 cases had reached 66,576 cases, and death rates were 2 per cent.
By comparison, as at November 2002, the mortality rate of SARS was 10 per cent in the case of a known medical disease.
For MERS, a population statistical study conducted in June 2012 revealed that 2,494 deaths were 37 per cent in cases of serious medical diseases.
An early study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 had a 6.47.95 per cent confidence between (CI) and 5.71-7.23 and R0 of SARS-CoV only was 2-4.
Table 1.1 lists SARS-CoV-2 comparisons with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in the case of disease, mortality and R0.
The data above show that the proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but mortality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, control of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
A collective incident usually occurs in the same family, or from the same assembly or vehicle, such as a cycle.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residency in the area of armed or other vaccines in the past two weeks before the accident, or close contact with the infected or the patient.
However, it was reported that people could carry this virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and those who had been treated at the hospital could carry the virus again, thus issuing a long-term warning.
The number of white blood cells (especially bacillus cells) normal or decreased in the early weeks of the disease.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, white cell count < 4×109/L — including bacillus count & lt; 1×109/L — was found to be reduced, high blood pressure levels of HCB and virus.
Some patients can see high levels of fat and fat in the blood and red blood cells, most patients can see blood C response to protein and blood levels.
Severe patients can see a rise in D-BDE levels and a sexual reduction in the number of bacillus.
Most COVID-19 patients can be seen with a wide range of brain images, which are characteristic of both sides of the film or of the lungs.
Patients usually experience non-traditional lung disease, acute lung damage and acute respiratory arrest (ARDS).
In the event of AARDS, uncontrolled cirrhosis, the accumulation of fluids and the conduct of sexual fibrosis would seriously damage the exchange of gas.
Types I and II Particle function barriers to the lung will reduce the level of the face-active drug and increase the surface strength, thereby reducing the ability to spread the lungs and increase the risk of lung-stamping.
Therefore, the worst breast imagery has been found to be the most serious of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first analysis of the pathology of COVID-19 found a drop in blood cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, translucent formation, intercellular fibrosis and multi-nuclear cells, consistent with virus infection and ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main criteria for investigating COVID-19 via reverse-combinant combination response (RT-PCR).
However, given that the higher chance rates may increase the risk of infection, China began using a laboratory exercise on February 13, 2020 (but no longer relying solely on RT-PCR).
Something similar happened during the investigation of SARS.
Therefore, in line with the history of the disease, hospital examinations and the results of imaging are essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the team reported on a program using SARS-CoV-2 based on CRISPR, which did not require a complex tool, using a test paper that could only be tested for 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (saras-coV-2 RNA) every 10-100 micronucleus.
If this new technology is certified in the next bed sample, it is expected that it will significantly increase the flexibility and ease of examination.
Because of the lack of experience in the new treatment-type CoV, doctors provide support primarily for patients with COVID-19, while trying to use or propose other coVs — such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV — and other pathogens (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatment methods, such as anti-virus drugs, immunization agents, strains, recovery of the patient's blood clots, medicaments and psychological support.
It is even recommended that the blood of patients who have recovered be used for treatment.
The pharmaceutical company is developing antibodies and vaccines aimed at the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have a lower degree of attack on the main lung department at the beginning of the attack on other ACE2 organs, such as kidney systems and tumors.
Nevertheless, respiratory impairment and depression are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for mitigating and saving lives, including conventional and high-fluorinated ozone, non-invasive and mechanical air, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory system symptoms must be supported by ECMO, which is an improved heart-to-heart technique to treat heart or breathing at risk of life.
In addition, the maintenance of the electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of infections and toxic fungi and the protection of important organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
As is well known, the excessive response of patients with SARS and MERS to the immune system would lead to the cyclical storm.
Cellular violence is a form of an all-body reaction, characterized by the release of a number of cells, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, INN , IFN β, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cells will lead to the release of large amounts of free cells, which are the main causes of ArDS and multi-organism degradation.
Immunization is crucial in the treatment of cirrhosis of cells, especially in patients with severe diseases.
Skin resistance and toxin resistance — an IL6 resistance — have been used for the treatment of cell causes.
Other methods of immunization of cells related to the storm include: adjustment of T cells to immunization; stopping IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; BONA resistance; cell cell cell signal transmission agents 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
The strain is widely used as immunization agents to treat SARS in order to reduce the severity of the disease.
However, severe lung damage of patients with SARS and COVID-19 is of no benefit to the major drug categories.
On the contrary, they may have a serious side effect, especially in the absence of blood clots, which can have a serious effect after precipitation.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 patients are advised to use short-term treatment with low-productive skin strengths.
Effective anti-virus treatment has not yet been established in the preparation of this text.
However, a COVID-19 patient from the United States has been found to be effective.
Red Sea is a new anti-virus drug developed by Gilead, which is initially used to treat diseases caused by Ebola virus and Malburg virus.
Later, it also proved that Red Sea may contain other single-line RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS virus.
For these reasons, Gilead has provided the drug to China to carry out two hospital trials for SARS-CoV-2 infected people, with expected results.
In addition, it has been recommended that Barrick replaces, A-infection, Lopiaeva/Litowana and Libavelin be used as a potential treatment for patients with acute respiratory disease.
Los Angeles/Litowana treatment may result in nausea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The interaction between these treatments and other medicines used by patients should be closely monitored.
The blood and antibodies of those who have recovered
Blood collection from patients who recover from infectious diseases is used to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect the health of individuals from the long history of infection.
In fact, patients who have recovered usually have a relatively high level of resistance to the disease.
Antibiotics are an immunization protein (Ig) produced by B-B-bacet cells for antibodies to antibodies and other organisms, which can identify and directly interact with individuals of the pathogens.
Based on this principle, blood clots are collected from a group of COVID-19 patients who have recovered and then injected to 10 patients at risk.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, while the incidence of hepatitis and virus was reduced and the level of bleeding and increased.
Before developing special treatment, however, it is necessary to perform certifications and clarifications in order to provide a broad range of uses.
In addition, taking into account the effects of treatment, careful consideration should be given to some aspects related to blood clotting.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immunization and lead to the aggregation of cells, which may be life-threatening.
The incidence of antibodies in the blood is generally lower, while the need for blood pressure in patients at risk is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce unique antibodies quickly to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, the most important and practical method is to separate B cells from the recovered patients and to calculate the code of genetic code of effective antibodies, or to select the necessary protein antibodies for the virus.
So we can easily expand the production size of the antibodies.
In China, TCM has been dealing with many kinds of diseases for thousands of years.
However, its treatment effects are largely dependent on the combination of multiple components in the case, but the treatment is different according to the diagnosis of disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to draw and verify such components or their best groupings.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients who have been mild to moderate or have recovered from the severity of the disease.
For example, it has been found to treat COVID-19 in effective treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients used TCM treatment, which observed the highest rate of treatment for COVID-19 patients, including Ganhu (63.7%), Ninsha (50%) and L Lake (50%), while only 30% of patients in L Lake Province used TVID-19 treatment and their minimum treatment (13%).
However, this is just a small comparison, as many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, the Council and its colleagues published a study on the treatment of alone-treated alone with WM and TCM.
They found that the WM+TCM group recovers, reduces the amount of time needed for the disease to disappear, and reduces the amount of time required by the WM.
The most impressive is that the incidence of the WM+TCM group (from light to heavy) is significantly lower than the single WM group (7.4% to 46.2%), and the mortality rate of the WM+TCM group is also lower than the single WM group (8.8% to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still require a higher quality of resistance tests, with greater scope and more centres to confirm.
The identification of TCM-treated or integrated role mechanisms and their effective components will also be of interest where possible.
The majority of those who suspect or treat COVID-19 will experience extreme fear of this high incidence of even fatal disease, and those who are separated will also experience pain, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, lack of oxygen and inflammation, and adverse reactions to treatment, such as loss of the skin type, may increase anxiety and mental confusion.
In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, a series of mental reactions have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, fear of occurrence, emotional mobility, mental illness, and even suicide.
As part of public health responses to COVID-19 explosions, the follow-up and segregation of forced contactants will increase the concern and concern of people about the transmission, isolation and contamination of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COVID-19 who are suspected of being ill, those with close contact and those who are in need.
Mental support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary scientific and health team to update clean communications through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 information and treatment plans and to avoid close contact with professional electronic equipment and applications.
Effective vaccines are critical for the distribution of links between the owner of animals and the infected person to the owner of sensitive shelters, and are usually a complementary means of anti-virus treatment in control of emerging viruses.
The industry has tried to develop vaccines based on S protein, to produce long-term and effective antibodies and/or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.
The virus reduction has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, prior to the launch of a bed-to-bed study, the effectiveness of these canal vaccines in the body of elderly people and their role in the protection of the virus infection in humans has not been established.
This is probably because SARS was gone 17 years ago, and then no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, because of the continuing presence of human diseases in the area of the virus, the Middle East region has continued to suffer from planetary diseases and congenital diseases and to spread to other areas.
Through the use of vibrating viruses, DNA proteins, virus-containing agents, namicides, virus-like bacteria and regrouping proteins, vaccination strategies for MIRS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The safe and effective vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunization bodies is a crucial task for the development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the long-term development of vaccines (mean 18 months) and the change in the dynamics of CoV, this challenge is challenging.
As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complete sleep process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually and with no background disease.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients have a high rate of disease and death.
Therefore, the pre-existing model of this disease is crucial to the priority of the establishment of services for health-care institutions, particularly in areas with limited resources.
The following factors may affect the predictive or post-preference of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: age is the most important factor that affects SARS, as is the case with COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 was mainly observed at 30-65 years of age, of which 47.7 per cent of patients were over 50 years of age.
Patients in need of care should be more likely to have base-based combination and delivery, and those who are significantly older than those who do not need care (mean age 66 to 51 years) should be indicated as a predictive factor in the end of the COVID-19.
Gender: men infected SARS-CoV-2 more than women (0.31/10 000 to 0.27/10 million).
Concomitant and communicable diseases: COVID-19 patients in need of resorption are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and heart failure.
Heart attacks are also the main cause of the death of SARS patients.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2 sunflower cells, which may cause COVID-19 patients to develop abnormal liver function.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and that they may affect one another.
The results of the laboratory test are unusual: the level of C reaction protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of disease or organizational damage, which has been considered to be disease, treatment response and the potential for eventual recovery.
It was also proposed that the severity of CRP levels should be associated with COVID-19 and that there should be a prior relevance.
In addition, LDH, AST, ALT and CK elevations can also help predict the end.
These tumors are widely expressed in several organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and released during the organization's injury.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of heart or liver impairment.
Major pathogens: The time progress in the examination of the images of the brain must be considered with other issues in order to predict the end and spread of COVID-19.
Constituent use: as mentioned earlier, strains are immunization agents, usually used as an alternative treatment for infectious diseases, in order to reduce the severity of the disease.
Due to the widespread use of large-scale body fats in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffer from a lack of blood bone damage and lead to loss of quality of life.
Therefore, in patients with low drug levels and short-term resistance, COVID-19 should be used, if necessary.
Mental pressure: As mentioned earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients were subjected to extreme pressure because they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and were observing the death of relatives and friends.
Mental advice and long-term support must be provided to help these patients remove stress and restore normal life.
According to the population statistics study so far, the prevalence of COVID-19 appears to be different from SARS.
In addition to copying in the respiratory tract below, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively copied in the respiratory tract, and in the early stages of infection, it is similar to other CVs that cause normal sensations.
Consequently, in the early or late period of the disease, large amounts of viruses will cause serious difficulties in controlling pathogens during daily activities.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV was considered to have occurred in times of serious illness, and most of the transmission was not in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 explosion is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making huge efforts, including the blockade of armed and surrounding cities, and the continuing isolation of almost all populations with a view to interrupting the deployment of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have caused serious economic and other damage to China, the number of new outbreaks is decreasing, indicating that the rate of development of vaccines is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that this explosion will end in 3 months and the phase down will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so happy.
Paul Hunter et al., estimates that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS, and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. established a model of the predictive effects of the vaccine, which considered SARS-CoV-2 to be likely to be infected by two thirds of the population worldwide.
One Canadian team reported that 2 patients who recovered and left the hospital had been tested in the middle of sars-CoV-2 and indicated that this new virus could be a cycle epidemic similar to that of fluid.
However, with the reduction in the number of new cases, China has already experienced encouraging signs that the current strategy may have been effective.
Ebola virus has been predicted to result in 100,000 cases of disease and 50,000 deaths.
However, through strict separation, the disease was finally controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 may change, eventually disappearing or becoming less pathologically ill-treated and human-consumptions.
A comparison of COVID-19 vaccines is provided below with SARS and MERS (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic and can be transmitted through sludge or sludge, even through direct contact with objects contaminated with virus.
The virus has also been detected in the lungs, thereby increasing the possibility of oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases, 41 per cent of which may have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, more serious preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, in particular medical personnel, social workers, family members, colleagues, even observers who have been involved with the patient or the infected.
The first line of prevention that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the perforation of the mouth; the use of outer sections and the N95 defenses (1860s series) helps to control the spread of the virus.
The outer sections can prevent the flow of liquids from potential infections in the air or attaching them to the surface of objects that may be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) can prevent small to 10 to 80 nm virus, only 5% of the virus can be completely translucent; the SARS-CoV-2 size is approximately 85 nm compared to SARS-CoV.
Because the virus can even pass through five external sections of the patient's right-hand side, medical personnel must carry N95 (1860s series) rather than the external section.
In addition to oral contraceptives, medical personnel should also be dressed separately in order to reduce further exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 in case of an N95 fracture; the virus may have entered its body through the eyes of the blind.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent glasses or glasses when facing patients.
For the public in areas affected by the virus or potentially affected by the virus, it is strongly recommended that all people use their own resources more frequently than when they are balanced, stay at least in the room, and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered to be the proper distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are an effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of virus into the world of humanity, based on its profound memory of the outbreak of SARS in 2003, its high-coV-coV-responsibility profile reported on January 7, 2020 should lead to high caution with SARS-COV.
However, until 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for the Prevention of Humanitarian Disease Control remained in the city of Anzion, expressing the vulnerability of this new type of virus, the possibility of human transmission, and the prevention of infections.
The information clearly eased the public's alarm, and the spring season was about to come and thus missed the key element of the regime's control of the virus.
The disease control body in China may take this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more careful when publishing a statement, as each word is essential to citizens, with a view to changing their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information coming from the hospital than to the official reports of doctors or officials; (3) more stricter control of potential hazards than attempting to prevent the public; and (4) more frequent targeted and effective practices to raise public awareness of epidemics and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak of a new type of virus by SARS-CoV-2 began in December 2019.
In writing this text, within two months it had spread to China as well as to 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the explosion of COVID-19 appears to be like the re-absorption of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential for the control of the circumstances and the treatment of patients.
Older people affected by COVID-19 are more than young people, men are more than women, and the severity and mortality rates of elderly patients are also higher than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients continue to spread the virus, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when it is serious, resulting in a high level of difficulty in controlling COVID-19 transmission.
This section explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is far more rapid and widespread than the SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the normal RNA test results of SARS-CoV-2 may be fatal.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated may re-route.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of spread of the virus.
Taking into account such rapid research towards COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
What's SARS-CoV-2 coming from?
Although 96 per cent of genetics found between SARS-CoV-2 and two types of SARS, such as CoV, we still cannot obtain conclusions from SARS-CoV-2 from the SARS-2.
What kind of animal is the spread of the virus from the master of the original habitat, supposed to be the fungus, to the middle of mankind?
If we do not know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut the channel of dissemination, and it is possible that explosions can be resumed at any time.
Although molecular models and reproductive analysis have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is in combination with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the atmosphere cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Will the virus also be associated with ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this vaccine last?
How does the virus spread in human transmission?
Will it become a global epidemic? Like SARS? Or will it regrow like flu?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is vital, but it may take longer.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice but to stop the virus and restore our lives to normal as soon as possible.
People who are infected with the virus are the source of the disease.
For thousands of years, fluctuations and adaptations have contributed to the joint development of the Coronaviruses (CV) and its host (including humans).
Prior to 2003, there were two types of HCV that could cause small micro-organisms, such as common symptoms.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Breathy Syndrome (MERS) have reversed the situation and has shown the devastating and lethal nature of HCoV infection.
At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in central China, refocused the attention of CoV, which was surprising to see its sister-infection, compared to its SARS-CoV, which was very strong, but low.
HCOV infection is a common human disease, so knowing that HCV is the source of human disease will be very helpful to us.
The majority of HCoV sources are osteoporosis and non-communicable.
Some of HCoV's central storage rooms are also known for human use.
The identification of the owner of the animal habitat is directly relevant to the prevention of human disease.
The interaction of the owner of the coV in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the human pathology mechanism.
In this summary, we outlined seven existing knowledge of HCoV, focusing on their history, the origin of human diseases and the spread of species.
It is important that we compare and compare different HCoV from the perspective of virus progression and gene regrouping.
In this context, we have examined the current condition of COVID-19.
In addition, the text focused on the successful completion of the housing conversion requirement and the impact of HIV progression on the severity of the disease.
CoV belongs to a sample virus Section, consisting of a group of complex legal lines RNA virus.
These viruses have the largest genetic group of RNA viruses, consisting of 2.6 to 3.2 million genomes, called "Covary virus" (CoV) because of the state of camouflage in electronic microsmokers.
From the structure, CoV has a non-substantial gene group with similar organizations.
About two thirds of the gene groups include two major re-opening reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab, and replication of multiple-products.
These multi-products were further processed and produced 16 non-structured products called nsp1~16.
The rest of the group of genes includes structural ORFs, including intrusion (S), packaging (E), phytosanitary (M) and nuclear (N).
Many of the ingredients that are specialize are also coded by different types of coV.
Depending on the differences in protein sequence, CoV is divided into four components (α-CoV, β-CoV, g-CoV and d-CoV), of which β-CoV consists of most HCV, and is divided into four systems (A, B, C and D).
System developmental evidence shows that the fungi and fungi are the main habitats of most α-CoV and β-CoV, while birds are the main habitats of γ-CoV and δ-coV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross over species, some of which have become important sources of human illness.
So far, there have been 7 types of HCV.
Of which HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are α-CoV.
Other 5 types of β-COV include HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-COV), MERS-COV virus and SARS-COV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause muscular symptoms such as normal nausea and/or vomiting.
In comparison, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the new SARS-CoV-2 discovered were highly pathogenic, causing severe respiratory infections among more patients and more likely to develop into acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and lung.
In the mid - 1960s, HCoV-229E virus B814 was released from the intestinal tract of normal patients.
Thereafter, more relevant knowledge has been collected through extensive studies of both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, which can lead to symptoms of comparability.
In fact, this harmless concept has been widely accepted before the outbreak of SARS.
The 2003 launch of SARS was one of the most devastating events in modern history, with more than 8,000 infected people, about 10 per cent of whom were terminally ill.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the MERS, the epidemic continued to spread in the Arab peninsula and the planet was spread to other parts of the world.
2019 The new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later known as SARS-CoV-2) is a disease that continues to spread (COVID-19), with a life expectancy of 3,120 lives and more than 91,000 people.
Warnings have been issued that the global must be prepared for the forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 large flows.
All seven types of HCOV come from the guinea pigs, rats or pets.
Several evidence shows that all HCoV's growth is caused by ovarian and viral adaptations in the ovaries are good and disease-free, but exhibits a huge genetic diversity.
COVID-19 Vaccines have brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
A framework for driving forces and restrictions has been provided to trace HCOV human diseases from the origin of the disease in the natural history of outbreaks of the virus.
In addition, it will guide or promote accommodation owner SARS-CoV-2, the search for medium-term housing and the expansion of animal housing, which is important for preventing future virus outbreaks.
In this summary, we have outlined the origin of HCoV human beings' disease, inter-mediation and mechanisms.
In particular, we stress and explore a common theme, that HCOV's genetic virus is usually not susceptible to disease in its natural habitats, but it is also pathologically spread to new habitats.
In addition, we have also recalled the trend towards progress in HCoV, and in that trend, there is a tendency that is often accompanied by a reduction in the disease.
In this context, we have also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.
Since the end of the 20th century, the animal CoV has been widely known.
Prior to the first release of HCoV-229E bacterium B814, doctors have separated different coVs from infected animals (including chickens, dogs, cows, dogs, cats and dogs).
In the past few decades, seven types of HCoV have been detected.
A brief summary of the history found in HCoV in time (Table 1) will provide us with rich information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E virus was released from the respiratory tract of respiratory infections and then developed into the WI-38 cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have headaches, headaches, nausea, nausea, frequent symptoms, and 10 ~20 per cent of patients have fever, cirrhosis.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the organs of the brain of the brain and continued tradition.
HCoV-OC43 Injury characteristics of infection are not significantly different from that of HCoV-229E compared to that of other respiratory agents (e.g. amphetamine influenza virus and kidney virus).
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widely distributed, mainly in the winter of the climate.
Usually, the pathogens of these two viruses are less than a week, and then they're about 2 weeks later.
A human volunteer study showed that HCoV-229E infection would occur in healthy individuals.
Only a few patients with reduced immune function show severe respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "non-traditional lung", is the first of the major diseases that have been recorded in human history by HCOV, whose origin is SARS-COV, the third found HCOV.
The first example of SARS disease can be traced back to the province of Great Britain, China, at the end of 2002.
SARS vaccinated 8,096 cases of reported deaths, 774 deaths, and spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to the supercomputer, it is estimated that each case may lead to approximately 2 post-disease cases, a subperiod of 4 to 7 days, and 10 days of exposure to the virus.
The first symptoms of SARS-COV infection are pain, headache, fever, inadequate and cold, and later respiratory difficulties, such as nausea and vomiting.
Diabetes cell decreases, and liver function checks are usually controlled by SARS, which is commonly seen in the laboratory.
In addition, cirrhosis of cirrhosis in patients with SARS has been observed in patients with congenital lung damage and increases in cirrhosis and cirrhosis.
Thereafter, about 20-30 per cent of patients need resuscitation and mechanical tension.
In addition to the respiratory system, many organs, including the kidneys and the kidneys, are likely to be infected and are often caused by cholera, which may be fatal in patients with low immune function.
The virus was first isolated from an open-air examination of a family of relatives from the origin of Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working hard to study HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was first discovered in childhood and spread among the elderly and patients with respiratory diseases.
In HCoV-NL63, the disease that causes it is common to see nephritis, osteoporosis, fever and cirrhosis.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was separated from one of the eight-month-old boys in the Netherlands who had a lung disease.
Although the virus has been found in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is approximately 4.7 per cent of the frequent incidence of respiratory disease, with high incidences early in summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the inhibiting of the cervix (also referred to as the globulin).
In the same year, he was separated from a 71-year-old man HCoV-HKU1, who was in Hong Kong hospital for lung cancer and respiratory problems.
In addition to the community ' s access to sex and seismic acids, HCoV-HKU1 reports are also related to emergency radiation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found around the world to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities of access to HCoV have been well adapted to humans and are often less likely to be affected by infectious diseases. However, there is also an accident and the cause is unknown, such as a more toxic strain of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these HCOVs are effectively disseminated and sustained in humans, their toxicity or pathogenicity will also be reduced.
MERS-COV was released in 2012 for the first time from a 60-year-old Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratories are cases of infectious diseases from the Middle East, in both European countries and Tunisia, cases of introduction have been reported, sometimes after-communicable transmission to close contact.
In 2015, post-transmission broadcasts were re-exploited in Korea, for example 186 cases.
MERS' sleep performance is similar to SARS, which is characteristic of advanced emergency lungs.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also experienced acute renal impairment, which has so far been the unique characteristics of MIRS in the disease caused by HCoV.
More than 30 percent of patients have an adjunct symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases of infectious diseases were reported by the laboratory, with 34.4 per cent of the mortality rate, making MERS-COV one of the most known and most destructive diseases in the world.
During the fall of December 2019, collective lung patients were found in Huang City, northern China, where a recollective analysis identified the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization announced that the continuing outbreak of respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was an international concern for the outbreak of public health events and called the disease the name COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with a 3.4% mortality rate.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate in northern China is 4.2 per cent, while the mortality rate in the region outside of China is 1.2 per cent.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections and manifest fever, nausea and respiratory difficulties.
Some patients will also experience hunger.
Bleeding is one of the most serious symptoms, and rapid development can be developed as an acute respiratory tract.
Despite a very similar similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, 82 per cent of the high-carbon sequences, they are grouped into different sub-divisions in the development of the system.
In comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, but is higher than that of SARS-CoV.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 infected people have been infected with pathogens that could accelerate the spread of the virus around the world.
If SARS-CoV-2 compares and compares to other 6 types of HCoV, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
Firstly, HCOV is very similar to the pathogen and the patient's persistent time.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of 6 other types of HCOV.
Next, the severity of COVID-19 syndrome is reported between SARS-CoV and 4 communities of HCOV (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the characteristics of infection SARS-CoV-2 are more common in community-based HCOV infections, including non-specificity, lightness and even non-sympathy.
On the other hand, a small part of COVID-19 cases are similar to those of SARS-COV, despite a low proportion.
Thirdly, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also showed the interesting patterns of community accessable HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the availability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the availability of HCoV in the community.
On the other hand, the availability of SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, remains to be confirmed after human transmission.
Finally, like other HCoV, it can be tested in the sample of the sars-CoV-2.
At least in some cases, the oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, whether or not it plays an important role in SARS-CoV, remains a clarification for future studies.
In addition, observing SARS-CoV-2 is as important as having periodicity as community-accessible HCoV.
However, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, such as disease and post-communicable continued transmission, would have an important impact on the final execution of the current COVID-19 vaccine.
All 4 communities that are sensitive to HCOV have been well adapted to humans.
From a different point of view, humans have been well adapted to this four kind of HCoV.
On the contrary, both sides may be survivors of the great flood of ancient HCoV.
HCOV and HCV patients have died.
In order to do so, HCOV must have sufficient copies of the human body in order to collect adaptation trends, thus limiting the cause of the conflict.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 continues the age of infection and the number of people infected is increasing, and it fully adapts to the possibilities of humanity.
If it can be properly adapted, it will be difficult to prevent the spread of human beings through separation or other infectious control measures.
Over the years, these four communities have been exposed to sexually transmitted diseases in the population, causing normal people to suffer from immunization.
These viruses don't need animal shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not yet been well adapted to humans and cannot continue to be disseminated among humans.
They need to survive and thrive in the owner of human diseases, and they may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable persons through one or more medium-sized and expanded housing owners.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 communities with accessible HCOV.
It has high prevalence, as is the case with community access to HCoV, at least at the same time.
However, it is higher than the incidence of community-accessible HCoV than the incidence of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it can be fully adapted to humans and it is still being monitored in the internal circle of the human being without a host or an intermediate host.
Prior to discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we have some guidance for the development of HCoV, natural habitats, shelters, the definition and characteristics of the Mediterranean and the expansion of the habitat.
If an animal has a closely related parentage of high levels of carbon monoxide levels, it will become the growing host of HCoV.
Parental virus is usually adaptive and disease-free in the home.
Similarly, the owner of the warehouse will carry HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the owner is a natural person and is the natural owner of HCoV or his family virus.
In contrast, if HCoV had just been born into the middle house owner soon or immediately re-born into the human body, it would not be able to adapt well to the new owner and would normally be pathological.
This medium-sized host can be the source of human infectious diseases as a source of animal diseases and then transmit them to humans in order to expand human infection and thus play the role of the host.
If HCoV is unable to maintain its circulation within the central housing, terminal infections may occur.
On the contrary, HCOV can also adapt to the central housing manager and even create a long-term location.
In such a situation, the owner of the central apartment has become the owner of a natural residence.
A recollective analysis of the prevalence of pathological data found that SARS' indexes and hunting animals had a history of contact.
The follow-up blood clearance study showed that there was a higher level of immunization protein G (IgG) of SARS-CoV in animal trafficking compared with the general population.
In the live animal market, fruit and a cat were found to carry virtually the same virus as SARS-CoV.
There was no further SARS report following the removal of all fruit juices in the market, which was in fact supported by the above-mentioned view.
However, it is reported that the basic complexity of the inspection of SARS-CoV in the wild or uninterrupted animal markets indicates that it is likely that the fruit can only be placed in an intermediate housing rather than the natural owner of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80 per cent of the different animals on the broadband market have SARS-CoV antibodies, so it cannot be excluded from the range of small mammals that may also be possible for SARS-COV in the middle of the expansion of accommodation.
All these animals seem to be the ultimate owner of the SARS-COV.
A study of SARS-CoV, the owner of a natural animal habitat, found a closely related strain virus called SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 (SARSr-BatCoV HKU3), which lives in the head cells of China.
These strains are sequential in relation to SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene groups.
The virus and other fungi virus are associated with SARS-CoV with 88-92 per cent of the nuclear acid sequence.
These studies have laid the basis for the new concept of the host of new human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have also identified several SARS virus (SL-CoV), but no virus can be released as a viable virus apart from a specific WIV1.
The human blood pressure converter 2 (ACE2) is a known SARS-CoV component.
Tests have shown that the WIV1 from the sample of venous pellets used pellets, fruits and ACE2 as the subject of their entry into cells.
Interestingly, SARS is able to recover the blood of patients and the WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest parent to SARS-CoV, with 95 per cent of the coagulation sequence.
Despite these two high-risk sources, it is generally considered that the WIV1 is not directly related to SARS-CoV, nor is the owner of the SARS-CoV directly.
System development analysis makes the MERS-COV and the CoV-HKU4 and the CV-HKU5 as the same group.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV using the same hosted by DPP4 (DPP4) infected with the virus.
The RNA of MERS-CoV depends on a more closely related RNA combination of RNAs in the development of systems with the RNAs from Europe and Africa.
To date, no MERS-COVs have been found alive in wild fungi.
MERS-CoV is the equivalent of coV-HKU25, with its close relatives, with 87% of the total.
Therefore, it may not be the owner of the Mers-CoV directly.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East showed that single-scaring is the same as in most African countries as in the Middle East.
The active MERS-CoV separated from single-celled nerve cells is similar to the virus found in humans, which further indicates that the tumor is the true habitat owner of the MERS-CoV.
It is also necessary to point out that there is a slight incidence of general disease in the mers-CoV strain, but observed a significant drop in the virus.
It is worth noting that the infected strain not only spreads the virus through the respiratory tract but also spreads the virus through the mouth, but also is the main means of spreading the virus.
However, the problem remains, as many MERS actually did not have a history of contact with ovarians prior to the occurrence of the disease, which may be due to human transmission or unknown means, including the species that contain unidentified MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a source of 96.2 per cent carbon dioxide.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to determine the relationship between relatives.
In other words, unless the future finds close to the same sardine virus, the sardine may not be the direct shelter owner of SARS-CoV-2.
It is estimated that the owner of the inter-animal habitat of SARS-CoV-2 should be placed on the market and killed by wild animals in the Vanuatu Sea, and that many of the first cases of COVID-19 are related to it, indicating that animals may have been transmitted to human beings.
A recent study of the microgen-based sequences showed that a dangerous micronutrients known as saline (Malaya) may also carry β-coV-related ancestors associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new vertebrate gene groups are associated with SARS-CoV-2 with 85-92 per cent of nuclear acid sequences.
However, they are also close to the ratioG13, with approximately 90% of the co-responsibility of nuclear acid levels.
In the development of the system, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 strains of virus, one of which has a more similar body interface (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, and with 97.4 per cent of the same acid sequence.
In contrast, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are greater, although the sequence of two gene groups is higher.
An earlier study on foot-and-mouth disease also reported that there was a similar relationship with SARS-CoV-2 from the lung sample.
The study has adopted different approaches and human processing and has obtained a partial genetic sequence of approximately 86.3 per cent of the GHG.
We can't get rid of saris-CoV-2 as one of the owner of an inter animal habitat.
However, due to differences in β-COV sequences related to SARS-CoV-2, there is still no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from the salts.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even shorter than SARS-CoV-2 and the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the β-coV associated with the wear of the rock.
SARS-CoV-2 is still to be determined on the path of growth in the molluscs and other mammals.
Although the highest seriality was found in the RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and the wear-in armaments, SARS-CoV-2, related β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 was found to have the highest genetically-genetric mean.
It can be highly estimated that the high similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and RBD between the associated B-COV and SARS-CoV-2 is caused by selective interference with progress.
Another contrast is that the associated B-COV with RTG13 is regrouped in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the regrouping is widespread in β-CoV.
The source of direct human diseases on SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, researchers have also studied the origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
System developmental evidence shows that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be the source of ovarian influenza, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are also found in ovarian animals.
The report states that the virus found in three North American vertebrates known as ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) is closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has a genetic link with another vertebral virus found in Ghana (also called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), which is also suspected of being an interstellar.
In order to make it clear, charts 1 and table 2 combine existing knowledge of known HCoV animal origins.
System development analysis has provided evidence of the historical intermediation of HCoV.
After 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from domestic species, there was a large flow of respiratory infections.
HCoV-229E's interstellar history is still unclear.
The HCoV-229E-coV-coV-related strains have been detected.
There's a sheep's α-coV between them.
A number of evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from the lungs to humans.
Firstly, humans, rather than sheep, may be in contact with ants in the common environment.
On the contrary, humans have a close relationship with the sheep.
Second, there is diversity and non-communicable diseases associated with HCoV-229E associated with α-COV in the fungi, while α-COV causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, no sheep has been found in wild animals α-COV.
Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the possibility of accessing α-COV related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, tuberculosis is the direct source of HIV infection among humans, including dogs, Ebola virus, Nipa virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that HCoV-229E directly spreads it to humans.
Or, although α-COV is a genetic repository of HCoV-229E, sheep and goats may be the transmission of the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as MERS-COV.
MERS-COV well described the spread of various species from the stem to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the human eye.
In its initial analysis of the origin of the slow MERS-CoV development, it was well known, and the subsequent findings reinforced this argument.
It is clear that the algae provided a rich variety of viruses for intersessional exchange and interstellar distribution of genetics.
Long-term and complex groups, both the tight social interaction and the strong flying capacity are a favourable condition for the potential "virus transmitter".
On the other hand, there's been several decades of entry into the cell.
It was well adapted to these nests, and it has also become a stable natural habitat from the owner of the Middle House.
MERS-COV causes very small diseases in these animals and maintain relatively low fluctuations.
It is an accident for the planet to transmit to mankind, and because of its inability to continue to broadcast, mankind remains the ultimate host of MERS-CoV.
The role of the saline (if any) in the SARS-CoV-2 distribution is different from that of the mers-CoV.
In particular, β-COV is highly pathogenic in the wearers.
They may be the terminal owner of the associated B-COV SARS-COV-2, similar to the fruit tree in the SARS-COV.
In future studies, SARS-CoV-2 must determine or exclude several possibilities for the spread of species from animals to humans.
First of all, sardine may be a shelter belonging to virtually the same virus as SARS-CoV-2, which is almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings may share the ecological status through mining or mining.
Next, the saline may be one of the new virus-related centrally expanded housing owners.
Human infection by killing and eating wild animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may easily be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need to investigate resistance to domestic animals and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may be regrouped and adapted in the third species that have been in contact with algae and algae.
The study of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to various types of animal habitats, three main factors in the virus have also played an important role in the promotion of cross-border barriers to the virus.
First, they have a higher rate of fluctuation in RNA copying.
In comparison with other single-line RNA viruses, the average annual alternative rate is estimated to be "medium" to "high", depending on the stage of adaptation to new habitat owners, approximately 10-4 times a year.
The immune virus has a collapsible carbon dioxide outlet that can lead to very high changes and decreases, even to life-threatening.
Interestingly, known nuclear-like Remdesivir (Remdesivir) can inhibit the virus through the control of such carbon dioxide and RNA dependent RNA combinations.
Redcive is one of the most promising drugs that will be tested in bed tests.
However, there are approximately 100,000 times as high as their host.
In addition, if the virus does not adapt properly to the host, its rate of change will usually be high.
As compared with high-frequency SARS-CoV, the rate of change in SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower and shows its adaptability to mankind.
It may be estimated that it has been adapted to another guest of humanity.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to well-adjusted mersrs-CoV.
In theory, a relatively small variation in the gene may have resulted in a rapid decline in vaccines and anti-virus drugs targeted to SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the larger RNA gene group has additional flexibility in genetic mutations and regrouping adjustments, thereby increasing the potential for intersessional co-generation, which, when appropriate, contributes to the emergence of new types of vaccines.
There is evidence of this in the vast number of open reading boxes and protein functions to the end code of the Genine Group.
Thirdly, in the RNA copying process, a unique "replication selection" mechanism has been used and often replaced by a template.
There will be frequent exchanges of links in CoV RNA in the process of translating as a compound housing.
The full range of high-level synergy sources and the AGEN Group RNA can reorganize a new vaccine virus.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as SL-CoV and COV-HKU9, there was a system of natural reorganization studies.
Interoperable with the spread of the virus-accommodation
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction between the virus and the host body is another key factor that affects intergenerational dissemination.
This text is a typical example of a regroup of SARS-CoV and shows evidence that there is a direct choice in interstellar cases.
Based on comparative analysis of man-to-product-to-product-sparing bacteria, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different habitats, especially through the S-product RBD.
Usually, the RBD in the proboscis s will interact with the cells and will be strongly selected by the host response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in 318 to 510 acids in S1 cells, which are combined with ACE2 and its compounds, to allow the virus to enter.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify the various animals of ACE2, including vertebrates, vertebrates, vertebrates and vertebrates, thus allowing the virus to be spread across the face.
In fact, only 6 of the RBD have been observed to separate HCFCs from human and foetal virus, 4 of which are based on a combination of ACE2 interacting with the body.
There is a K479N and S487T in the RBD of SARS-CoV, which may increase the genetic and physical strength of the vertebral product in humans with ACE2.
In other words, the replacement of these two types of oxygen may be crucial to human adaptation to the virus.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cells as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S Protein S1 is 30%, which means that the combination of S Protein with ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cold-frequency electro-surgery study shows that this combination of genes and strengths between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins is 10 to 20 times high.
It will also be significant to determine whether any other community is required in the SARS-CoV-2 distribution.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also combined with ACE2, but mixed with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoVs, such as HCoV-229E and 9-O-HcoV-OC43.
They may also explain why the above-mentioned virus has been successfully adapted to humanity after the spread of the host of animals.
In addition to the cell, the results of intergenerational HCOV are also affected by the dependence and limitation factors of other habitat owners.
The differences between these habitat owners, such as humans and molluscs and molluscs, may constitute obstacles to the spread of species.
HCoV must be deprived of the housing owner's dependence and broken down the housing's principal constraints in order to succeed in achieving the spread.
In this regard, the factors of decision-making in this important area of interaction between the HIV-occupiers remain to be identified and identified.
The use of the latest CRISPR technology could result in the independent and restrictive selection of all genetic selections of accommodation owners in SARS-CoV-2.
New HCoV appearance: Return to original point
The diversity of cirrhosis of cirrhosis provides ample opportunity for new type of HCoV.
From this point of view, the HCoV virus has become a genetic pool.
In addition, rapid transition and gene regrouping are also factors of HCoV growth and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein code genes may change the shape of the virus completely.
In the SARS-COV supplements, because of the separation of SARS-COV-related fungal virus, they found that they could codify different ORF8 proteins, and therefore ORF8 considered it important to adapt to humans.
At the beginning of human epidemics, 29 non-nuclear acids from SARS-CoV have been identified in separate viruses.
This deficiency is divided into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered to be an adaptation trend to facilitate the conversion of housing.
In addition, SARS-COV may have been regrouped with the A- and c-COV system, where a large number of smaller regroup regions have been found in RNA-dependent RNA combinations.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14 also found regrouping points.
Similarly, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV flow has experienced a number of regrouping events in various inter-systems, which occur in the sub-Saharan Arab region.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, regrouping events were also observed in other HCOVs, of which HCOV was regrouped with other animal embolism virus in its non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that the choice of workers may lead to an unexpected change in the HIV gene group, which is likely due to the reduction of the choice of housing immunization systems in the face of the virus.
One example of these roles is the lack of dual-nuclear acids in HCoV-229E, which led to a complete lack of ORF4.
Although a complete ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related strains and fungal virus, the α-CoV shows a single entry into the nucleoside acid and causes a change in migration.
In the end, however, it is equally important that the growth of the new type of HCoV is also driven by the pressure of the main storage unit.
After ovarian infection, the detection of non-sympathies or mild micro-sympathies shows a correlation between convulsions and cirrhosis.
From the perspective of physiology and physiology, it seems that the tumors were well adapted to the virus.
For example, cirrhosis of the immune system has effectively reduced the pathological changes caused by convulsions.
In addition, because NKG2/CD94 is controlled by the appropriate control of the NG2/CD94 and the lower levels of the interoperability constituents of Class I are shown by the major organizations, therefore, the deformity of the ovaries is controlled.
In addition, the high-level active oxygen (ROS) produced by the high-level mollusc virus (ROS) that produces high levels of toxic activity is capable of suppressing the virus, and can be controlled through the extra-carbon carbon dioxide-affected college, thereby providing high-performance pressure for the virus when it enters the new habitat.
More pathogens may also develop through regrouping, resulting in new protein or protein characteristics to be adapted to the host.
Therefore, three new types of HCoV have not been random in the past 20 years.
The virus does not cause or cause mild Myocardial infarction in the owner, such as ovarian and urticaria.
They have a large number of copies, and they will not cause a strong host immune response.
This is the reason why pathogens and cases of serious human infections will occur.
The severity of severe diseases is mainly due to the excessive intensity of immunization and the cellularity of the response and therefore the increased response of the immunization and the damage to the lungs will be severe.
In comparison, immunization reactions have been removed from the virus control in patients with no symptoms.
The same strategy for the elimination of immunization may play a positive role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The convulsions in the lungs are particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of Type I infectious agents should be beneficial at least in the early stages of human infection SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, NLRP3 MLRP3 is also present as a deficiency.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 pregnancy may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 is based on the general themes based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although 95 per cent of the β-coV-coV-coV-conformity is found with SARS-CoV, there is another 96 per cent of the coagulation virus with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the presence of seeds and other animals in the market has been found to be the same as SARS-CoV, there is still no indication of the direct intermediate housing of SARS-CoV-2.
It has now been found that, with SARS-CoV-2, there is a clear parallel source of B-COV, which indicates that it may be one of the central housing owners, or B-COV that may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or intentionally manufactured.
As a result of recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, the virus has become a concern for people.
The research on fungal and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the origin of HCoV diseases and the importance of animal habitats in human dissemination.
A large number of evidence indicates that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from osteoporosis, and that human beings are disseminated through central housing.
Since SARS-COV is a source of infection from the market between human and fruit juices, closing the feed market and killing the dead fruits can effectively end the flow of SARS.
In parallel, in view of the discovery of several systems closely related to SARS-CoV-2, B-COV should be removed from the feed market in order to prevent the spread of human diseases.
However, further research is still to be carried out on the basis of SARS-CoV-2, as well as on how to disseminate to humans through the wear of sandstones and other mammals.
On the other hand, there's been a long time in a single tube.
These bees are important transport tools, as well as local meat, milk, fur and fur products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to take action to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on Chinese wildlife markets and to eliminate all pests in order to control MERS.
In order to prevent further outbreaks of MERS, integrated initiatives should be taken to develop effective anti-MERS-COV vaccines in order to prevent further outbreaks of infection.
Because of our inability to eliminate these viruses, new gene types may occur, causing inflammation.
All kinds of human beings suffer from the disease virus in the wild environment.
In particular, there is a high incidence of musculoskeletal infections with the potential of human beings.
These humans have many opportunities for evolution and regrouping, leading to the future of a more accessible and/or deadly new vaccine among humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
We should develop better prevention and response plans following the severe trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
In fact, many viruses have existed on earth for a long time.
They will remain in their Lord's presence until there is a way of escape.
Although there are many features that contribute to the spread of viruses, if people are given education to avoid snakes and other wild species, human exposure to snakes and other wild species would be greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological situation of the haemorrhage virus and its natural habitats, it would be necessary to monitor the continued monitoring of mammals, and the fact would prove that this is very useful for the prevention of the spread of animals to humans and for future explosions.
In general, the most effective way to prevent the spread of infectious diseases is to avoid human beings from living apart from the owner of the natural habitat of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing in the outbreak of the disease.
First of all, if a strain spreads an old SARS-CoV-2 virus into rock, it would be useful to examine whether it is possible to share an ecological position.
Second, if the fungi play a more direct role in human dissemination, then how can humans interact with the fungi and be determined?
Thirdly, if the third species of mammals are to be a real central habitat, it must be clear how it interacts with the different species, including humans, the fungi and the mountain goats.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may easily be infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be conducted.
If it is fungi, the future is expected to find SARS-CoV-2 in the owner of a natural habitat or similar to it.
Continued research in this area will show SARS-CoV-2 the way in which animals progress, which is important to the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
There's a need to update the criteria for the diagnosis of "disquieting diseases" and "real diseases"
On 6 February 2020, our team issued a "2019 new vaccine (2019-nCoV) diagnostic and rapid recommendations for infection", which we have provided with experience and insights for global response.
However, 2019 COVID-19 is a new type of disease, based on the results and experience of the ongoing research and practice, and we are increasingly aware of the disease; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.
In this letter, we responded to an article on the above guidelines and provided the latest "COVID-19 Medical Programme (Seventh Version) published by the National Health Commission of the People ' s Republic of China (COVID-19), which provides the latest "study-like disease" and "real disease".
In December 2019, 2019 The outbreak of new vaccines (2019-nCoV) is currently officially known as COVID-19 (COVID-19), which has been designated as a severe respiratory composite of 2 vaccines (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global epidemic.
In response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick recommendation guide and, on February 06, 2020, published it online in the "military Medical Research" magazine.
Since its release, it has generated a wide range of concerns.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new type of disease, based on the research results and lessons to be learned, and that our awareness of the disease is growing gradually; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.hhc.gov.cn/) issued 7 versions "COVID-19 medical programmes " during the period 16 January to 3 March 2020 " , part of which has been substantially changed.
Now, our guide has received Zhou's comments, and they have presented a simple evaluation programme based on their experience in bed.
Their work has provided new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to this global epidemic.
We acknowledge their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their proposals also need to be updated on the basis of the latest "COVID-19 Medical Programme (test VII") and recent studies.
According to the seventh version (3 March 2020) the fact that a similar case requires an integrated analysis of a patient's history in combination with two underlying performances and that, if there is no clear medical history of the patient's illness, it is necessary to complete three underlying performances:
History of epidemics: (1) In the past 14 days prior to the outbreak of the disease, communities with COVID-19 cases have been travelling or residency; (2) cases with SARS-CoV-2 (nuclear-Testing Sun) history with SARS; (3) prior to the occurrence of 14 days have been associated with fever or respiratory conditions with communities from the cities and surrounding areas of COVID-19; (4) cases with collective real diseases (at least within 2 weeks prior to the event), ≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory diseases, such as in the house, offices, schools, etc.) have been affected.
Reproductive expression: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) image school characteristics with COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or decreased early white cell counts, and reduced cell count of bacillus.
The diagnosis of a true medical case should be based on a similar case and have any evidence of a patient's original or blood clearance: (1) SARS-CoV-2, PCR in real time; (2) the virus whole gene sequence shows the presence of a known new type of vaccine virus; (3) the specific IgM resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and IgG antibodies in the blood test; or the specific IgG resistance to sarcs-CoV-2, or ≥4 times higher than in the recovery period.
We can see that the second version (January 18, 2020) and the third version (January 22, 2020) increased the actual PCR test in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth version (27 January 2020) and the fifth version (8 February 2020) increased the original tests of the blood label; the seventh version increased the evidence of blood clearance.
These revisions, based on studies based on the continuing work of the best nuclear test kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as the respiration model, including blood transfusions, increased the availability of different labels and provided evidence for the inclusion of the solar results of specific antibodies in specific medical standards.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of non-traditional and non-communicable people.
Therefore, a process plan for Zhou et al. should be updated, as those who do not have a condition for bed disorders will be classified as "low risk".
In addition, the evaluation system needs to be certified in further literacy practices and studies.
Finally, we hope for more direct evidence and call on the readers to comment.
We recommend that we refer to and follow the latest guidelines in the countries where the cases are.
Our team will also update our guidelines in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports on a new example of 5 cases of death from COVID-19 and new career days
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the new case of COVID-19 of death.
This created a new high incidence of each day of deaths caused by the virus.
As far as yesterday, there are 114 cases of infectious diseases reported by the Institute for Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh, where there are 33 cases of family leave.
Cumulative death 17 example.
At the online press conference, IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that there were four men and one women in these death cases.
According to Dr. Meerjady, there are two cases of over 60 years of age, two cases between 51 and 60 years of age, and one cases between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also indicated that there were two dead people from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 March that COVID-19 is a global pandemic.
An official of the hospital disclosed to local news media Anadolu Agency, one of whom died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Committee against Corruption, who had received treatment at the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Minister of Road Transport and Bridge of Bangladesh, announced that public transport time would go beyond the initial plan and extend to this Saturday.
This public transport stop started on 26 March, and the original plan ended on Saturday, 4 April.
Basics such as medicine, fuel and food are still normal transport.
On 8 March, two of the first cases of the COVID-19 reported in Bangladesh, two of them returned from Italy, and one of them was the wife of one of the patients.
By 19 March, these three patients had been recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 Global number of more than one million infected persons
Data from the University of John Hopkins showed that the total number of HIV infections worldwide is over 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52 million cases of deaths are related to the disease caused by the virus - COVID-19.
On the same day in the event of the border crossing, Malawi confirmed the country's first chance of being infected with the virus, and Zambia's first case of death related to the virus.
Korea declares that by Thursday, the country is one of the few countries that do not have the virus.
As yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1051635 cases of infectious diseases, including 79332 cases within 24 hours prior to the European Central Time at 10 a.m. on 4 April (0800 UTC).
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of haemorrhagic virus, at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reports from John-Hopkins University that on Wednesday, the virus virus killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
All countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to combat the spread of disease.
Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobayin, extended the city date to 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to receive compensation during the period of termination until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state ' s emergency status for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes, 10 abstentions and 1 opposition.
Saudi Arabia extended the ban on St. McGa and Maege and changed the ban throughout the day; the ban was effective only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to impose a ban between 10 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Mike DeWine, State Secretary of Russia, announced that the country had extended its residence order to 1 May.
Australia's store has reduced the number of health papers that have been sold every time.
On Sunday and Saturday, Australia's bonded stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the purchase of all their stores to two packs and one pack per transaction paper, respectively, throughout the country.
ALDI also imposed restrictions on the purchase of a package on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of information on the bank or on the Facebook page of the bank.
It is reported that buyers collect goods because of the fear of COVID-19 in order to prevent them from getting separated.
Wednesday, Woolworths will also buy the number of health papers delivered to the door for each package.
Before these changes, Woolworths and Coles imposed restrictions on the purchase of 4 packages per transaction limit on 4 March and 5 March respectively.
In its press release of 8 March, Cole reported that after the implementation of the restrictions on the purchase of four packages, "many stores still sold in one hour after the shipment", and that the requirement was "unforeseen", while ALDI was called "in the second half of the Facebook page".
According to a Woolworths speaker, last week's sales sales increased rapidly.
Last week, the Costco store in Cyprus would also be allowed to limit the number of packages.
In order to reduce further deficits, Cole bought larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery rates, and Woolworths purchased additional stocks, while ALDI prepared well for planned Wednesdays.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Russell Zimmerman said that the sellers tried to increase their stocks, but it was difficult for the local parliament to limit the delivery of cars.
He expected that the cost of production would rise as the vendors worked to meet their needs, while the specific activities would be reduced.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores would not be able to hold a three-week charity event after the advance release of the warehouse.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Technology of Queensland, said that stores would be filled every night.
He said that the health paper was a whole product, so the stock was small, and once sold, the bulk of the cargo space would be left to increase the sense of lack of material.
"Coles and Woolworths' view is that if there's a lot of goods on the market, such as paper and washable water, and enough, you might not be so scared. "Russell Zimmerman told the ABC news.
Who Gives a Crap said they're out of stock last Wednesday.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark of Health Papers and Solaris Paper of Sorbent Health Papers stressed that they were working full-time and had no rest at all to guarantee supply.
Domain.com reports that, due to the low number of sales made by buyers at the end of the week, some tenants will provide free health papers to the first competitor at the Melben Film Festival.
The NT press is a newspaper printed in Darwin City, which contains 8 pages in its 4th edition of paper, which is intended to be used as a health paper after the award.
According to ABC Australia's report on 3 March, the store was initially reluctant to implement the procurement restrictions, saying they did not intend to apply the purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman adds that the needs of other commodities are also high, including mouthpieces, hand washing, laundry, hand washing and showering.
Similarly, in addition to Australia, Ocado, over the UK network, has limited the purchase of Andres health paper to 2 packs per pack of 12 per pack per night.
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a major phenomenon
Wednesday, World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 (a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) is a major epidemic.
Despite the extent of the spread of the disease, but not the extent of the risk of specific cases, WHO noted the need to urge the Government to take measures:
" All countries/areas still have the potential to change the process of this large stream.
"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, said that if each country/regional community investigates, tests, treatment, separation, follow-up and mobilization of its people as response measures.
" We are deeply concerned about the extent of proliferation and severity and the degree of unexplained surprise. "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, this large stream is "exceeded".
He commented in February on CNN, "In addition to flu, there has not been a continuous spread of respiratory virus to the world since it occurs. "
Ghebreyessus expressed a similar view and said, "We have never seen a large stream of virus-induced viruses before."
He went on to say, "So, we've never seen a massive epidemic that can be controlled before."
Before entering the new state of the vast flow, WHO identified the outbreak of public health incidents of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute for pathogens and pathogens in the United States, said that the explosion was " most importantly, it was still deteriorating " .
By Thursday, the United States reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4600 deaths.
2019-2020 The virus virus is a continuous spread (COVID-19) disease of the new vaccine (COVID-19), caused by type 2 of acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
This explosion in China in December 2019 confirmed that on January 30, 2020, public health incidents that were listed as international concern, and on March 11, 2020 were identified as epidemics.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 161 million COVID-19 cases of global 210 countries and regions and some 9.7 million people were killed,
About 36.4 000 people.
China's mortality rate is about 4 per cent, and the global rate of mortality is between 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) and 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, nausea and vomiting.
And there may be lung cancer, acute respiratory stress syndrome, and disease.
The patient's potential is 2-14 days apart, usually about 5 days.
There is no vaccine or special anti-virus treatment programme yet.
Presumably, prevention measures include work-cleaning, hijacking, security distance with others, monitoring and self-restraint of suspects.
The official agencies have taken measures such as travel restrictions, separation, detention, risk control at work and closure of facilities.
This epidemic has led to serious shocks, sports, religion, political and cultural activities slowing down or eliminating the global socio-economic situation, and the widespread lack of supply has increased.
193 countries and regions around the globe are affected by national or local suspension measures, with approximately 99.4 per cent of primary and upper secondary school students.
The spread of false virus information on the Internet has resulted in hostilities and discrimination against Chinese people, other East Asian and South-East Asian blood and outer groups, as well as serious groups in the region.
However, reductions in emissions and industrial closures have reduced air pollution indicators, and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of lung diseases were reported by the health sector of the Huangan Province of Lake Lei, China, and began investigations early in January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the proliferation of the Wann Sea market and therefore the new virus is considered to be the common disease of humans.
The outbreak was called SARS-CoV-2, a new virus that was detected and was closely related to the virus in the sarcoids and SARS-CoV. It was confirmed that the first patients were infected on 1 December 2019 and that there was no apparent link between a number of South American market diseases that occurred in the background.
Two thirds of these early diseases reported in December 2019 have been confirmed in connection with the Vanuatu market.
On 13 March 2020, the "Sunwawa Early Report" issued an unconfirmed report that the first case could be followed by a 55-year-old man from the province of Lewe. On 26 February 2020, according to the World Health Organization report, the new reports of China fell, but Italy and Korea had suddenly increased the new cases of additional reports, and the number of new cases from outside China had increased.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially cases of leukemia.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of adolescent diseases reported were reported, compared with only 2.4 per cent of the world's 19-year-olds and below.
The number of cases indicates that COVID-19 has been tested and that the results of the examination are confirmed by official programmes.
As at 23 March, the number of groups in the world that were tested did not exceed 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries had also issued the official policies of non-examination groups, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March noted that as of 23 January, China estimated that 86 per cent of the COVID-19 infected were not tested, while 79 per cent of those unreported infections were the source of the disease reported.
According to a statistical analysis published on 30 March, Italy's actual number of infections is estimated to be overreported.
The baseline number of COVID-19 (R0) is initially estimated between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the United States Center for Disease Control indicated that R0 could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
Patients who cannot recover from sickness to death are 6-41 days, 14 days most commonly seen.
As at 10 April 2020, some 9.7 million people died in COVID-19.
As at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths in China were over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were associated with underlying diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. COVID-19 Official statistics on deaths usually refer to the official programme for the new virus testing results.
The actual COVID-19 deaths may be far-reaching statistics, as that data may not include untested patients, such as those in the hospital.
Part of the data from Italy showed that the actual deaths during the vaccination period were 4-5 times the number of new vaccines killed in official statistics.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) declared: "We know [the number of deaths published] is lower than the actual value", and the information on US data is also evidenced. The low assessment is often in the field of epidemics, such as H1N1 avian influenza in 2009. On January 9, 2020, there was the first case of cancer in China.
On 1 February, the first cases of death outside China occurred in the Philippines, on 14 February, and the first cases of deaths outside Asia in France.
As at 28 February, ten cases of deaths from Iran, Korea and Italy occurred outside China.
As at 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions from other parts of the continents other than South Asia reported cases of death, and several methods were often used to measure mortality.
These figures vary from time to time, and are tested by the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, early outbreaks of infections, age, gender and overall health. The mortality rate is excluded from the results of the deaths of the dead within a given period of time in order to determine the number of patients.
According to statistics at John Hopkins University, as at 10 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
The rate of disease in different regions is also different.
In China, the estimated mortality rate fell from 17.3% (patients suffering from 1 January to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (patients suffering after 1 February 2020). Other criteria included cases of death (CFR) and infection (IFR), which were seen as a percentage of the number of patients who died from the disease, and the latter reflected as a percentage of the number of people who died from the disease (including the number of doctors and non-smokers).
These statistics have no time limit, and follow-up is the whole process of solving infection and disease.
Many scholars try to calculate the data above for specific groups.
According to the University of Ouxin University, the rate of infection in this case is estimated to be between 0.1 per cent and 0.39 per cent.
The estimate of this range is consistent with the first follow-up test carried out by Germany to COVID-19 and a statistical analysis study on the impact of CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that this epidemic is manageable.
Explosion of peaks and permanent duration cannot be determined and separated by the region.
Maciej Boni, from the University of State of Benin, notes: "If it is not controlled, the spread of infectious diseases will usually take place after the use of existing housing and then begin to slow down.
But now we are almost impossible to predict exactly when this will happen."
In the view of the Chinese Government's senior medical adviser, Mount Huang, that if all States were to be mobilized, the World Health Organization's recommendation to take measures to prevent the spread of viruses would be "be expected for 6 months to end the vaccine".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London Institute for Health and Heat Medicines, said that SARS-CoV-2 " could be re-exploited and continued for up to two years. "
Neil Ferguson, head of the Ministry of Technology Institute, said that "before the vaccination is introduced (may require 18 months or longer)", the task must be to maintain physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner, from the University of Vandeburg, said: "This virus spreads very strongly, and I think it is unlikely that it will disappear."
The reexploitation of infectious diseases depends on the degree of immunization and changes in groups.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some of the infected may be unsympathetic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and constipation (68 per cent).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory problems, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain, headaches, headaches, chills, vomiting, bleeding, nausea, or vomiting. According to WHO, about one in six patients will experience a serious illness, and breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) will cause breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden unconsciousness, difficulty in awakening and swelling of the face or mouth as an emergency; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended that the disease develop immediately.
Some of the infected may not have an illness and have no symptoms, but the results of the test may be mild, so the researchers suggest that close monitoring and inspection of those who are in contact with real patients should be excluded from infection.
China estimates that the incidence of pathogens is low from 44 per cent to 44 per cent.
The subperiod (between infection and time range) is usually 1-14 days; 5 days is most commonly observed. With regard to uncertainty, one example may be used: COVID-19 patients with a loss of consciousness are estimated to be 30% at the beginning and then to 15% later.
Some details of the pathology of the disease have not yet been established.
It is now considered that the disease is mainly transmitted through close-to-distance contact and intrusion, when it hits or speaks; it is within a range of 1-2 metres (3-6 meters).
The study found that unscathed phalanx may lead to the most distant spread of the fly 4.5 meters (15 meters) - 8.2 meters (15-27 meters).
It was also suggested that the presence of flying in the air may also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus is not usually transmitted through air, it may also occur when people shout or speak.
It may fall into the mouthpieces of people around it, even into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as injecting and heart failure (CPR) may cause respiratory fibrosis and air circulation.
In addition, when a person touches the surface of the virus (including skin), and then again touches his eye mouth, it may also lead to the spread of the virus.
Some are also concerned that the virus may be spread through the lungs, but this risk is considered to be lower.
The Chinese Government has denied the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which is the most highly contagious of three days after the disease, but also of the post-disease period.
The first three days before the outbreak, this indicates that the new virus has had a contaminative effect before it manifests itself.
Although there are few reports of cases of illness in the laboratory, some countries have found that they have been infected in the course of the follow-up to the interview.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) notes that although the transmission of new vaccines is still not fully clear, the virus is usually transmitted by 2-3 people.
In particular, new vaccines have been known to live for the maximum three days on plastics (combined) and 304 non-saturated cells, and one day on the paper, and four hours on the surface.
However, their survival has also been affected by the humidity and temperature.
There is currently no evidence that animals will re-communicate the virus to humans, but the British official agency has recommended that people wash their hands after touching animals, just like the faces of other potential infected people.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus, first isolated from 3 patients with chronic respiratory system diseases.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural environment. Before the virus enters the human body, it is possible for the user to kill it because it can cure the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is now considered a disease of human beings.
The genetic analysis shows that this virus is a combination of β and β of urea virus-like strains of sarbecovirus, Atal (B η) and two strains of fungal origins.
The new vaccine and other vaccines (BatCov RatG13) are 96 per cent consistent at the level of the whole gene group.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that certain parts of the virus in the cell and in the human body are only a fraction of the acid in the gene group.
As with the current GHG, there are at least 92 per cent of the same genetic material between SARS-CoV-2, and it is not enough to prove that they are centrally located.
Whether the virus has been infected can be initialized on the basis of the disease, but eventually it is possible to treat it by means of a reversible recombination reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT.
A PCR conducted in Afghanistan and CT compared studies showed that CT was clearly more sensitive than PCR, but with lower specificity, many of the characteristics were more complex with other lung and disease development.
As of March 2020, the U.S. Radio Institute recommended that " CT should not be used to test COVID-19 or to test the disease as the first way to detect the disease " .
The World Health Organization has now published a number of nuclear testing programmes aimed at SARS-CoV-2 and the first programme was launched on 17 January.
Nuclear acid testing using a real-time reversible congenital congenital reaction (rRT-PCR).
The respiratory or blood samples can be tested.
The results can usually be obtained within hours and several days.
In general, this test is carried out through bone marrow, and can also be carried out through bone marrow. Many laboratories and companies are developing blood purification tests used to test antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, these methods of testing have not proved sufficiently accurate and cannot be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a blood test developed by Cellex has been approved, only for the approval of the laboratory in emergency situations.
The standard X-ray and computer-restraint scan (CT) of patients is a characteristic of the external circuit boulevard imagery, which is non-recorded and without chestnut fluid.
The Italian Radio Institute is compiling an international online database of images dealing with real medical cases.
Because of the combination of other virus infections (such as virus virus), the PCR confirmed images are limited in determining the specificity of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of the CT to the PCR results of the brain, although the image is less specific than the identification of infection, but the speed of inspection is faster and more flexible, so it can therefore be considered as a means of research in the range.
There has been a development of a collection of neurological networks based on human engineering, which can be combined with X-rays and CT to test the properties of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good personal hygiene habits, work manuals, avoid direct contact with the mouth of the unwashed hands with the mouth of the nose, sneezing or sneezing the mouth with paper or sneezing, and put past paper directly into the trash.
It seems that the infected should have access to the medical department when entering the public.
In addition, it is recommended that measures be taken to prevent the spread of the virus. Many Governments have limited or recommended avoiding countries and regions that are affected by the return to the virus when it is not necessary to do so.
However, the virus has now reached a community-wide distribution phase in most parts of the world.
This means that some community residents do not know where or how they are infected.
The Government's use of mobile position data for the purpose of tracking has caused private concerns, and over 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
There are currently various mobile applications that have been introduced or entered into proposals for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, there are more than 10 groups of experts working to study solutions that have private protection functions, such as the use of the Bluetooth record user and other mobile phones.
If the user has a close contact with COVID-19 patients who have had an excessive exposure to the resultant urticaria, they will be advised to continue to spread false statements about prevention of infection; such as sneezing noses and mouthing of mouth water.
There are still no COVID-19 vaccines, but many organizations are developing actively.
It is recommended to stop the spread of disease through the work force.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control recommends that people often use at least 20 seconds to wash their hands with soap and water, especially when there is obvious contamination, before or after meals, or when they are in their hands.
This is because before the virus enters the human body, it is only necessary to use the domestic tuberculosis to destroy its defense cells and thus play a role in the killing of the virus.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) also recommended that at least 60 per cent of alcohol-free hand washing can be used if there is no moisture and water in the body.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, noses or mouth if they are not washed.
The surface of the body can be used in several forms of fluoride (can be activated within one minute of the action of the non-ferrous liquid), including 62-71%, 50-100%, respectively, and 0.1%, and 0.5% and 0.2-7.5% of the combination of oxygen.
Other fluids (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons) are less effective.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control recommends that if there is a new type of virus epidemic similar to the disease or real medical disease in facilities such as offices or offices, such as day-to-day facilities, it should be applied to all regions, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic equipment, such as flat-screen computers, touch, keyboards, remote control and patients.
The WHO recommends that the mouth of the broken hands or paper should be removed when it is crushed or crushed, and that all contaminated paper should be removed immediately.
It is suggested that the infected may be able to use the outer ear of a doctor, as the mouthpieces can reduce speech, cut the volume of airflows and reduce the spread distance.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on oral use and methods.
Professor Stephen Griffin of the University of Lizziz, who said: "It is also a major source of infection in the hands of people who are suspected of being infected.
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy groups should wear shoes only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for the care of patients with COVID-19, but the organization also recognises that these shoes help to avoid eye contact.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear shoes.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended that non-medical oral syringes made of plastics be used. China clearly recommended that healthy citizens also wear a single medical syringe, especially when they have close contact with others.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended that you wear a belt when riding public transport tools or when entering a private place.
The health officials of Thailand recommended that people wash their mouth and wash their hands every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly prohibited from wearing or cutting their noses into public places.
On 16 March, Viet Nam requested that everyone be allowed to enter public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria provides that everyone is allowed to enter a warehouse.
Israel demanded that all residents be put together in public places.
China has produced up to 1,000 million oral days since the mid-May, and on April 1st, China began to demand that it be equipped with bicycles and urban buses.
Panama provides that it must be equipped with a wallet and recommends that residents who do not have a wallet are able to buy it themselves.
In Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore have also been widely used.
Infective control measures for maintaining social distance (also referred to as physical distance) are designed to minimize close contact between humans and humans, thus reducing the spread of disease.
Measures include separation; restrictions on exit; suspension of education, work and closure of sports venues, theatre or shopping centres.
In the area of maintaining social isolation, individual measures can be taken, including staying at home, restricting access, avoiding entry into the densely populated areas of the population, changing the approach of non-interconnected questioning and maintaining physical distance with others.
Many Governments are now forced to maintain social isolation in areas affected by the requirement or recommended by the impact of vaccination.
With regard to the size of the largest population, the initial recommendations of United States government agencies and health organizations were 250 (in areas without COVID-19) and subsequently reduced to 50 and then reduced to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned more than two public meetings. Older people and those with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory system disease, high blood pressure and immunization systems are at higher risk of serious diseases and diseases. The German Center for Disease Control recommended that these populations in the region of the region of the disease be as likely to be excluded as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began using the phrase "Keeping Physical Distance" to explain their purpose of reducing physical contact, while maintaining social connections, including possible connections and remote connections.
The use of the term "Keeping Social Distance" includes the meaning of the requirement that people be completely separated from society without encouraging communication in other ways. Some authorities have also issued guidelines on sexual health for the long term.
Its recommendations include sexual relations with partners who are living alone and who are not infected with the virus or disease.
It is recommended that COVID-19 make a separate separation between patients and those who are suspected of being infected.
The health institutions have issued detailed descriptions of the correct separation of themselves. Many governments have forced or recommended that all residents of the area be separated from themselves.
In addition, the highest-risk group has issued the most severe self-defence instructions.
If there is a possibility of contact with COVID-19 patients or a country or region that has recently gone extensively, it is recommended that 14 days from the time of the last possible contact with the virus be separated.
Vaccination/compression and mitigation strategies include vaccine control strategies.
Depletion is applied to the early phase of explosion, with the aim of tracking and segregating the infected, while taking other measures to prevent the spread of disease to others.
If transmission of disease is not possible, efforts should be made to phase out the phase of mitigation: measures to reduce the spread of disease and reduce the impact of disease on health systems and society.
The control and mitigation measures can be implemented simultaneously.
Controls need to take more extreme control measures to reduce the basic number of recurrences to below 1. Part of the control of outbreaks of infectious diseases is efforts to reduce the risk of infection, or the pathogens we know.
This would reduce the risk of deterioration in the health service system and allow more time for the development of vaccination and treatment programmes.
Non-drug interventions that can control vaccination include individual preventive measures such as maintaining health, dental care and self-restraint; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as stopping and eliminating mass collection activities; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as facial clean-up. In the face of apparent increased circumstances, China has taken more severe vaccination measures, such as the blockage of cities and the implementation of strict exit bans.
Other countries and regions have also taken measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The country introduced large-scale screening and de-region measures and issued a warning on the path of the activity of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support for self-restraints and imposes large penalties on self-restraints who refuse to separate themselves.
China's Taiwan has increased its oral production rate and has imposed fines on drug dealers for sales. The models of Britain and the United States show that slowing down (but not stopping the spread of diseases) and curbing (reversing the spread of infectious diseases) are a major challenge.
The best mitigation policy may reduce high-level medical needs by 2/3, reduce deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, resulting in a decline in the health system.
Depression may be the primary measure, but it is necessary to stop the spread of the virus in the population (or until the vaccine is released for the first time), or if the release is slowed, it will be rapidly re-absorbed.
Long-term interventions aimed at curbing epidemics bring social and economic costs.
COVID-19 has not yet been approved for any specific anti-narcotics, but development work is still under way, including testing of existing drugs.
The use of non-responsibility medications, fluids and rest may help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, it may be necessary to treat ovarianism and to reduce fluid loss and respiratory support.
The use of stimulants may lead to deterioration.
A number of combinations that have been previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine whether they apply to the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also notes that some "traditional and family treatment" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization noted that raising the capacity to address and adjusting medical systems to meet the needs of patients with COVID-19 is a basic response measure.
ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines on hospital and primary health services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the focus of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of optional procedures, separation and separation of COVID-19 sunbed patients, and the increased protection capacity through training personnel and the availability of respiratory and pathogens.
In the case of the first case (i.e. the number of patients) the suspects said that the origin of the disease was naïve.
The first known example of the new vaccine virus can be traced back to 1 December 2019, located in the north of China.
Within a month, the incidence of new vaccines in the northern part of Lake Lake has increased gradually.
The majority of these patients were associated with the distribution of the market in Vanuatu, while the market was also selling live animals, a theory that the new strain virus originated from some of them; or, in other words, that it originated from human diseases. On 26 December, a doctor in the Central and Western Hemisphere Hospital in the province of Lelewe found and recovered a number of lung patients who had unknown causes, and on 27 December to the Center for Disease Prevention in the outlying Area.
On December 30th, a group of doctors from the Hospital of the San Juan Center reminded their colleagues of a "serious virus like SARS".
Eight doctors, including Levin, were trained by the police for spreading the word of complaint, and another doctor, Effin, was trained by the Lahore alert.
The Health Committee of the City of Huang subsequently published a statement on 31 December and reported to the World Health Organization.
After receiving a number of reports of lung disease cases, a study was launched in early January. The number of cases was about seven and a half times daily at the early stage of the outbreak of the virus.
In early January to mid-May 2020, the virus was spread to other provinces of China.
On 20 January, China reported in one day about 140 cases of new infectious diseases, including 2 cases and 1 cases of tuberculosis.
The following official data show that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people have had symptoms. As of March 26, the United States is the largest country in China and Italy. As of 9 April 2020, the global cumulative report is more than 161,000 cases; death is over 9.7 million cases, healing over 36.4 million cases.
About 200 countries and regions around the world have reported cases of infectious diseases.

The food shipments were only temporary, and even in Afghanistan, Chinese government officials also released meat stocks to ensure adequate food for the population.
Italy has similar legal provisions, which require food producers to provide supplies for such emergencies.
Global economic losses have affected China: a media report on 16 March said that two months ago, two months ago, the impact of the measures taken by the Government, the economics of China were severely affected and the sales of 20.5% had been broken down.
As China's continent is the world's main economic and manufacturing centre, the spread of the virus has been considered to constitute a major threat to global economic stability.
According to Agathe Demarais of the "Economics" Intelligence Group, the market will remain unstable until there is a clearer knowledge of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of global economic growth could have on global growth could be greater than the non-individual epidemics in 2002-2004.
One expert at the University of St. Louis Washington estimates that the impact of vaccines on global supply chains will amount to $3,000, which may last for two years.
It was reported that, due to China's decline in demand, oil-exporting organizations (OPEC) were "hard to deal with after a substantial decline in oil prices".
On 24 February, COVID-19 cases outside the China continent increased significantly, leading to the fall of the global unit.
On 27 February, the public's concern about the incidence of new vaccines increased by 100 indicators, including Nasdak, and the number of categories of American units, including the PUL 500 and the average industrial index, from 2008 onwards, from 1,191 points to 1,191 points, to the largest daily decline since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
Three major indicators dropped by more than 10% during the week.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but remained negative.
The public's concern about the new type of symphony virus has been compounded by the destruction of the capital city on 16 March.
Most people believe that economic recession is a major factor.
Economicist Mohamed El-Erian claims that emergency measures have been taken on a timely basis in both central and state levels.
The central response was faster than the financial crisis in 2008.
The travel ban, the closure of public places such as the tourism point, and the recommendations of Governments to avoid the impact of tourism have become one of the most serious sectors affected.
As a result, many airlines have canceled their flights, including British airlines, Chinese Eastern airlines and Australian airlines, and British airlines Flybe are unfortunately closed.
The post industry has been re-created more than ever before.
Many railway stations and railway gates were also closed.
It was an important tourist season in China during the period during which vaccination was slow.
The national and local governments have abolished a series of activities involving groups of people, including a one-year holiday, and private enterprises have also closed their own shops and tourist sights, such as Hong Kong Dyssin Park and Upper Heidis Neem.
Many new annual activities and tourist sights, including the Beijing Festival and the Traditional Assembly, have been eliminated and closed to prevent large crowds from gathering.
In 31 provinces of China, 24 of the provinces of the direct cities and self-government have extended the new year's leave to 10 February, demanding that the majority of enterprises be not re-employed before that date.
The total domestic production in these areas is 80 per cent of the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong will increase the incidence of infectious diseases at the highest level and announce entry into emergency conditions, cease school until March, cancel the new year's holiday. The retail industry is affected globally, reduces time in the store or temporarily shut down.
The sales volume in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
The sales volume in North America and the Middle East region decreased by 50 to 60 per cent.
In addition, the incidence of vaccinated clients from the shopping centre for 3 months decreased by 33 to 43 per cent over 2 months.
Additional measures have been taken by operators from procurement centres around the world, such as increased sanitation facilities, the installation of heat scans to measure the body of buyers, and the elimination of certain activities. According to the estimates of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, large-scale economic declines may lead to a high population in Latin America more than $14 million to 2.2 million in the absence of large flows.
In January and February 2020, there were approximately 500,000 unemployed persons in China.
China has nearly 3 billion farmers, many of whom have been left in the province of the Netherlands or in the province of Leibe. In March 2020, more than 1,000,000 Americans are unemployed, and the government has applied for assistance.
According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the new strain vaccines may result in unemployment of 4,7 million people in the United States and unemployment rates may reach 32 per cent. India's blockades have resulted in millions (on a daily basis) unemployment of Indian farmers. Angsrid Institute survey found that 44 per cent of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment. Since the mid-March 2020 ban in Spain has been imposed, nearly 90,000 workers have been unemployed.
In the second half of March, 40 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment relief, and 1 million British workers applied for general benefit. Germany employed nearly 50 million companies in Germany to regulate the reduction of government subsidies.
France and Britain have also taken advantage of the reduction in Germany ' s working time.
The arts and cultural industries have also been re-introduced, and organizations in the global context have not been able to function successfully, as well as employees and individuals.
Arts and cultural industry organizations strive to maintain their mission (usually funded by the Government), to show the community cultural heritage, to protect the safety of its employees and the public, and to provide support to artists as far as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, museums and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed to different levels, original exhibitions, and events and performances had been forced to be cancelled or delayed.
In response to this situation, the parties began to provide alternative services through the digital platform, which will soon lead to many religious services, major sports activities and other social activities (e.g. music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and timing) and will increase rapidly.
The film industry was also under attack.
Many areas recommend that elderly Christians stay in their homes and do not have to attend Mass on Sundays; some churches celebrate their holidays on the Internet or on television, and some churches allow them to worship in their cars.
In the Roman Empire, its small church was closed, and other religious groups were also banned or restricted in the churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, and the Magi, or a limited public assembly.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced a five-week prayer for the elimination of the affected areas and for the closure of the Holy Land, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry into the Holy Land of Saints and their inhabitants into the Holy Land of Mecca and the Holy Land.
It has resulted in the greatest destruction since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or delayed, including the 2019-20 European Championships, the 2019-20 European Championships, the 2020 European Championships, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 World Cups.
This explosion broke out the Summer Olympics Plan, originally scheduled for the end of July 2020; the International Committee of the Regions announced on 24 March that the event would "reorganise after 2020, but not later than 2021."
As a result, many bloggers have turned to Web-based gambling, and many Web-based gambling websites have reported a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and various music groups have slowed down or cancelled the tournament.
A lot of large theaters, such as the Old Coliseum, have also been suspended.
Some artists have also tried to continue to create and share works through the Internet to replace traditional performances such as live live live live live live live live live live live live music or create a network "sect day" for artists to play, broadcast and advertise their works.
On the Internet, many of them have been broadcast through the new-type virus networks, and under uncertainty, many have begun to respond in a humorous and focused manner.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice against Chinese, East Asian and European peoples, the United States and other national hotspots has increased, and racial discrimination has increased.
In many countries and regions, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia, there have been fear, suspicion and hatred.
A number of reports of 2 months of this year (most of the cases still limited to China) recorded the racist feelings expressed by different groups around the world against Chinese people, and considered that Chinese people should be infected or treated with the so-called due compensation.
Some African countries have also experienced a rise in anti-war behaviour.
It has been reported that many people in the region of the Huang and the North Lake have been subjected to geographical discrimination.
Both on the line and on the line, there is a voice of support for Chinese people as well as residents in the region of serious vulnerability.
With the spread of the virus to other hot spots, Italy became the first European COVID-19 with a serious explosion, and people from the country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Korea have initially signed a petition asking that China be banned from entering their country in order to try to prevent the spread of disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeTo Japan (Chinese people come to Japan) has been broadcast widely on Twitter.
China and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported that racial abuse and attacks were increasing.
U.S. President Donald Tranpin has been criticized for calling the new vaccine "China virus", and critics believe that there is racial discrimination and anti-war behaviour.
Ukraine's protesters attacked public cars that had been launched from armaments to New Sandzari, including Ukrainian and foreign refugees.
It has been reported that students from the north-east of India (connected to China) and in the main cities of India have also been harassed by the outbreak of a new strain virus.
The Indian People's Party, Mr. Dilip Gosh, President of the West Bank, said that China has destroyed nature, "so God is going to punish them."
These statements were later condemned by China's response councils in the Galway, calling them "misleading". In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination among non-Chinans also increased because of the widespread flow, while foreigners were described as "foreign waste", should be the target of "waste treatment".
Many of the papers that have a payout wall have been partially or partially offset by reports of new types of vaccines.
A number of scientific publishers have published a number of scientific journals related to vaccines.
Some scientists have also chosen to quickly share their findings on the print server, such as bioRxiv.

2019 The laboratory methods of testing for sarcoidosis (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include: testing whether the virus exists and whether antibodies occur after the infection.
RT-PCR is capable of testing the RNA virus and thus determining whether there is a virus in the sample.
This test is specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine whether recent infections have been infected or active infections.
Anti-inflammatory testing (blood clearance test) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Anti-psychotic tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those who are slow and have no reports or symptoms.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease, as well as the level of immunization among the population.
Due to the limited number of inspections, as at March 2020, no country/area could provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As at 23 March, no national/regional inspectors exceeded 3 per cent of their population, and the number of inspections completed in each country/area was huge.
This variance may also have a serious impact on the mortality rate in some countries.
A verifiable result is achieved only within the first week of the infection.
In general, a few hours to 2 days can be achieved.
The RT-PCR test carried out with the vaccine only completes within the first week of the infection.
Then the virus disappears in the lungs, but it continues to reproduce in the lungs.
For those who have been tested for the second week following infection, samples may be replaced by a deep respiratory tract extract obtained through the use of the spleen or may be used for the use of spleen (petroleum).
In January 2020, RRT-PCR was published at the hospital in Berlin (Charité), one of the early PCR testing laws, and became the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the UK also issued a test law. On 28 January 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a secondary level based on PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 Test Box (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to have access to SARS-CoV-2 of the National Medicines Supervisory Authority in China to verify the rapid use of the vaccines produced by PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed a new vaccine to the public health laboratory (19-nCoV) in 2019.
An early version of the test kit was used by three gene testing laws, one of which led to the failure of the test product, while at the same time a test bottle appeared in the Atlantic CDC, resulting in a total of less than 100 average samples of successful daily treatment in February 2020.
The two parts of the test law were confirmed to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and the State and the local laboratory were allowed to begin the investigation.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food Drug Control Authority on the basis of urgent use authorization.
LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR can be carried out from 5 March 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced a national-wide COVID-19 test from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been declared; sample collection and processing must be implemented in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 The testing is carried out by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Viruses and Biological Technology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered at the Russian Federation Health Supervisory Board. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that MEO developed a test box for COVID-19 infection. A test method for Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA on 13 March 2020, which could complete large quantities of tests within 3.5 hours so that a device could be performed within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of Abbott's m2000 system; FDA had previously issued similar authorisations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, a test method for Cepedhed was also authorized to use FDA as soon as possible for approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test method for the use of a heat-increasing technology, such as the use of nuclear acid, in place of PCR.
Since this method does not require a range of rotational rotations, only 5 minutes can result in sunlight and 13 minutes can determine the result.
The United States currently has about 18,000 such devices, and it is expected that Abbott will increase production in order to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a method of testing for the use of monoclonal antibodies (specially associated with new-type anti-emergency vaccines (N-problems) and hopes that it will be able to provide the test results within 15 to 20 minutes as fast-frequency testing.
A report in March 2020 summarized this conclusion: "In the early stages of the virus, breast surgery is very low, and CT [computer scan] is likely to show clearly, even before the symptoms occur."
The typical characteristics of CT include double-square glass film, which has a non-smoker and rear-buffer week.
As the disease progresses, there will be a marked decline in bone density, stone cuts and dust changes.
A study of PCR and CT (the first place of the outbreak of the major epidemic) showed that CT sensitivity is much higher than PCR, but CT's accuracy is much lower, and many of its image-based educational characteristics are worse with other diseases and diseases.
As of March 2020, the U.S. Radio Institute recommended "CT should not be used to test COVID-19 or to test COVID-19 as a single test tool." Since March 2020, CDC recommended using PCR to conduct initial testing.
Part of the immune response to infection is the result of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used for individual infections around 7 days after the start of the test condition, to determine the immunization of the infected population. The analysis can be carried out in the central laboratory (CLT) or via immediate testing (PoCT).
Many of the high-end automatic systems in bed labs are able to carry out the above analysis, but their availability depends on the production rate of the systems.
In the case of CLT, although it can follow the immunization response through a series of samples, it usually uses an external blood sample.
In the case of PoCT, a blood sample will be used in general.
Prior to the analysis, no step-by-step implementation is required, which is different from the PCR method. On 26 March 2020, the FDA approved a test method for 29 entities' claims, which are now able to distribute its anti-containing test kit.
As at 7 April 2020, FDA has approved only one test, based on the authorisation of urgent use. As of March 2020, the Omone Medical Experimental Investigations Company and Epitope Diagnostics have been approved in Europe, which can target HIV testing in blood samples.
Hundreds of samples can be tested within hours and therefore much faster than traditional PCRs.
In general, the 14 days after the infection began can be investigated. In early April, the British discovered that it was not available in the sample box that it was purchased.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspects that might be able to reside in the hospital, "improve the patient's emergency room," to test the patient into the test, and then send the test back and eventually results. The British NHS announced that it will take appropriate preventive measures to eliminate the risk of infection of others when it comes to the hospital, and that patients should be at risk of infection with the help car after the use of a rescue vehicle. In case of a similar case, medical professionals can take appropriate preventive measures to take.
In Germany, the National Institute for Legal Health Insurance, on 2 March, has helped Korea to conduct more extensive tests than other countries, indicating that the non-resident agencies have been able to carry out approximately 12,000 tests every day, and 10,700 have been tested in the past week.
The costs are borne by health insurance if the doctor requests it.
The head of Robert Koch Institute, Germany, stated that Germany's overall audit capacity is 160,000 per week.
As at 19 March, a free-vehicle inspection has been carried out in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of investigators conducted in Germany was not known, as only the number of persons reported to have been pollinated.
An initial laboratory survey showed that as at 12 weeks of 2020, at least one sample of 483,295 (including 12 weeks of 2020) was tested, 33,491 samples (6.9%) SARS-CoV-2 solarity. In Israel, Technion and Rambam hospitals, researchers developed and tested a method used to test 64 patients ’ samples, i.e. total samples, and only in combined samples were found to be solar. In the meantime, a 2000-performance test laboratory named "Fire" (BGI) was established in Washington, U.S.A.A.A.A., on 5 February 2020, and was able to handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built 5 days under the supervision of the Wallagen-generic generators, and the construction showed that, if the above-mentioned inspection capacity had not been achieved, the disease in the north would rise by 47 per cent and the related costs of separation would also be repeated.
After the heavy-duty lab, Saizin, Beijing and the upper sea immediately built a fire lab, and China now has 12 cities with it.
By March 4, 2020, the total number of laboratory testing days is 50,000 per day. Origami Assays is open and multi-way design is available only for COVID19 samples of more than 1122 patients. These balanced designs can be operated in small laboratorys without the need for automatic fluids.
As of March, the lack of test drugs and the lack of numbers have become obstacles to large-scale testing in the EU and in Britain and the United States.
This led to a number of sample preparation programmes that involved increasing the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) up to 5 minutes to release the RNA gene group. The United Arab Emirates announced on 31 March that a new vaccine test has now been carried out for more of its population, more than any other country, and a large number of inspectors are expanding their inspection levels in order to allow large populations to accept it.
The means to achieve this inspection capacity is to use the driving-through test on the one hand, and to fund the Group 42 and the Great Gene (based on its "Fire Eye" Emergency Test Laboratory in China) to create a high-quality laboratory to respond to the needs of large-scale people.
The laboratory was built within 14 days, and thousands of RT-PCR tests could be carried out every day, the first large laboratory operating abroad in China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different methods of testing for various components of the vaccine gene.
The World Health Organization adopted a method for the German production test kit to send samples to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own sample boxes.
Germany's approach was published on 17 January 2020; the programmes developed by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention could be used on 28 January, thus limiting the ability to monitor the United States. China and the United States faced the issue of the reliability of the test boxes at an early stage, which could not provide sufficient testing boxes to meet the needs and health experts.
On the contrary, the experts believe that the widespread testing of Korea has helped to reduce the spread of new strain virus.
The Government of Korea is benefiting from the inspection capacity created in the past few years, which is mainly concentrated in the private sector laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programmes as the best way to reduce the development of COVID-19 epidemics. The widespread spread of viruses led to a very high demand for testing, resulting in the blockage of tens of thousands of tests by the U.S. private laboratory, and the supply of vaccines and chemicals also became tense.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kit.
In the United States, the CPC test box had "miss"; the government then eliminated official anti-biological barriers to the testing of the private laboratory. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company and bought it from a Chinese biotechnology limited company and found the results incorrect.
The company explained that the results of the test could not be correctly collected as a result of incorrect collection of samples or misuse of the test product.
The Governor of Spain indicated that the return of the result of the error would be returned and replaced by another test box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic had 80 per cent of the test results obtained from China. Slovakia had purchased 120 000 test boxes from China and found it inappropriate.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that these test boxes should be thrown into the river. Atesh Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's search box "high rate" was bought from China and did not "appropriate them into use".
There is positive effect on the identification and follow-up of SARS-CoV-2.
Researchers working in the city of Vo in Italy (COVID-19, Italy’s first case of the death of patients) conducted two rounds of checks on the total population of 3,400 people, each for about 10 days.
About half of these people were diagnosed with sunlight and no symptoms, and all cases found were isolated.
The introduction of restrictions on communities has completely eliminated new infections.
Through large-scale follow-up stakeholders, restrictions on entry travel, testing and segregation were imposed on the spread of witness virus in Singapore far away from other developed countries/areas, and Singapore did not take extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and malls.
Singapore cancelled a number of activities, starting on 28 March, recommending that residents stay at home, but the school resumes the course after the holiday period on 23 March.
Several other countries/areas, such as Ireland and Korea, have also limited access to access, testing and segregation, as well as unaccompanied blockage measures to control the spread of disease.
A statistical study found that compared to the number of deaths, the number of countries tested more and the rate of deaths was also lower, as these countries might be better able to monitor only groups with mild or non-sympathetic symptoms.
WHO recommends that no inspection capacity and that country-level laboratories deal with COVID-19 countries with limited experience and send their previous five-lighted and 10-performance COVID-19 samples to 16 WHOs compared to one of the laboratories.
In this 16 reference laboratory, 7 of which are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America, 1 are in Australia.
In the following charts, the impact of "inspective %" is included in the national testing policies.
In the same circumstances as in other circumstances, only countries that have tested all citizens (whether or not they appear to be ill), their solar inspection rate is higher than those that have been tested.
Washing hands, also called hand cleaning, is done to clean the hands of bones, fats, microorganisms or other useless substances.
In certain "critical times" of the day, persistent breast-feeding can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as hunger and confusion, which can be spread through mouth and mouth.
If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses or mouth (i.e. sore throats), they may also be infected with respiratory system disease, such as flu or common sense.
In one day, the job must take five key hours to wash the dry hands: after removal, after cleaning the child’s breast or after changing the bottle, before eating, before eating, and after handling or after treatment of meat, fish or meat.
The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following cases:
Before and after food is prepared.
I'll take care of the patient.
Replaced or cleaned after the child's breast-feeding.
Sneaking, sneezing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food or animal skins.
The medical personnel manual refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
The spread of disease can be prevented or minimised before medical care is initiated or performed.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to wash the hands of the diseases that may harm the human body or cause the disease (cyctomy, virus or other microorganisms that cause the disease) and chemicals.
Washing hands is particularly important for those involved in the processing of food or in the field of medical care, but washing hands is also a very important practice for the public.
(b) Many benefits of hand washing for health, including minimization of fluids, viral virus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious diseases; and reduction of respiratory system infections;
And the infant mortality rate is reduced when it comes to home.
One study in 2013 showed that improved washing habits had a small role in increasing the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, a reduction in the mortality rate of children related to respiratory systems and respiratory diseases can be achieved by promoting simple changes in behaviour (e.g. by washing hands).
This simple act may reduce the mortality rate of the above disease by nearly 50 per cent.
This method of advocacy can reduce the occurrence of approximately one third of the greenhouse gas emissions, which is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
The most effective and cost-effective method of preventing acute respiratory infections (ARI) as a family, schools and communities around the world, can be reduced by a 48 per cent reduction in diarrhea.
As a major emergency respiratory infection, it is the primary cause of the death of children under five years of age, and it will take about 180 million children every year.
The death of nearly 350,000 children each year by hunger and diarrhea.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund stated that, compared with any single vaccination or medical intervention, food and after-treatment habits could save more lives, which could reduce the mortality of the hungry and reduce almost half the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
As part of the water supply, environmental and personal health (WASH) project, other health interventions will usually be taken while promoting washing hands.
Washers can also prevent lung diseases that are transmitted through direct contact with the body.
Washing hands can have a slight adverse effect, which often leads to skin damage.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive washing hands would lead to skin rash and rupture, known as hand dry or hand skin, which is particularly common among medical staff.
One of the most common symptoms of OCD is that of excessive fatigue.
In order to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, one day it will be necessary to use five key hours of dry hands: after breast-feeding (e.g. breast-feeding and breast-feeding), after breast-feeding (change of breast-feeding) for children, before meals, before and after meals, or after treatment of meat, fish or meat.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, the right washing hands should also be used in the following circumstances: after the treatment of cuts or injuries, after the injection, after the swelling, or after the swelling of the nose, after the touch of the animal or after treatment of the animal; and after contact with the waste.
In many countries/areas, the percentage of bathing hands is very low.
In 2015 a study of 54 countries' wash hands found that an average household of 38.7% used dry hands. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia's highest rate reached 97%; the United States was close to average, i.e. 77%; China's lowest rate was 23%.
The " Basic Health Health Plan" of the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is a model of a massive initiative to promote children ' s health and education.
The National Plan is the core of the year ' s democracies, accompanied by daily washing hands and toothbrushes.
In Indonesia, the plan has also been successful.
Integrate in the water into fats or cleaners, it is better to clean the microorganisms on the skin.
The primary role of fatty acids and cleaning products is to reduce depletion barriers and to increase vulnerability.
Only water cannot be used effectively to clean the skin, as fat and protein (a component of organic soil) are not readily released from water.
But clean hands need reasonable water...
Steady fats may be stored as a result of re-use, which may be stored prior to use.
A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacterium from contaminated solid fats to the conclusion that phytosanitary cannot be transferred, as bacterium will be washed away from contaminated fat.
But CDC still claims to be "the best use of non-interactive fluids".
The immune system has been highly promoted in the public with a healthy conscience.
To date, no evidence has shown that the use of promiscuous antibiotics or pesticides has chosen antibiotics in the natural environment.
However, antimicrobials contain antibiotics such as common trichlorosate, and trichlorosate has a large amount of microbiological phytosanitary.
Therefore, even if it is not effective to choose antimicrobials for antibiotics, antibodies may not be as effective as they are.
In addition to face-to-face active substances and protective agents, complex combinations may also include acids such as pH-value adjustment agents (petroleum, anti-hypertensive acid, acidic acid), anti-coagulants (petroleum, vitamins, phosphoride, plant fats). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Ohio's Public Health Institute of Medicine shows that in relation to the prevention of diseases and elimination of hand disease, general antipsychotic effects are similar to those of polychlorosate-containing antibiotics.
Hot water washers are comfortable, but their temperature is not enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria are in the body temperature (37 °C) very fast.
However, it is more effective in cleaning natural fats containing soil and phytosanitary oils than cold water.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of hot water has no effect on the reduction of microorganisms in hand, in contrast to the general view.
The treatment of water or pesticide washers belongs to non-water-based cleaning agents.
In the late 1990s and early 20th century, non-water-based alcohol-free products (also called alcohol-free, non-water-free or wash-free) were widely welcomed.
Most of the components of these wash hands contain adhesion or adhesion, as well as the addition of adhesion or adhesion, such as carbom (aqueous acid combination), or the addition of arable fluid, or aqueous form, to facilitate use and reduce the use of adhesion caused by alcohol.
In addition to explanation, excess oxygen can increase the immune activity. At least 60% to 95% of alcohol-free washers can be effective.
Alcoholic acid can kill bacteria, multi-drug pharmacology (MRSA) and anticoagulants (VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, urea, RSV), nephrosis, ovaries, fluids and fungi) and fungi.
After 30 seconds of use of 70% of alcohol-stimulating alcohol, 99.97% of the bacterium can be killed (reducing 3.5 levels, similar to 35 divisions), and one minute reducing by 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 levels). It is not the most effective treatment of the bacterium, but it has little effect on some viruses.
A virus such as norovirus (Norwalk) (the most common cause of infectious tuberculosis) is almost completely ineffective. It must be used to wash your hands thoroughly or cover your hands.
Wash your hands and your hands and your fingers and all the ends of your hands for about 30 seconds until the fluids, bubbles or bubbles change.
The needles must also be thoroughly washed and washed on both sides. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends better wash hands rather than use free wash hands, especially when they appear to be hard.
Because of the easy use and rapid loss of microorganisms, such fluids are increasingly used; however, they should not be replaced with correct washing hands unless they are free from moisture and water available.
Frequent use of alcohol-free washbasins will lead to skin ulcers, unless added to the mixture.
Can be added to the mixture to reduce or eliminate depletion caused by alcohol.
In a bed experience, there is a marked reduction in skin stimulants and skin cancer compared to fatty acids or anti-apocalyptic agents.
Hypersensitivity to skin cancer is rare in the context of the combination of cirrhosis of cirrhosis, or the addition of cirrhosis in the blood of alcohol or alcohol.
It is one of the reasons for its attractiveness that is lower than the possibility of the removal of the depletion of the perspiration of the perspiration of the perspiration of the perspiratory fluid.
The lack of clean water is effective, but it is not possible to remove organic matter from the hands, but only to eliminate it.
Therefore, the prevention of the spread of many diseases may not be as bad as cold and water, since they are still in the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic washers depends to a large extent on the components and components, and their effects are far different from those of alcohol and alcohol.
In recent times, the combination of the use of chlorofluorocarbons has been confirmed to have sustained and cumulative anti-metic activity, in contrast to alcohol, which has been confirmed to reduce the effects of re-use, possibly due to a gradual adverse skin reaction.
Many people in low-income communities do not have a heavy burden and can be used for wood or landfills.
It's good to wash the hands of a tree or a tub, but it's not fat.
One of the problems was that if soil or wood was contaminated by microorganisms, it could accelerate the spread of disease rather than slowing it down.
Like fat, wood dust is also a toxic agent, because it creates a toxic fluid after it has been in contact with water.
WHO suggests that if no fat is available, it can be replaced with wood or sand instead of fat.
The correct steps recommended by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease spread are as follows:
Get your hands dirty with liquid hot water or steam.
The recommended use of water is due to the possibility of contamination of the plant and the temperature of the water appears to be relatively low.
Use a large amount of fat to resuscitate dust to produce dust, while cleaning hands, fingers and fingernails.
Fatty acids can be removed from the skin, and studies have shown that people are more likely to wash their hands thoroughly when they use fat instead of individual water.
At least 20 seconds to wash.
Washing can produce mollusc energy, which helps to remove the bacteria on the skin, to wash longer and to remove the bacteria more.
Wash well with running water.
The water wash can be recontamination.
A clean hair dryer or a natural dryer.
Hand mills are easier to re-infect. Hand mills, handbags, handbags, and fingerprints are the most often neglected parts.
Handicrafts and cut-offs may store microorganisms.
It is usually recommended that breast milk be used to avoid tooth decay in the hands; skin cancer can cause skin damage and thus increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries, where water and/or moisture are not available, low-cost measures can be made available to wash hands, such as through a thick or thick drop in water, as well as/or the use of wood dryers (if necessary). In the case of limited water supply (e.g. schools in developing countries or rural areas), water washers can be used, for example, in a simple manner and other low-cost manner.
The simple water chain technology is easy to handle with a glass of water, and then a small amount of water falls into the hands and is used again.
The effective cleaning of the hands is an important step in the health process of the hands, but there are still some disputes about the most effective means of the public health.
More and more studies have shown that the paper is more healthy than many health-care mobile phones.
In 2008, the University of London, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, which compared the level of health with the number of paper, hot-rolled wires and more modern explosives.
After washing hands with hot windscreens, both hands were found to increase by 194 per cent, and 254 per cent were to increase by average.
The average increase in the total number of cells is 42 per cent, and the mean increase in the total number of cells is 15 per cent.
After hand washing, the total amount of bacteria on hand is reduced by 76 per cent, and the total concentration of bacterium is reduced by 77 per cent. Scientists have also carried out tests to determine whether various methods of manipulating may result in inter-health users and inter-health facilities.
It is commonly reported that the radio spectrum is 180 metres/second (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) and that it is possible to explode into hand and body microorganisms, thus destroying other inter-health users and inter-health facilities within 2 metres.
The use of hot-rolled mobile phones can transmit microbiotics to areas more than 0.25 meters outside the cell.
A study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt in 2005 showed that no serious microbiology would occur.
The following changes were observed after the amputation:
The study involved many different cell manufacturers and compared these cell phones with the paper user.
During the journey, it is possible to choose to use hand washing hands in case there is no moisture and water.
At least 60 per cent of the amount of alcohol-free washed hands should be used.
In 1846, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, found a disease capable of effectively preventing the spread of the disease in the hospital, but after a long time, it was forced to require medical personnel to perform it.
The hospital uses electronic equipment that can be used to provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that the use of these equipment had reduced the rate of infection.
Medical personnel must continue to wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or soap when washing their hands in order to produce dust and wash hands.
Both hands are intertwined with each other.
If there is a defect between the needles, it can be cleared with a hard brush.
Since the remaining water is likely to remain a cyclical, it is necessary to wash thoroughly and with clean hair dryers.
After drying, close the water hole with the paper (open the door when necessary).
This can prevent the re-contamination of the hands because of contact with these faces.
In health institutions, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate microorganisms (“symbolic”) and to avoid spread.
The New England Medical magazine reports that in most medical environments, there is still an unacceptable level of hand washing, and a large number of medical personnel have often forgotten hand washing before contacting patients, leading to microbiology.
One study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures could lead to a 66 per cent reduction in the rate of blood flow. The World Health Organization has published a working schedule and has modelled the standard washing of hands and hands.
The organization has also published a draft manual on the Health Manual of the Department on its website for public opinion.
Whitby et al.
If there is a need to confirm the regulatory nature of the legislation, commercial equipment can measure and verify the health of the manual.
The World Health Organization recommended "five hours" of washing hands:
After contact with blood/body fluids
Before the surgery is performed, and
After care for patients, adding antimicrobials to the fats ("medicine") or "antimetics") can cause the mucous membranes to cause the bacterium to act as a killer.
In a pre-operative or large-scale anti-inflammatory microbiological environment, such an operation may need to be performed. When both "clean" hands are needed for surgery, there must be no contact with the open and closed water pipes, which contain chlorophylls or salts, which are used to wash the hands of the hands, and other non-smokers that are used to wash the hands of the unsaturated bone marrow, and the cleaning of clean hands.
All heads are going down.
This process requires washing hands, before the front door to the front door, usually for 2-6 minutes.
You don't need to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
The water on the front wall must be prevented from flowing into the hands when the shower is rescinded.
After washing your hands, use a non-alcoholic washer and wear surgery clothes.
In order to reduce the spread of bacterium, it is best to wash hands before contacting patients or to use free washers.
In order to control the pathological infection in the hospital, further benefits were found to be very limited when the main benefits of the clean hands ranged from 20 per cent to more than 35 per cent when the clean hands were increased to 35 per cent.
In comparison with the use of antimicrobials, the use of conventional antipsychotics has resulted in the spread of more than three times as many infectious diseases on the food. After comparison with antipsychotics, 26 per cent of the use of antipsychotic enzymes has been observed after comparison with the use of antipsychotics (average 30 seconds) as compared with the use of antipsychotics.
However, for H1N1 influenza (HI1N1 influenza A) Clostridium difficult traceres, fatty acids and water-sustainment hormones are more effective. The provision of alcohol-stimulating agents and intervention measures, such as written and oral reminders of workers, can improve the health of the health of the medical institution.
Further research is needed for the most effective interventions in the medical environment.
In developing countries, breast-feeding is considered a cost-effective tool for accessing physical health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, sanitation or washing equipment in schools and workplaces has made it a challenge for people to wash their hands in public.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there is a cheap method to build a washing machine, there is still very little evidence of the safeness of the washing of hands near each private health centre or public health centre.
However, the low washing rate may also be a deep-rooted practice, not because of lack of moisture or water.
Promoting and promoting the use of washing hands can affect policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands and lead to changes in the long-term behaviour of citizens.
To do so effectively, monitoring and evaluation must be carried out.
Through a systematic evaluation of 70 studies, it was found that, in the percentage of low-income countries (LMICs), a community-based approach was more effective than a community-based method of marketing activities. One example of the school-led "three-star approach" offered by the United Nations Children's Fund, with the exception of other health requirements, encouraged schools to take simple and easy measures to ensure that students are used to wash their hands.
When reaching the minimum standard, schools can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Washing can include building a washroom to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of the promotion of hand washing activity is the World Washing Day, which aims to try to achieve changes in behavior.
Few studies have been studied in developing countries and the overall cost-effectiveness of washing hands has been achieved and the relationship between DALY.
However, it was reported that the cost benefits of promoting the use of well-cleaning hands were more significant compared to other water and sanitation interventions.
The first recognized the importance of hand washing for human health — especially for those who are physically weak (e.g. those who have just produced mothers or wounded soldiers in the hospital) is the first two health-related people in the middle of the 19th century: Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis) and the British "modern nurse " Florence Nightingale".
At that time, most people still consider the infection to be the cause of the so-called toxic substance.
The outbreak of foodborne diseases and medical infections in the 18th century, led to the increased active promotion of the health of the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, stressing that the health of the Department is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine fever in 2009 and the COVID-19 in 2020, which has made many countries more aware of the importance of breast-feeding in order to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, Germany will cover the "correct method of washing" at the front of the office building, as well as at the airport.
The phrase "no washing" means that a person does not want to take responsibility for something or to participate in something.
It came from the contents of the Bible "The Gospel of Matthew, the Pontius Pilate (Pontius Pilate) who decided to lay hands on Jesus after his death, and later became widely used in a number of English-speaking groups.
In "Michael" in Zambia, Mrs. McBecklea began to be forced to wash out the point of attempting to clean up the idea, indicating that she felt guilty of the crimes committed by her own husband and wife.
Studies show that people who think or imagine immoral acts often wash hands more often than others and that they often appreciate tools.
In addition, it is unlikely that those who can wash their hands after thinking of immoral acts, for example, would be able to perform other "cleaning" actions, such as volunteer work.
Religion comes from health and iconic purposes. The use of water and non-fatal symbolic washing hands when washing hands is part of many religious symbols, including Bahaï, India, Jewish baths (tevilah) and ritual baths (netilat yadayim) and Christian baths and the small washing of the hands in Islam. Religion also has health regulations, especially after certain acts.
Indians, Jews and Islam require washing hands as well.
India, Fascism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require the use of hands after meals.
COVID-19 Prevention of the workplace
COVID-19 The workplace is controlled by occupational safety and health prevention measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in 2019 (COVID-19).
Whether risk protection at work is adequately dependent on specific workplaces and tasks and risk assessments based on exposed sources should be determined by the severity of community disease and the risk factors that may be associated with COVID-19 infection.
At the request of the United States Employment Safety and Health Authority (OSHA), the minimum exposure to risks to public and other employees is recommended, and it is therefore recommended that basic measures be taken to prevent infection, including occupational washers, encourage the separation of workers from post-patient home, follow respiratory procedures and daily cleaning and disposal of work environments.
Secondary exposure to risks includes the need for regular or close contact with patients who do not know or suspect the work of COVID-19, which may lead to infection due to sustained community dissemination or international travel.
These include contact with general public staff, such as schools, high-end working environments and some large retailing environments.
In addition to basic vaccination prevention measures, the group should also use air-conditioning equipment for high-efficiency air-conditioning and evaporation protection devices, including personal protective equipment and other risk control measures in contact with COVID-19 patients.
OSHA believes that there is a high exposure risk for patients who have known or suspected COVID-19 medical personnel and cell staff who are aware of or suspect that COVID-19 patients have been exposed to or from whom they have been exposed have been exposed to or from whom they have been exposed.
Hazardous protective measures applied to such persons include engineering control, such as personal protective equipment that is subject to the pressure of the windscreen and that is suitable for its tasks.
COVID-19 explosions may have a serious impact on the workplace.
Staff members may need to take care of others or fear that they are exposed to illness.
Business models may also change, including changes in commodity requirements, or changes in access to these goods (such as purchases during a non-higher period, or use delivery or transportation services).
Finally, products from the severe areas of the COVID-19 may be cut off.
These plans address the level of risk associated with various workplaces and mandates, including exposure, risk factors from the family and community environment and risk factors of individual workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
These plans also outline measures to address these risks, as well as emergency response plans for potential outbreaks.
The prevention and response plan may need to be followed by national or local recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak of vaccines include reducing the spread of workers, protecting the health and risk of people at higher risk of ill-health and disease, maintaining operational operations, and minimizing the adverse effects of other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, response measures will also be affected by the serious impact of community disease on businesses.
The level of risk protection is a widely used protection framework for occupational safety and health, which is used in order to integrate risk control measures in a manner that is effective.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, administrative control, and personal protective equipment.
Engineering control means that staff are separated from the risks involved, rather than controlling the behaviour of workers, which is also the least cost-effective solution programme.
Administrative control refers to changing work policies or procedures and requires staff member or employer to take action on their own.
The protection effects of personal protective equipment (PPPE) are lower than engineering control and administrative control, but help to prevent some explosions.
All types of PPE need to be selected according to the level of risk faced by staff, in accordance with applicable equipment (such as respiratory equipment), and must always be accurately monitored and maintained, changed when necessary, and properly disposed of, clean, stored or treated in order to avoid contamination.
In accordance with the provisions of the United States Employment Safety and Health Authority (OSHA), the minimum level of exposure to the work of public and other employees in the profession is revealed.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic measures to prevent infection, including occupational washers, recommend that patients be separated from their homes, follow respiratory procedures when they are vomiting or sneezing, provide paper and garbage, prepare a distance office, go to work when necessary, prevent workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintain daily cleaning and disposal at their workplace.
The timely identification and separation of potentially transmissible individuals are key to the protection of staff, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that workers who show emergency respiratory symptoms should be separated from their homes for at least 24 hours until they are determined not to have heat, temperature and any other condition, that they should be implemented in a flexible manner, allow workers to care for their families and be informed of that policy.
According to OSHA, the average exposure risk work includes frequent or close contact with COVID-19 patients within 6 metres (1.8 m) but may lead to the spread of SARS-COV-2 in the area of infection, which is likely to occur near the workplace.
Such staff include schools, high population density work environments, and a number of high-risk public sales. The most recent engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of high-risk air carriers, improved air-conditioning, the installation physical barriers and the provision of customer services to the rear of vehicles. The administration of this group and high-risk groups includes encouraging the separation of the patient's homes, the creation of a false communication alternative to the false movement, the removal of unneeded travel to COVID-19, the development of emergency communications plans, including response to staff issues, the provision of personnel on risk factors and protection practices, the need for the use of protective equipment, the provision of protective and protective equipment, the provision of protective equipment, the provision of protective equipment, the provision of tools and equipment, the provision of tools and tools for the use of personnel, and equipment, including tools for emergency equipment, equipment and equipment, equipments and equipments for emergency services, and equipment, and equipments for emergency services, and equipment, and equipment, and equipment for emergency services, and services, and equipment, and equipments.
Such staff should be better equipped with respiratory equipment.
If a person is ill on the aircraft, it is appropriate to take protective measures to protect staff and other passengers, including the arrangement of patients to a distance of 6 km from other passengers, to designate a group of persons to serve the patient, to provide oral care to the patient, or to require the patient to stop using paper or paper in the drying or drying process.
In the case of patients who are sick, affected by contact with body fluids or potential contamination, group members should wear one medical gloves. If the patient is exposed to fever, persistent skeletal or respiratory problems, the group should also wear additional personal protective equipment.
Handbags and other sexual items should be treated in biological hazard bags and then treated with clean and toxic surfaces of contaminated surfaces. Risk control measures also include delays in travel during illness. If fever or other symptoms occur on the ship, self-resistance and immediate notification of the medical room on the ship should be made.
Medical visits should be carried out in a separate room. For schools and child care centres, the disease prevention centre recommends that if the infected are present in the school, the communities should be closed for a short period of time, in accordance with school and child care facilities, and be fully clean or disinfected.
For low-level communities, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as de facto examinations, meetings and sports courses, other major gatherings, such as singing or self-help services, increased distance between office tables, missed places and departures, restricted visits to non-required visitors, and separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
In addition to the implementation of social-displacement strategies, it is possible to consider extending the period of school leave. For law enforcement personnel implementing regular day-to-day activities, the Centre for Disease Prevention considers that they are at a lower risk of direct health.
It is recommended that COVID-19 be contacted if patients or law enforcement personnel who appear to be suspects are required to provide adequate personal protective equipment at the same level as emergency medical professionals.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, staff members shall be allowed to carry out cleaning and disinfection of their service belts and equipment and then be allowed to use the household after cleaning or excretion, and shall comply with standard personal protective equipment coverings and disposal procedures as well as clothing coverings and cleaning procedures.
OSHA believes that some medical and dental staff are at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-explosive risk staff include actual contact known or suspected health care of the infected COVID-19, support, laboratory and medical transport staff.
If staff members are exposed to a high risk of conducting or collecting or treating signs of infection or suspects of COVID-19 who have been known or suspected of being infected, they are at a high risk.
Aerodrome production process includes injecting, evaporating, evaporating, pneumatic inspection, some dental procedures and tests, or body samples.
High-risk space staff include personnel involved in the mass of dead bodies, who are treated with cures or similar diseases prior to their deaths; if they are implemented, they are more likely to be exposed. The engineering measures taken in addition to the needs of this risk group include a separate room prepared for COVID-19, or similar cases, including in the implementation of flight generation procedures.
Some health facilities and terminals can also be equipped with special air pressure systems.
Prevention measures at level 3 of biological safety should be taken at this stage.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that the patient be subject to a similar case of COVID-19 and assign different waiting zones for the patient. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Department of Professional Safety and Health recommends that respiratorys be provided to persons who have been known or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to those who have been working within 6 ng-range and implementing the flight generation process.
The United States requires that, in the context of health testing, training and medical examination, in the context of a comprehensive text-based respiratory protection plan, such as N95, which is approved by NIOSH, be used to overcome or improve bone marrow.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide better protection and enhance the well-being of staff. WHO does not promote the use of protective clothing, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not through the distribution of body fluids.
WHO's recommend that the access point check-in should only be covered with the outer ear of the medical department.
Regarding the need to collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services for patients, WHO recommends that staff who do not have to carry out a flight generation procedure should use medical outer cartons, glasses or syringes, long sleeves and gloves.
In order to implement the process of irradiation, it is necessary to replace the medical outer section with N95 or FFP2.
In view of the insufficient provision of global personal protective equipment, WHO recommends that physical barriers such as remote medical and transparent windows be allowed only by direct caregivers to access the COVID-19 patient rooms, that the use of the same respiratory equipment should be used only when specific tasks are really necessary, and that the same measures should be used to reduce the need for personal protective equipment in the case of the same patient in the case of multiple examinations, monitoring and coordination of personal protective equipment supply chains and non-smokering agents.

Since this month, we've faced some difficult situations.
In the face of COVID-19 vaccines, we clearly felt the relief of all humanity, while recognizing our responsibility for each other.
We are facing unprecedented challenges, but we are fully aware that the best measures to address these challenges need to be felt by people all over the world, to cooperate closely and to promote community-building, which is the core concept of Wikimedia.
Through e-mails, calls and chats, the communication of friendship and affection between all of our colleagues has proved quite well to the various aspects of our colleagues and how happy we are to work with each other.
I feel no more grateful and proud to be with you people.
Last week, someone expressed appreciation for our work.
They made me realize that the entire world could now use Wikipedia, which is a very significant thing, while I realize that this key resource maintains the strength of normal functioning of the symbolism that has brought to people around the world.
Whether your work is responsible for the operation of the web site, pay or community security, the normal operation of Wikimedia is not done by everyone.
The world below needs more information from Wikipedia than ever before.
At this stage, the content of our work and the way of work will have an important impact on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and the resurgence of our colleagues, we will begin to make some important adjustments to our methods of cooperation from next week.
Methods of work and timetable adjustment
As pointed out earlier, last night, the Superintendent Group held discussions on the working methods and schedules of the company for the next few days and months.
At the meeting, we took into account the appropriate responses we considered to the current challenges facing the company, as well as the best practices to ensure that the company maintains sustainable development during the vaccination process.
The competent team agreed to reduce the pressure of its employees so that all could support the company ' s mission for a long time.
We support you with a proper reduction of work pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working time will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week), followed by a different notification if there is change.
This adjustment is not temporary. If you are able to work longer each day, we will assign tasks to you according to your working hours.
However, given that the present world situation is unpredictable, we will give priority to caring for your personal needs, such as caring for family, getting out of business or looking after sickness.
We're not following your work time.
If you're sick, leave the job.
But we still want to remind you, please be careful.
You do not need to ask for sick leave or pay leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team to change their working schedule and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19th-century, please inform Brian of the cultural operation sector that the sector will provide support to you and ensure that your situation is properly managed.)
We will pay full wages for time employees.
We have already demonstrated and once again committed to observe the commitments made to contractors and working hours.
The remuneration we pay to all will continue to be calculated in accordance with the remuneration received during normal working hours.
Even if you're sick or unable to work.
If you're willing to work, we'll provide you with support.
Many people choose to communicate through work with the outside world and release their own pressure.
Our work can produce incredible feedback, and more so in the current period.
But take care of yourself as the first one.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can understand your latest situation and make adjustments accordingly.
Prioritization of important work.
We must maintain a normal routine of some important work.
The work of the Trustable Engineering Team, the Human Resources Operations Team, trust and security teams and recruitment teams (and other teams) is crucial, which may require additional support.
We will begin to assess the current objectives together with all sectors and shift the focus of the work to some of the most important things to support our mission.
We all have much work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
The temporary slow pace will not affect future development.
We're not going to "increase progress" after the plague.
We won't ask you to work on the job, because it doesn't seem practical right now.
We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new targets and timetables, as appropriate.
What changes will the APP (annual Plan) make?
In order to adapt to the new realities and demands for daily work, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 annual plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan to spend more time on budgeting, enabling staff to organize key work and to take care of themselves and their families and to arrange for staff adjustment work that is needed or is expected to be reduced in the coming weeks.
The extension of time can significantly reduce the current level of work of the organization as a whole and reduce the pressures of the work.
We will present the above proposals to the Board of Governors next week. If we adopt the proposal, we will be able to update the follow-up arrangements to representatives and groups as soon as possible.
Thank you for the leadership of the APP Group in this process.
The situation in the office, disclosure and cleaning.
Last week, we learned that a colleague at an old Kinjun office may have been in contact with COVID-19.
However, with caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaning personnel to carry out a comprehensive disposal of the office in the old mountains.
They use a hospital-level drug-resulting programme, and the various forms, as well as the large halls and electricity interfaces to our building.
The office building is fulfilling its obligation agreement to use the relevant products to ensure the security of the tenant.
We believe that when everyone decides to return to work, the Office is fully prepared to welcome everyone.
Our Washington County Office is used by the WeWork Office, WeWork sharing with us and all the staff in Washington.
As of last week, the Washington, D.C. Office has been transferred to the full-time office, in accordance with the guidelines shared with the Office of the Old King.
At the same time, as some New York office colleagues know, we have been discussing the relevant issues of the rental site in the Brooklyn area.
These discussions are still ongoing, but may be delayed.
A part of the staff member's first contact with the remote office.
Other long-term staff members of the Office wish to provide some recommendations on the methods of adjustment for these staff members:
The meeting will be held within two hours.
If more time is required, consider dividing the content of the meeting into several dates.
The objectives of the Conference are clearly defined, the development of the agenda of the Conference and the forward delivery of material.
The videoconferencing is used as a default format of meetings, while using Google Docs and Zoom tools.
At each meeting, a chairperson presided over the meeting, organized a person responsible for monitoring questions in the chat window and followed up on the changes in the list of speakers, and arranged another member (or in collaboration with multiple persons) helped to record the meeting.
If you need a suitable earphone, please send e-mail to the technical support sector.
Buy food using your health allowance.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack, discuss distribution work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying human engineering guidance in the form of the Network Seminar, helping to improve the efficiency of work for the entire Foundation's staff during the division of offices.
Last week, we requested that all community recipients be informed of public activities financed by Wikimedia, such as through the release of Wikimedia before the outbreak of the virus.
These requirements for the elimination of activities and other restrictions may lead to the failure of the beneficiaries of these communities to complete their original contribution activities, and we have informed them that we understand this, and we have promised that none of them will be punished for delaying or modifying these objectives.
In the next week, we will continue to provide further guidance at the Wikimania and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community now seems to be embroiled in the grief caused by the damage caused by the virus, but it is also a source of comfort to be able to maintain a clear focus on its communities, Wikimedia and other aspects.
In the future, the CRT Group will set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide the community with a space to monitor the impact of the community and to track the community's interaction with us.
Keep in touch, contact COVID-19 related issues
We planned to hold a special workshop on Thursday at 4:00 (the world's time) at 07:00 (the Pacific Time), and we will send the relevant invitations to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we will share some of the latest information, answer your questions and spend some time talking to everyone.
We are united, and here we are loyal to help you.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information referred to in this e-mail as well as other important information related to COVID-19.
The CRT Group will update these pages in time and concentrate all information on one another.
We are trying to maintain regular contact with staff in countries/areas who are currently severely affected by the virus.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major work processes or insurance, or need other assistance, please contact the CRT team and cooperate with it at any time.
We are here to give you the support and contact we need.
If you have any issues of concern or sensitivity, please send an e-mail to the Director of the Global Human Resources Operation, Brian Juden.
Although we face these changes, we cannot give up our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, this vaccine alerts us that we may now need to adjust our work and obligations in an unprecedented manner in the past.
We believe that these measures are essential to enable us to support each other in carrying out our work, to provide the necessary support for our actions, and to continue to bring their services to the world.
It's time to make a good plan, and it's not a challenge.
Now, please support one another and create space for the important work of the next few weeks and months.
We need all the contributing forces to achieve this goal, so we ask everyone to take care of ourselves and our families so that they can maintain the best position when needed.
Finally, let's all put our hands in the register and face it.
Katherine, CRT Group (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D,Gregory V,Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) respect the other members of the lead team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2, ACE2) is a layer of outer cells (cellular cells) attached to the lungs, the lungs, the heart, the lungs and the lungs.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme, ACE by reducing the levels of blood pressure II and by increasing the levels of Ang (1-7) by reducing the levels of blood pressure.
The human source version of this pen is usually referred to as hACE2.
Blood pressure conversion 2 is a metallic acid located on the inside of the cells and other cells.
ACE2 Protein contains a N-endic acid M2 structure and a C-end C-endic acid transporting protein structure.
ACE2 is a single I-type protein, whose active structure is exposed to the cell surfaces of the lungs and other organizations.
Another, called Sheddase, decomposes ACE2's cell structure from cross-sectional structures, releases the soluble protein into the blood and eventually releases it into the lungs.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cells, primarily to the lung type II cells, to the small toes, to the brains, to the most organs to move and to the inner cells and to stimulate torso-like cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression was found in the brain, the brain, the brain, and the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is to balance the ACE.
ACE Dispersion of blood pressure I as a blood pressure with blood clotting activity II.
ACE2 subsequently decomposes the blood pressure II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and pours its water into a blood-extreme-intensive (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also dissipate a number of other types of acids, including depletion of acid 9 and apeline, neurodepressants, antifungals A and fatty acids.
ACE2 is also able to adjust the transport of slC6A19 protein in the middle of the oxygen chain, and is related to Hartnup disease.
ACE2 is the main entry point for certain contaminants into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 are associated with ACE2's cell surface structure, resulting in an internal role that contributes to the joint transfer of the virus and the tumor into the cells.
This entry process also requires the activation of TMPRSS2, which causes S, which is currently studying the possibility of a potential treatment. Some people think that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help to fight infection.
However, a number of professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard ACE medications and ARB treatments continue to be used.
A system evaluation and analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE-containing agents can significantly reduce the risk of lung cancer by 34 per cent compared to the group".
And, "The use of ACE medication will also reduce the risk of lung cancer for those who are at higher risk of lung disease, especially those who are depressed and depressed.
The use of ACE is also related to reducing the mortality rate related to lung cancer, but the results are not as reliable as the overall risk of lung cancer. "
The regrouper ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method of treating acute lung damage, which seems to improve the acute respiratory stress resulting from blood flow and blood flow patterns and levels of oxygen.
rhACE2 in the human body is approximately 10 hours, working time is 30 minutes, and working process (sustainable time) is 24 hours.
A number of studies have shown that rhACE2 may be a very promising drug for patients with angiotensin nervous system (renin-angiotensin system, RAS) for patients with an intolerance or a high level of cirrhosis II.
b'COVID-19 The application is a mobile software that is designed to respond to the 2019-20 virus virus virus, to help track closely the contact and identify individuals who may have been affected by the infection ("the contactant").
A number of areas and jurisdictions have developed or submitted many applications with the support of the official government.
A large number of frameworks have been established for the construction of a closely associated tracking process.
The issue of privacy has also caused many concerns, especially in some systems, where the geographical location of the application users needs to be monitored.
The low-invasive alternative programmes include the distance between the use of bluetongue records users and other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, the Kung fu and Zhao Joint Declaration will direct this support for the use of bluetongue into the IOS operating system.
In China, the Government has developed a set of application procedures jointly with the payment of babies to support the civilian self-checking of COVID-19 patients.
The process has now been used in more than 200 cities in China, and Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
This section is developed by the local IT community, published as an open software and will be transferred to the Government. North Macedonia has launched a section of the application "StopKorona" based on the Bluetooth-based "StopKorona" program, which helps medical agencies to respond quickly to the situation of potential infections.
The application procedure was developed by the Ministry of Communications Technology and the Ministry of Health in northern Macedonia.
As at 14 April 2020, the application is pending approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government announced that the closely contact person tracking applications have entered the development stage and will be introduced within a few weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar application procedure ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering the TraceTogether application process based on Singapore and the BlueTrace agreement. Russia plans to launch a geographical range of applications for patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering of the University of Pediatrics, listed some practical issues that might exist, including false reports, and that only a small group of people could use the application.
The dissemination of the application process for misleading or harmful "smoothing virus" has limited the type of organization that can be issued in the crop-based application store, i.e. only to "official" or other good-looking organizations.
Similar restrictions have been imposed on Kong and Amazon.
The private defenders expressed concern about the extensive monitoring of the use of vaccine applications, in particular after the elimination of the threat of vaccination, whether or not the monitoring infrastructure built to respond to the virus virus is to be removed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organizations called for restrictions on such monitoring.
These organizations have announced eight conditions for Government projects to be met:
(c) Monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
(c) The extension of monitoring and monitoring must be subject to the provisions of "days";
Data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and evidence of effective protection;
Digitalization monitoring must be avoided by increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing between third parties shall be defined by law;
It is necessary to provide safeguards to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required to participate effectively, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. The list of verifications has also been issued by the German Computers Club (CCC) and the Non-State Journalist Organization (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF).
The Kung/Kong proposed plan aims to address the issue of sustainable monitoring and, once no trace is required, remove it from the equipment operating system.
Some countries have adopted network-based, rather than application-based tracking, where users are not required to download applications, while avoiding follow-up.
In Israel, network-based follow-up has been approved.
There may be serious private issues in the network solutions to access to original data.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal data; many of the private protection systems that are now created using the central servers have been created (see below).
The State has launched a paragraph that is not based on application procedures for the follow-up of contactees.
The system does not use a specific application procedure, but instead of choosing to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile equipment tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine these information and send notifications to potential infected persons through communication.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the Government was also authorized to open up information, as the country made a major adjustment to the privacy law following the outbreak of the MERS virus.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites, and some countries (including Germany) use central and private protection systems while considering.
Specific details have not yet been published as at 6 April 2020.
The follow-up to private protection contacts is a well-known concept, with a wide range of relevant research documents available as of 7 April 2020. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 groups of experts were studying privacy protection solutions, such as the distance between the use of low-carbon (BLE) recording users and other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordination programme that includes central and disaggregated approaches, not a single agreement. Dissociate agreements include the separation of privacy-protection approaches (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly known as the contact case number, CEN), private sensitive agreements and mobile communication tracking mechanisms (PACT) etc.
In accordance with these agreements, identificationd individual data will never leave equipment, and all matching will be carried out on equipment.
The private team of the UNOCI Media Laboratory has been developing the SafePaths platform, which will use private protection technologies when collecting and using location or route data to track COVID-19.
The platform, based on the application process published in March 2020, is independent: it maintains personal privacy in the context of the vaccine. In addition, a company that originally created and committed to developing a similar platform called SafeTrace, was created in the media lab of the Union Institute of Engineering and is committed to developing private technology.
SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support user-friendly location and health data sharing to other users and officials without harming data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups jointly established a global TCN Union with the aim of reducing fragmented information and supporting the global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in achieving a wide range of applications.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that its official Government's application procedure was an open BlueTrace agreement.
On 10 April 2020, the KOKO and the IOS mobile platform, respectively, announced a closely associated tracking plan, claiming that the plan combines low-function technology with private-protection and can play a role in protecting privacy.
In addition, they have published core technical norms used in the system.
The Fong and Kong said that the system plan had been launched in three stages:
Launch some tools to support the creation of the Government's safe use of ODA tracking applications
The direct integration of this function into the iOS and the ACE systems, the Kung fu and the Ginger Plan, first introduced the system through operational updates, and then through the threat of infection, will be eliminated by the same means to address the monitoring problem.
b The re-establishment of drugs (also referred to as re-use, reassessment, re-distribution or re-treatment) means that a drug that has been approved should be converted to other uses to treat different diseases or medical conditions with which it was originally developed.

Several social media articles have helped to promote speculation, claiming that COVID-19 has been found behind the virus and that vaccines have been available.
All the patents mentioned in various social media articles refer to existing other vaccines (such as SARS) that are used to treat gene sequences and vaccines.
2019 COVID-19 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by type 2 SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, nausea and vomiting.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, pain, loss of consciousness and pain.
The patient's potential is 2-14 days apart, usually about 5 days.
Although most cases are relatively low, some cases develop into pathogens and multi-organisms.
As of 17 April 2020, the total number of cases reported by 210 countries and regions worldwide exceeds 224,000 cases, with more than 153,000 deaths.
There are currently more than 568,000 people treated. The virus is mainly spread through close contact between people and people, often by the use of the sneezes, when it hits or talks.
Despite the effects of the air currents, it usually falls to the surface or surfaces of the objects, and does not cause far-fetched contamination.
In addition, if someone touched the face of the virus and then touched his nose again, he could also be infected.
The virus can last for 72 hours on the surface of the object.
Although pre- and post-recovery periods may also be disseminated, the most potent three days prior to the disease is the standard method of testing for reversible reversibility of the vertebral column (rRT-PCR).
It is suggested to suspect that the infected and their caregivers are wearing the mask.
There is a difference between the recommendations of public procurement and that of some authorities, others, and the requirements of the procurement process.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine or anti-virus treatment programme yet.
Most of the six countries in the WHO region have reported on the presence of the disease.
Victims may also have symptoms such as fever, fever, lack of strength and enthusiasm.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or chest pain, confusion of consciousness, difficulty awakening and swelling of the face or mouth; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended that the doctor be immediately.
A small number of cases may be associated with respiratory symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or headaches.
It also monitors the various proportions of cirrhosis, such as nausea, vomiting, and vomiting.
In some cases, Chinese diseases occur in the early stages of breast and heart disease.
Some cases of disease may develop into pathogens, multi-organism dysfunction, or even death.
We call it a subperiod.
The subperiod of COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may be extended to 2-14 days.
97.5 per cent of the infected will have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report notes that not all of the infected people will have symptoms.
The role of pathogens in the spread of infectious diseases has not yet been fully clear; however, initial evidence shows that pathogens may promote the spread of disease.
The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20 per cent of the cases in the hospital did not show any symptoms during the hospital.
Since 1 April, the National Health Commission of China has reported cases of disease-free from day to day; there are 130 (78 per cent) cases of infection in 166 infected persons on that day.
The fluids and fluids can carry large amounts of viruses.
More flying than normal speech.
One study in Singapore found that unscathed phalanx could lead to the most distant spread of the fly 4.5 meters (15 meters).
Although such viruses are not generally transmitted through air, the U.S. National Sciences Institute has found that they may be transmitted through biogas waves, and the radio-collection sample of RNAs on the outside of the room is detected.
Medical procedures such as injecting and heart failure (CPR) may cause respiratory fibrosis and air circulation.
Some fear that the virus may be spread through the lungs, but this risk is considered to be lower. The incidence of the virus is stronger when the patient is in the condition; although it is likely to spread before the disease, the risk is lower.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) notes that although the transmission of new vaccines is still not fully clear, the virus is usually transmitted by 2-3 people.
In particular, new vaccines have been known to survive on paper one day, for the maximum three days on plastic (combined) and non-alcohol (AISI 304) and for the maximum four hours on pure sugar products.
However, their survival is also affected by the humidity and temperature.
If used properly, fatty acids and cleaning products can also cause the death of the virus. Fats can reduce the level of protein protection of the virus and can also be removed from the skin and other surfaces.
A study in Hong Kong from China showed that there was an average of two days after entry into the hospital.
5/6 of the first sample of the virus, 1/6 of the patients being tested for the highest of the virus tested on the second day.
A type 2 of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three patients with chronic respiratory system diseases.
All characteristics of this new type of SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural environment.
Before the virus enters the human body, it is possible for the user to kill it because it can damage the protection of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most serious organs affected by the COVID-19, as this virus is converted into the upper cell of the upper cell of the lungs, which is the highest in the second lung cell of the lungs.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and entered the main cell through a special face-to-face called "mixture".
In patients treated in China's violent hospital, 12 per cent of the infected have experienced acute heart damage and a higher proportion of patients with severe diseases.
Because of the deterioration of the disease, the overall immune system has been affected and the incidence of heart disease is higher, but acute heart damage may also be associated with a heart attack of ACE2.
ACE2 is expressed high in the heart and participates in heart coordination.
It has been reported that COVID-19 infected blood clots (31%) and spleen clots (25%) occur higher and may be related to premature failure. COVID-19 The deaths of the dead have been detected by DAD, and within the lungs, they have found cirrhosis of the pancreas.
Although SARS-COV-2 is resistant to ACE2's respiratory tract, COVID-19 patients with severe diseases will experience a complete hypersensitivity reaction.
In particular, COVID-19 patients are associated with the collection and serious lung disease of T cells in the body of GM-CSF.
It's the same thing that the body's report has seen in the coroner's cell.
WHO published a number of disease testing programmes.
The standard test method is the use of a real-time reversible combination (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually tested for respiratory samples obtained through bone marrow; however, it can also be used for kidney or fluid samples.
In general, results can be obtained within hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but two blood samples are collected every two weeks, with almost no immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the fungal virus and publish gene sequences in order to develop an independent PCR test in laboratories all over the world to test whether the virus is infected.
As at 4 April 2020, resistance testing (not only to check active infections but also to check whether individuals have been infected with the virus) is still under development, but it has not been expanded.
According to China's experience, the test was just 60 per cent to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first immediate testing product and entered into use at the end of that month. The study guide published by the University of Athens's South American Hospital for Diabetes and Diabetes Risk Surveys was presented on the basis of a method of testing of infection based on the diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease.
Early infections are seen in the double-blind glass film, which has a non-smoker and a later part of the week.
As the virus develops, there may be signs of deterioration in the chest, fractures (a slight increase in the number of lungs with different degrees) and changes in the lungs.
There are very little information on micropathic damage and pathology.
The main pathology of the examination was found to be as follows:
Body eye inspection: chestnuts, heart attacks, lung changes, and urinary disorders
Observes four critical levels of viral lung disease:
Light bulbs: hydrochloric acid, hydrochloric acid growth, mass of non-standard lung cells, inter-species anti-symbols, and multiple-nuclear cell formation
Dizziness: DAD
DAD is a disease that causes acute respiratory traction (ARDS) and severe low blood pressure.
Reinforced lung: Fluorinated and interluental cirrhosis
Blood: Arrhythmia (DIC); Small White and Young Red Cell Reactions
Prevention measures can be taken to reduce the rate of infection, including: stay in the home; avoid entry into the densely populated region; often using shower and water washers and at least 20 seconds on a continuous basis; maintain good respiratory health; and avoid touching eyes, noses or mouth if not washed.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that the mouth of the paper should be closed when it is in or out of the mouth; if there is no paper, it is recommended to use the intestines.
It is recommended that clean hands be properly cleaned after washing or washing.
The CDC recommends that a public forum be set up to prevent the spread of HIV in some areas of the public and prevent the spread of disease-free people. The core of social exclusion strategies is to close schools and places of work, restricting and eliminating large public meetings, thus reducing the opportunities for infection to contact large groups.
In addition, the social distance standard provides for at least 6 metres (1.5 m) of distance in human relations.
There is still no effective drug prevention of COVID-19. In view of the expected development of vaccines by 2021 at least, efforts to reduce the risk of infection are the key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is what we know is the "Lapillian pathology curve".
At the same time, CDC has recommended that people often use fatty and water-free hands for at least 20 seconds, especially when there is obvious contamination in the back or hands, before and after the back of the nose, or after the nose.
In addition, it is recommended to use at least 60 per cent of the alcohol content of the washing machine, but not only does it have moisture and water. WHO has provided two combinations for the production of land.
These partners stimulate antiviral activity through nausea or vomiting.
Using Oxic acid to help eliminate the acidic acid in the alcohol; Oxic acid is not a "manipulative substance".
Add carbon as a confectionery.
Supportive care for people, which may include fluid treatment, oxygen support and other important organs that are affected.
CDC suggests suspects that the virus carrier has a simple mouthpiece.
It is now being used to reduce respiratory infections, but its benefits are still being studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal health and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits, thus improving immunization.
WHO and the National Health Commission of China have launched initiatives calling for COVID-19 patients who are well cared for in the hospital.
The United States of America's pathological and breast-feeding experts have compiled a list of treatment recommendations submitted by the agencies and made available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 has not been developed.
Some medical experts suggest that the use of anti-hypertensive pain (for cirrhosis of the pancreas) should be replaced by a line of treatment for bronchosm.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of virus spread and to complete the possible operation of air bubbles in the medical environment, such as injecting or using hand-to-hand air protection.
In addition to the adoption of standard preventive measures to address preventive measures and air-transmission prevention measures, CDC recommended that patients be transferred to the air-transmission separation room (AIIR). CDC briefed the guidelines for use of individual protective equipment (PPE) during vaccination.
Pre-handling equipment: PPE Protect your clothes, breathing machine or mouthpiece, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use respiratory (not oral).
N95 can be used together in the industry, but FDA has been authorized to use it on the basis of emergency authorisation (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of effluent (such as phytosanitary) but does not ensure effective separation of specific biological products when used in other uses.
If there's no mouthpiece, CDC recommends using a facepiece, you can turn it off when you need it.
Most COVID-19 cases are mild and do not need to use mechanical air or other options, but a certain proportion of cases require such measures.
Medical personnel are actively conducting studies to provide respiratory support for patients with COVID-19 who experience respiratory symptoms. There is evidence that stress can be avoided with high blood pressure or double blood pressure.
It is still unclear whether the two treatment programmes mentioned above could have the same effect on patients with severe diseases.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use mechanical air conditioning, as this technology can also restrict the spread of airborne radiation. The disease is the parent of older people (especially older than 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, the number of patients is not sufficient, given the limitations of medical conditions, the medical system is unable to respond to the severe situation of patients with COVID-19 cases leading to the need for hospital treatment.
A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients had to be sent to the hospital, 2.3 per cent of patients needed mechanical air and 1.4 per cent of patients would die.
In China, approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients were finally sent to ICU.
As the development of the acute respiratory traction (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 increases in the complexity of the engine, the difficulties of the ozone layer are increasing.
At that time, support for pressure control modes and high PEEP respiratory equipment was needed to minimize the risk of respiratory damage and respiratory damage.
The old respiratory system may not be able to achieve high.
Since January 2020, a number of anti-hazardous drugs have now entered the phase of sleep testing.
Red Sea appears to be the most potent drug in the world.
Although new drugs may have been developed by 2021 only, some of the drugs that have been tested have been approved for other uses or have entered the high-test phase.
Patients with severe diseases may try to use anti-haemorrhages.
WHO calls for a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential treatment effectiveness and safety tests. FDA has been authorized to reinstate blood transfusions as experimental treatment and treat life-threatening patients with life-threatening diseases.
There has not yet been a need to study sleeping in order to demonstrate whether this treatment can be effectively treated safely.
In February 2020, China issued a mobile application for the outbreak of infectious diseases.
User needs to enter name and ID number as requested.
This paragraph can judge potential infection risks by monitoring data testing "close contact".
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
When assessing potential risks, the application will not only recommend isolation but also send a warning to local health officials. Integrated use of mobile data analysis, field identification technology, telephone tracking and human intelligence, monitoring of infected persons and their contacts in the country, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government authorized security agencies to track the phone data of suspects who were infected with the virus.
The purpose of this measure is to force separation and to protect the possibility of contact with groups infected by infected citizens.
Similarly, in March 2020, German telecommunications shared the total mobile location data from Robert Koh Institute of the Federal Government of Germany in order to study and prevent the spread of virus.
Russian field identification technology for testing persons who are in contravention of the provisions of separation.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulia Gallera, noted that mobile phone operators data show "40 per cent of the citizens still on four occasions".
The Government of Germany organized a 48-hour weekend meal with more than 42,000 participants.
Moreover, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for an innovative solution to prevent the spread of witness virus worldwide.
The separation, restrictions, side effects, or concern about self-infection may no longer cause anxiety.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Social isolation, isolation, health anxiety, pressure and economic uncertainty are the perfect storm of mental health and well-being."
Such diseases are milder, and they are less likely to show symptoms similar to those of other common respiratory diseases, such as common symptoms.
The cases of mild disease can usually be recovered within two weeks and the cases of serious or serious illness may require three to six weeks of recovery.
According to other similar virus data (such as SARS and MERS), pregnant women develop a higher risk for patients with severe COVID-19, but lack of COVID-19 data support. COVID-19 may have an impact on parts of the lungs and lead to inflammation.
In the most severely affected areas, COVID-19 may develop rapidly as an acute respiratory tract (ARDS) resulting in respiratory failure, haemorrhage or multi- organ failure.
COVID-19 The associated and related diseases include haemorrhage, haemorrhage, and heart, liver and liver damage.
6% of the COVID-19 patients in the hospital had bleeding abnormality, especially prolonged bleeding, while 4% of the patients in the group had abnormal bleeding function.
About 20-30 per cent of COVID-19 patients have an increase in liver disease.
According to the same report, the average time from the disease to the death is 10 days, of which the average stay time is five days.
However, the average time for ICU patients to enter the hospital was seven days.
Early disease studies found that the average time from early illness to death was 14 days and total time was 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC) found that the rate of male death was 2.8 per cent and that the rate of female death was 1.7 per cent.
The pathological examination of the OCT shows that both lungs appear to be mutatis mutandis and vertebrates.
The lung cells have been observed to alter the virus cell.
The lung images are similar to the emergency breathing complexion (ARDS).
In the case of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, 11.8 per cent are causing heart damage due to elevated levels of protein protein or heart disease.
According to data published in the United States in March, 89 per cent of those in the hospital had prior to the disease. Medical supplies and regional socio-economic conditions could also affect the mortality rate.
In view of regional differences and difficulties in methods, the estimated mortality rate of disease is different.
A low incidence of infectious diseases may lead to high mortality.
However, if the death of the disease is due to previous infections, it may mean that the present mortality rate has been underestimated.
In comparison with non-smokers, smokers develop several rates of COVID-19 patients up to 1.4 times, and need resuscitation or death rates up to 2.4 times. People are concerned about the long-term afterlife of this disease.
According to the Hong Kong Hospital Administration of China, some recoverers fell by 20 per cent to 30 per cent, and the lung scan showed damage to their organs.
Moreover, post-rehabilitation may occur after rehabilitating.
As of March 2020, it has not yet been established that infection can lead to long-term effective immunization.
In accordance with the characteristics of other vaccines, immunization may occur, but some of the COVID-19 cases are reported to be post-rehabilitated post-rehabilitation tester.
These cases are considered to be persistent infection rather than re-infection.
This virus is considered a natural virus, originating from animals, through infection.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the scope of infection is almost entirely human.
The first 41 cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020, showed that the earliest date of the disease was 1 December 2019.
The earliest occurrence date of WHO official publication is December 8, 2019.
A number of methods are commonly used to measure mortality.
These figures vary from time to time, and are subject to monitoring, quality of health systems, treatment programmes, early outbreaks of infections, and age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 Emergency Disease code U07.1 SARS-CoV-2 Victims of Death, U07.2 Appointed of COVID-19, but not of the Laboratory. The mortality rate is equivalent to the total number of deaths granted within a time range, except for the total number of cases of illness.
According to statistics at John Hopkins University, as at 17 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measurement criteria also include cases of death (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which were seen as a percentage of the number of patients who died of the disease and as a percentage of the number of people who died of the disease (including the number of patients who did not).
These statistics have no time limit, and follow-up is the whole process of solving infection and disease.
Although not all infections can cause antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people infected.
Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with only 4600 inhabitants, now 80 (1.7%) dying from the epidemic.
In Gangelt, vaccines spread through several holiday days, even among young people, but death rates are relatively low and not all cases of death are officially classified as COVID-19.
In addition, the German medical system is no longer burdensome.
Blood donors' assessments show that about 3 per cent of Dutch citizens are likely to have resistance.
To date, 69 (0.004 per cent of total population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
Vaccination and mortality rates vary from gender to gender.
Studies in China and Italy show that men's mortality rates are higher than women.
50-60, the highest risk of death of men, with only a 90-year-old gender gap.
China's male mortality rate is 2.8 per cent and female mortality is 1.7 per cent.
The exact causes of such gender differences are still unclear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.
Based on gender-based immunization differences, female smoking rates are lower and men are less congenital (such as high blood pressure) than women, leading to higher rates of male mortality than women.
In Europe, 57 per cent of men are infected with men and more than 72 per cent of men are killed due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the United States Government has not followed gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different impacts on men and women.
The proportion of women's health workers (in particular nurses) is higher and the rate of exposure to the virus is higher.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official designation of such disease as "COVID-19".
WHO official Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains this: The first outbreak of the disease (Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus) on behalf of CO on the scene, VI on the virus, D on the scene on the scene, 19 on the first outbreak of the disease (19 December 31st, 2019).
Therefore, this name is chosen in order to avoid the introduction of specific geographical locations (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, in line with the recommendations of the International Name for the Prevention of Pollution. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called a type of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In addition, WHO used "COVID-19 virus" and "induced COVID-19" in public broadcasting.
Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "squamous virus".
During the first outbreak of the flu in China, the virus and disease are commonly referred to as "squamous virus" and "squamous virus".
On 1 January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCOV be named as a temporary virus and disease based on guidelines for use in the names of disease and virus.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Given the limitations of the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers started printing health materials such as bone marrow and respiratory components.
For example, a hospital in Italy urgently needs windmills, the supplier cannot deliver parts within the time required, a local original firm is going back to the engineering, and 100 windmills needed to be printed between night and night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 vaccines, assumptions regarding the origin of disease, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of fraud, false information and false information coverage were quickly disseminated through the network.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study found no evidence of virus replication in dogs, rats and dogs.
No medicines or vaccines used to treat such diseases have yet been approved.
Government agencies, academic groups and industrial researchers are actively conducting international research to develop vaccines and drugs treated with COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "unity test" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing anti-hazardous compounds currently most likely to be treated.
There are still no vaccines at present, but agencies at all levels are actively developing alternative vaccines.
As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been introduced into human cells through ACE2, prior work results are needed.
Three vaccination strategies are being studied.
First of all, research personnel are planning to develop total virus vaccines.
The use of such viruses, whether non-active or deadly, is intended to stimulate the rapid immune response of the human body when new COVID-19 is infected.
The second approach is to develop a vaccine to develop an exciting immune system that responds to certain Asian units that are vulnerable to the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies focus on specialized HIV infection in the ACE2 infected S infectious agents.
The third approach is to develop nuclear vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines, a new type of vaccine technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the vaccines developed by the above-mentioned strategies must be tested. On 16 March 2020, four Asian volunteers launched their first vaccination test.
Vaccination has been considered to be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but there is a contradiction.
As of April 2020, more than 300 sleep tests were conducted.
Seven trials completed the assessment and were approved for treatment of malaria, including four studies on chlorofluorocarbons or chlorofluorocarbons.
The transfer of anti-virus drugs is a major part of China's research, and by the end of 4 months nine rehabilitated trials will be carried out in several countries for the third period on Red Sea.
As of April 2020, a review of the progress in the development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has been undertaken. Currently, the existing drug treatment of COVID-19, including Red Sea, CFC and CFC, is being assessed in combination with LVID-19.
As of March 2020, the treatment of Red Sea has been provisionally confirmed.
It was observed that patients who had been treated with Reedcive were reduced in their post-menopausal condition.
In the current phase of the United States, China and Italy are undergoing a phase III sleep test. In February 2020, China launched a study of CFC (previously used to treat malaria) and obtained preliminary results.
However, a call was made for the joint evaluation of the study.
Korea and China's health authorities recommend using chlorine.
However, the Institute for HVV recommended that each day use 1 kilogram, while reminding twice the risk and possibly fatal.
FDA issued an urgent authorisation for the use of CFCs and CFCs on 28 March 2020, but the doctor had the right to decide whether to use these two drug treatment patients COVID-19. China's 7th Guide also provided for the use of contaminants, libavirin or COVID-19.
Initial data show that high levels of libavelin have a detrimental effect on SARS-CoV-2.
After confirming the low-temperature control role of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended that Hunonet be used to conduct further internal studies. The study shows that the primary infectious agents produced by SARS-CoV-2 are the necessary conditions for interacting with ACE2 in humans.
Despite the fact that it is used in combination with achiroxone, there is a serious limitation on the ability of the medical community to accept these treatments unless further studies have been conducted. Osio has no control over SARS-CoV-2, and has not yet found treatment effects on COVID-19.
CVID-19 may be a postoperative treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that chlorofluorocarbons may have an anti-cellular reaction. After completing a small study, the National Health Commission of China will be included in the treatment guidelines.
Italy is conducting a 2-year non-opportunity test following a follow-up test of the results of patients.
In combination with the blood tests of white blood cells, the identification of the cell's cirrhosis and the development of the disease is considered to have led to the death of some of the infected.
In 2017, FDA, with the support of a reminiscent case study, approved the use of white cell interface 6 of a combination of a type of contaminants caused by other causes, namely CAR T, cell therapy.
To date, there has been no opportunity to effectively treat CRS against evidence.
COVID-19 Rehabilitation Disorders caused by the immune system are currently being studied, injecting the need for antibodies to those who are injecting them as immunized medications prior to the successful development of the vaccine.
SARS has tried this strategy during the vaccination period, but treatment has not yet been achieved.
The virus and an expected role mechanism for the prevention of immunization by SARS-CoV-2 is introduced by the immune system.
However, other mechanisms such as immune-dependent cell toxicities and/or convulsions can also have the same effect.
Other forms of immune therapy are currently being developed, such as using human cloning.
Reproductive blood clearance may be increased to facilitate rapid deployment. Blood clearance is made up of fluid components of the blood of the recycling patients, which include special antibodies to this virus.
Diarrhoea, a group of closely related integrated symptoms
Dr. Levinson of the Hospital of the City Centre has increased awareness of the spread of new vaccines, and has not been harmed by COVID-19 and died.
