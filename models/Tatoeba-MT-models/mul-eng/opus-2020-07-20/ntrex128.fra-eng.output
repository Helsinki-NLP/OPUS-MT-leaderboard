Members of the Gales State Assembly concerned about "passing for marionettes"
Gallois elections are held by a proposal to replace their title with the single MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Gallois Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Galileo Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be done by rail.
A working voter said his group was concerned about the fact that the bike "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For non-original readers of the Wales Country: in gallos, twp means stupid, and pwp means crazy.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Part of the Wales Country) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other forms.
The conservative party would be "open" to a change of name, but it noted that between MWP and Muppet (marinnet) the distance is narrow.
In this context, in gallois, the letter you pronounce as the letter or in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the change in names, stated that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly is the latter."
The Law 2007 on the Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act 2017) gives the Galloese Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Galileo Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of the title of members, the Commission considers that Members of the Gallois Parliament (or the WMP), however, a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus might have been a true case for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft law on the change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the discussions on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the change in the country's name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country must now bear the name “Northern Macedonian Republic”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a happy old-fashioned decades between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens insists on the fact that the name of Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its country to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, indicated that he would not take account of the results.
However, participants such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change in name is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, Saint Martin's silenced watches
"The elderly people with whom I have discussed say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on each side of the street," says Adams.
"There is no more than today."
According to him, it is normal for the bars to be rediscovered.
Today, "we don't get too often, he explains.
"Before, we went to the bar as his neighbor, but this is no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds coming from the sale of buildings will be exhausted before those responsible are represented, and this concerns: “Soon or later, they will return to the house.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help to keep the last sanctuarys in the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be mostly whites who will predict the closure of the entire church, as it is unlikely that they will become members," he wondered.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The early white Methodist congregation left places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which served around, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was repatriated by a black community under the direction of River John Howard Johnson, which started a boycott of the 125th Street shops, one of the main trading streets in Harlem, where the Blacks were obliged to employ or receive promotion.
In 1939 a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to reopen and command a new carillion,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the church of Saint Martin, King David Johnson, called with pride the "times of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it another name: "a cultural treasure" and "a historic instrument that is irreplaceable".
It also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took a place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin has not replaced it.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of questions about the rehabilitation of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the lay elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the Paris Council, a body of leadership composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the charges on him, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some Parisians have been disappointed by the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old teenager injured by a shark during a fishing party at home
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old on Saturday last week when he was practicing fishing on the day of the opening of the season in California.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel pointed out to KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy cry for help and he got paid to him to get out of the water.
For the first time, Chad thought that the young boy was putting up with crises of joy to have a take, and then he understood that he was actually
He was dead.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he was presenting an open fraction of the keyboard.
"I'm looking forward to the whole world coming out of water: there's a requin!" Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to the Children's Rady hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The species of the shark at the origin of the attack is unknown.
During a press conference, Deputy Chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the Ponti Beach beach in Casablad up to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles indicates that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered harmless.
Sansbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetic Market
Saninsbury's hands are low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and the branches of ravines similar to those of the supermarket, along with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
In the context of a major increase in the British aesthetic market of 2.8 billion sterling books, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home products are falling, the range of larger beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is final.
Supermarkets are investing today in the beauty market in order to re-use the space previously occupied by television, microwaves and other household items.
Sanisbury indicated that it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which would be understood for the first time by brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaxs its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of non-tested products on animals, which is increasingly important among young consumers.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsburys stores, the first open in the last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second which is scheduled for opening in the current year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to raise their heads to attract consumers, who are more inclined to carry out their online purchases and to go to nearby stores for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sansburys, said that sales points will further resemble large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Saninsbury has put in place Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to promote sales of current consumer goods and to make purchases.
The previous attempts to restructure the ranges of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products from the British chain had been overcome by a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury tried a partnership with Boots, but it ended up in a controversy about the distribution of benefits from pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
It was after he sold 3 years ago his 281 pharmaceuticals for a total of 125 million sterling books in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, which the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role there that was to introduce in 4 stores a wide range of brands of care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Saninsburys, announced that the appearance of beauty products has been changed to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to respond to all kinds of needs and, thanks to the design of our radios and the ideal situation of our facilities, our governance of the cosmetics market is now inconsistencies and changes buying habits," said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' color after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of £11 million
E-mail from Dragon's Den television program, Peter Jones, after announcing the withdrawal of an animator Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million related to his home decoration brand, to be dedicated to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At the age of 37, this morning's animator announced on Instagram that she was back.
Holly Willoughby became angry with Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, withdrawing from their fruitful textile and interior decoration activities in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources reported that Jones was angry when the dear television child found out that, at a meeting that took place under stress at the headquarters of the commercial empire of Dragon's Den in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), his new contracts, with a total of 1.5 million sterling books, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their decoration brand and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was similar to that of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, announced on Instagram that she had left Truly, Jones sat in his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Great Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was far from one of Holly's priorities
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left the whole world without a vote.
No one could imagine what would happen tomorrow, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is full of products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the launch of this morning's animator, which includes the most "bankable" celebrations in Britain, could cost millions to society due to important investments in products that are far from customs or customs, clothes or articles of the interior, and the risk of late launch.
In addition, this could lead to a long - term friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples participated together on holidays and Peter Jones held 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animator of the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A close source from Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was boring, but finally we are going to love it.
Trump was shocked by the media that criticized him for his comment that some judges "inhibited a president", and to show such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
"Why has President Trump been so late?"
he ran, taking a voice from a TV journalist.
“I haven’t missed anything.”
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had shown interest in holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified for the first time, which took place in Singapore in June, far from the North Korea Declaration.
However, negotiations on this decollarization are at the point of death.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, declared Saturday to the world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, that the United States had no "response" to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his collection speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"Everything goes well with North Korea," said the President of North America.
We fought the armed conflict.
“ Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have resulted in positive results: the end of the missile shooting trials, the release of hostages and the rest of the American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justifies his unusual approach to Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to play the role of President, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-fledged gear, there's no more than 200 ahead of me," he criticised with the right to the people.
Tsunami: an island destroyed and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that swept Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was not necessarily necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, but no state of national disaster has been described, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have many times clearly stated that they did not want international assistance, which is a little complicated," laments Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children's Organisation has set up a team to return to Palu, it does not always know whether work on the ground will be allowed.
The national disaster management agency spokesman, Mr. Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be authorized to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the droughts that it is experiencing constantly, the country is in desperate need of means to open its doors to nature.
Refugees have been moved to Aceh, but they are rare in other litoral areas.
Although a warning has been delivered, no alarm siren has stayed in Palu, which has no doubt contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not easy.
Natural disasters make it increasingly difficult to use transport.
A hospital ship that had been placed in Lombok to care for the victims is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, put on board the reform of the infrastructure that was broken down at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable sums to reimburse the roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has led to Mr. Joko's government, called to represent the electors next year.
The head of state of Indonesia is also subject to pressures related to the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been kidnapped from their homes, based on confrontations in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machets, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.

I call them especially taxi drivers, who would have been able to catch something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with all the critical information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she lived.
This morning, people who claimed to know the woman were present at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.

Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of an attempt to re-writing history
Its prohibition would be the righteous return of things, in view of acts of destruction, of numerous religious and cultural assets in England, made by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Talibans.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "reasonable" and has qualified it as a "revisionist attempt".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that, "in view of the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was evident that Oliver Cromwell's rise to the Westminster Palace was not to be spared.
Cromwell didn't order or take the iconoclacy in English civil wars.
It is likely that he was sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas during the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell, sculptured by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft, testifies to the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still admire."
Mr. Goldsmith said on Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressures, I mean the monarchy.
Whether this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly notable figure that represents a side of the fracturing.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and remembered.”
China: A cow kills a lifter
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a coke in a market in the southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the bloodthirsty and covered near a pigeon on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, indicated the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig raiser is prepared to inject pigs vaccines into a piggy, on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door of the neighbor's Porcherie was open.
He claims that a huge male porcupine was found inside and that blood flowed from his throat.
A medical report confirms that the 250 kg weighted animal mutilated the lifter to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the driver's cousin, stated that his legs were "brained and covered with blood".
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04h40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death was neither the lift nor his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was pregnant to avoid any other incident and to allow police to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, swine attacks against people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously damaging the last one.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig began a gallous lift on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, while an Oregon lifter came to be destroyed by his cocoons, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause such behavior.
"These animals are rather players,
They have no intention of doing evil.
It's enough to show them the respect they deserve," he said.
The remains of Uragan Rosa should cause strong precipitation in the southern United States
According to forecasts, the Rosa uragan weakens as it moves over colder waters from the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be responsible for violations in the north-east of Mexico and the south-west of the United States over the coming days.
The winds were at 135 km/h (category 1) hurricane from 5:00 a.m. in the morning, the East hour, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The uragan should move north on Sunday.
During this period, depression begins to rise above the Pacific Ocean and to the east, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the low California Peninsula in the form of storm, the U.S. Ouragan Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the North, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create generalised torrential rains in the West over the coming days.
At the local level, threats between 2.5 cm and 10 cm will cause serious Sudanese crossings, droughts and potential landslides in the desert.
The adverse reactions will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per hour, including in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in the south-west regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Tropical leaks are likely to cause sudden floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intensive rains could turn cannons into depleted rivers and hurricanes would produce wind and dust turbines by place.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local floods in some southern parts of the country, on the California litoral.
The total fluoride can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in weak debris curves and make the fluorescent layer.
It could be the first rain of the dry season in the region.
Tropical divergences will reach Arizona at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitations will take place in the four corners of the Tuesday country and will last until Wednesday.
Important changes in temperature are to be planned for the month of October through the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of tropicals will remain warm,
which sometimes causes radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which rises on Sundays of considerable temperature differences, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A large part of the centre and east of the United States should be known as a hot start in October, with temperatures around 26 degrees south and other northerly regions.
The mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Several days forecasts indicate that temperatures should be above average in the east of the United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million TV viewers.
Sent on 6 Thursday television channels, the discerning hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse is losing, the broadcasting services have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a series of theatres: an agreement designed by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of charges.
Christine Ford made sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, was exposed to assaults on his person and tried to remove his clothes during an evening between the students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate retreat, also claimed to be some 100 per cent that this had never happened.
According to a report from Nielsen, the process has probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TV viewers.
The numbers of other channels spreading the process, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the process has attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose sponsors widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most screened during the day of the hearings, with an average of 5.69 million TV viewers.
ABC was in second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
Following CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
The interest did not fail once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a communication in which it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras launched a scene in which the senator was involved by the protesters while he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake lowers his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of direct interpolation.
"Don't look anymore, look at me," one of the women leaves.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are demonized.”
Before the elevator doors were mentioned, Blake indicated that his office had published a statement and that he would refer to it more at the Commission meeting.
All cabled and broadcast network channels would cover the meeting directly within a few hours, while the judicial committee was prepared to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake points out, however, that a week's investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on allegations made against the candidate, which called for minority democracies.
Flake left partially convinced by discussing with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after having been held with Coons and several other senators.
His choice was heavy in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate the allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
United Kingdom: May accuse the opposition in Brexit of making the "small political"
In an interview given in Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the sponsors of his project to leave the European Union, to make the "small political" to the detriment of the future of Great Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, publishing a photo of Theresa May in the cover, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on Chequers' plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "very ridiculous".
Wade Sims: The police stop Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the source of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect of the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU investigator.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was excommunicated and charged with murder at the second grade, reported the Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities published a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his shifts.
Found on the crime scene, the moons carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, CBS's branch.
During his interrogation, Simpson advised the police to be responsible for Wade's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The medical office of the Baton-Rouge parish has published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death has been caused by a wound by a bullet that has passed through the head and lived in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police medical laboratory, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of the order for their "enforcement and demand for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the big player in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it marked 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebonds per match during the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach declared that the team was "damaged and under the shock" after the news of Wade's death.
"We're going to waste this kind of event all the time," Wade laments.
Mexico: A Volcano of Cendres
From the centenary leaving the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that the Mexicans stay away from the volcano, after having recorded some activity in the crater, with 183 gas and greenhouse emissions at 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On the social networks, images were shown in thin layers covering cars in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in activity at the Volcano level of 72 km from the capital, since a quake of 7.1 rocking the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalogue: Police and separatists encounters near the anniversary of the vote for independence
Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after encounters between independent protesters and the anti-meditated police, while thousands of protesters joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being rejected by anti-embedded police, masked separatists threw their eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not perform tourists.
Disengagementers also released later in the day, while the police used matracs to contain the attacks.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence who had "not forgotten or forgiven" were confronted by Unionists calling for "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators who had minor injuries were treated according to local press.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was passed by Madrid, but was celebrated by the Catalans favouring separation, tensions remain in the independent region.
An increasing majority of electors have chosen independence, despite a low rate of participation, the opposition to the secession which has largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the Catalans from accessing the voting offices in the region.
Independent groups had campaigned on Friday night to block a demonstration of support to the national police.
It was all the same place, but it was hard to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope about the independence of Catalonia.
"We have been witnesses for the last year of a great time.
My parents would be glad to have the idea of voting, but now we are in an impasse," he lamented.
Despite their capital victory, however small, in the last December regional elections, independent Catalan parties have been in a bad mood to maintain this year's era, many popular leaders are being exiled or detained waiting to be judged to organize the referendum and declare the independence of the Catalan.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who films police support on his phone, thinks politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand, and on the other.
"The tension only makes it mount," he regretted.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison in the waiting for a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his application to the European Parliament's elections next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression caused by the Spanish Government," he added.

Livingston wins the match 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal is to win Livingston
Recently, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win at 18 matches at Steven Gerrard, the current trainer of the Ibrox Club.
Menga's goal was to make the difference and allow Gary Holt's team to place themselves in the second position of the classification, equal to Hibernian.
Gerard's men are free to win outside Premiership this season, and they have to face the Hearts team on Sunday, which runs 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet Vienna's Rapid on the occasion of the European League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it has extended its invasive course in the division, and its main trainer Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can be expected to have not lost the least meeting yet.
Livingston has missed an opportunity to face angry opponents
The Holt team would have been able to move forward well before marking, as their direct approach made the Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson tried to escape but remained focused on the opposite goal; he followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a passage of Craig Halkett's head.
Livingston's team let the Rangers own the balloon, knowing that it could generate them through working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal comes in.
The Rangers gave a frank break and Livingston tried to open up; Declan Gallagher and Robinson agreed to conquer Menga, which takes a touch and enters a goal from the ground environment.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but were faced with an impenetrable defense and Liam Kelly's goal guard was rarely concerned.
The second half is known the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos has been forced to stop Kelly.
The Ranger's Guardian Allan McGregor arrested Scott Pittman's ass while Lithgov succeeded in undoing one of Livingstone's plans.
Livingston's guard rejected all his attempts and protected his case, while two prisoners were refused by the arbitrator, one for the prosecution of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a lack of hand.
Livingston’s “Penome ” - Analysis
Lasadair Lamont from BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and future performance for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed the expectations of this climber.
Their style and team composition have not changed in practice since their return to the summit, but the merit is largely returned to Holt to have since its arrival motivated a team.
Who accounts for many big players.
The defence of Captain Halkett was great and magnificently organized, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the hall throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level with Gerard, they have not been at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last opportunity and managed to cross the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, which is found in the middle of a table.
Adopted by President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a small breakfast in Berlin in an environment.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, press freedom or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then called for Cologne to open up one of the largest museums.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many participants were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The clivage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor hosted in heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified by others.

Long Lardin Prison: 6 wounded agents at an eviction
The prison officer for high-security men reported that six prison officers had been injured at an eviction.
The event began in the HMP Long Lardin prison, located in Worcestershire, at 09:30 this Sunday, it is not always under control.
Specialized anti-emeded agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison cell.
On the ground, agents were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman from the prison director said: "The staff specially trained has been deployed to restore the order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. The officials will have to answer the police authorities and will be able to see their penalties extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country, are imprisoned in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-emeded agents were sent to prison to bring serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard bullets.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by subsidized crossings (which could be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is certainly what will happen at the beginning of the next week. The Ouragan Rosa is heading towards the desert of the south with what remains of its energy. This region could be affected by subsidized crossings.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued alerts for Monday and Tuesday to the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should direct herself on Phoenix Tuesday, with rain ads from Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the stage of tropical depression or storm in a perimeter of 300 km around Phoenix since 1950!
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) was stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the south-west desert, including the central zone of the Rocheuses and the Grand Basin, should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures that can reach 10 cm.
Rosa’s floods could be lifesaving for areas affected by drought that are not exposed to immediate severe risks.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, some 40 per cent of Arizona knew at least one extreme drought, the second worst category," reports weather.com.
Ouragan Rosa starts his way on the coast, in the Basse California Peninsula.
Every day of a great power tomorrow and a generation of winds that can reach 135 km/h, Rosa was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at the speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the coast of Mexico with the force of a hurricane Monday or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation may be massive and risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitations are expected from the Netherlands to the north-west of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," declared weather.com.
Rosa will then cross to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and the south of Utah in the evening of March.
"Torrent rains are expected in Basse-California, northwestern Sonora and in the southwestern desert and constitute the main threat," explained the National Hurricane Center.
These precipitations are believed to be based on potentially deadly rabies and debriles in the arid areas, as well as land leaks in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the murder attempt, after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The adolescent was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the morning.
He was sent to the hospital, his status is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset indicated that they arrested four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20 years old) on the night of Radstock's side.
The agents launched a call for people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the imputable and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling in Virginia-Occidental.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been victims of the evil and anger of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke yesterday in front of Congress, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations with energy and enthusiasm, who accused her of having sexually abused her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing.
The president stated on Saturday that "the American people have been witness to the intelligence and courage of Kavanaugh" this day.
"A vote within the meaning of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of participants in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks of one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight all the fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first vote on a decision to the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place on Friday, following the statement of a representative of the Republican party to CNN.
Indonesia: Seismic and Tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance doesn't stop
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people had died, most of whom had been carried away by huge waves that had fallen on the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when the beach was six meters high, and they carried many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, of a magnitude 7.5, preceded tsunami.
"When the threat of tsunami arose yesterday, the whole world was still on the beach. People didn't leave immediately, this cost their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami has not arrived alone. It has trained cars, wooden bags, housings, it has carried everything with it," explained Nugroho, explaining that the tsunami had moved at the speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by scratching trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and stores, broken and damaged bridges, as well as a pool surrounded by water.
The Replica continued to dry the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bomb left over Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have broadened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damages are considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Corps were found in the ruins of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be more important on the 300 km north of Palu, a region called Dodragea, the nearest epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications have been “completely paralysed” since Dongrya, declared Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were headed to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could well worsen," she added.
Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although agents had declared that the vagues had arrived at the time the alert was published.
A amateur video shared on social networks shows a man at the height of a frenzied building to passers in the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, bringing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general power panel that has broken all communications in Palu, so it has been difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to seek aid by aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has broken down in relief operations, but it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit Palu Sunday's evacuation centres.
Indonesia: Tsunami victims' balance is high, more than 800 deaths are reported.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision staff arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in the ruins of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of destruction, explains Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he explained.
It's a tragedy.
When the aid groups began to assist the syllables, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had no right to travel to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulation, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares it is a national disaster, international assistance can take place, but we are always waiting for it."
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday came upon Palu, the neighbors of the missing people were still waiting for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the caves.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been raised under the roof for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national team of parapet, Gendon Subbandono, had prepared two of the athletes lost for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students found themselves sleeping in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandia.
"As an elder in the discipline of the parapet, I have lived my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa hotel in the parapet community, Mr. Gindon reported that he had unexpectedly sent news of WhatsApp to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Its messages remain unresponsive.
"I think they've never received my messages."
At Newport on the Level, drivers subtilize $26,750 when recharged by an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, drivers spent $26,750 on a Brink's agent who recharged an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police service.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to eat, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leaving places, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
All persons with information about their identity are requested to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Yes
Rapper Kanye West is now calling Ye.
To announce the news on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: "It's known in the name of Kanye West. "
At 41 years of age, West, who has been called Ye for a while, used this nickname as title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for “emotional reasons”.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudo, this surname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Yes" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you", explained West earlier this year, citing the title of his album with his Big Boy guest.
“ So I am you, and I am yours.
I've been from Kanye, which means "the only", to Ye-le reflects good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album, it's a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also played on union and majuscules.
In Mexico, AMLO stated that he would never resort to military force against civilians.
The Mexican president elected Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after the bloody repression of the student forces.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco's place that "never use the military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people when student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting the young Mexican by providing monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about IA, while an official IA strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its last year's road map: it plans to become the IA innovation leader here in 2030.
"Dublining the research funds in the IA area would be a good start, because all other countries have a long lead on the United States, and we are looking for the next big discovery in IA," explains Lee.
To double the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most important companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then joined Microsoft Reasearch's management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the American government, such as the Defence Robotics Challenge Advanced Research Projects Agency, and has asked where the next competition would take place to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that suits university leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large university names to work on IA.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support the efforts of the United States in relation to IA.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to researchers in IA," he said.
The Council of State Affairs of China launched its development plan for the new generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," explained Lee.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve industry and the Academy's partners. The House-Blanche announced the formation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year for research in IA.
At the same time, the American legislation which is implementing the establishment of a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on behalf of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians heard their voice at a referendum on the change in the name of their country to the Republic of Macedonia, which would resolve an old difference for several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a right on its territory and opposes its veto at its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two Governments signed an agreement based on the new name proposed, but the opposition nationalists claimed that the change would affect the ethical identity of the Macedonian slave population, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts as to the availability of a minimum 50 per cent participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
According to the parties to the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay for bringing together organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of my country, for the Macedonian youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament stated that they would follow the vote to make it decisive.
The change in the name would require a majority of the two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, while it reached 34 per cent at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66 per cent of the voters enrolled after the election.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for a change of name, in order to open the vote on accession to NATO and the European Union, in Struca, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small scene and has seats in front of the tents installed by those who will take the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter the big door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in the Eureka integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO accession will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investment. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be favorable, as more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr Zaev after depositing his booklet.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters would have the intention of participating in the referendum, which is lower than the expected rate of participation.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated 57 per cent participation.
70 per cent of the voting participants said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent of the votes in favour are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first time the Government's policy of the West has been in force since it took power in May last year.
Decisive Action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, leaves a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the defences of Brighton in Manchester and won the 2-0 Saturday match at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at 65 minutes, seemed to be the simplest action of the world for the player.
The silver butter received the balloon in the middle of the ground, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before jumping on the ground.
Aguero was then forced by four green mails.
He was surrounded by a defender before he persuaded the others near the goal of Brighton.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to take the balloon back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trap Brighton's guard, Matthew Ryan, with a cut from the right side of the file.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to the journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance he marked at this time."
But it's Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial advantage at the first League match,
from the 29th minute.
Agarro received the balloon directly on Brighton's territory.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a few touches before she went to Sterling's second floor.
The Skyblues front sent the balloon into the wires just before moving out of the ground.
The city will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena de Sinsheim, Germany.
The player wants to play the chess game against the Rockies
The National Team was removed from the race to playoff, there was no reason to start in a new match.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of an Eliminator match for the Rockies, true legends facing the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies brought him 5-2 before the Nationals Friday evening, but they're always trying to secure their first division.
"Even though this match is not an engine, we want to dig the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level that I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launch for Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th start, will be in Thursday training and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington D.C. is 18-7 with an average score of 2,53 and 300 discounts in 220 marks and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President welcomed the situation that had generated his support in Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by referring to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
“ All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks of one of the most important elections in our life.
This is a major challenge. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I beat myself on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this awful, really horrible radical group, Democrats, you see it in action.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They depend on who they hurt, who they break to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obscenity".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before qualifying democracies of people "in anger, innuendo and lies."
He mentioned the judicial committee of the United States Senate and the democratic senator Diane Feinstein, which he was required to be elected by the public.
“Do you remember her answer? ”
Did you open the document?
Yes, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When the activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party considered to be not welcome, all because we have expressed our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received identical treatment because she was raised against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I was in disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe. Unfortunately, these are the subjects for which Jeremy himself was in conflict with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want the assembly to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the General Assemblys of Friday evening during my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party were.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many collections and the promise of shorter and more respectful policies, if it has never been taken into account for a long time.
It has become clear that the opposite opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its admissibility by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy's power took place, and the colleagues with whom I thought to share the same political vision began to expect me to return my clothes and take positions against my convictions, whether on national security or on the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abuse of social networks, calling for withdrawal, discontinuing central policies, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And that's not just my experience.
In addition, I have more chance than some of my colleagues, because the comments I received were of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a dissident of sexists or racists every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is limited to the series of defence movements and changes in the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so strong, and everything would be fine.
But this is not to do as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as an elector, because the lack of the Government of Thatcher caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the party's current officials.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the movement on Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect the homes, businesses and public services, and I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my voters whether they're workers or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of retreat or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the reasons that I defend, which are your interests to all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : The rest of the invasive
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt above: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match of the Scotch Championship of rugby at XV.
The team now occupys the top of the class and becomes the only invasive team of the champion.
Finally, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they have taken the opportunities that enabled them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can be happy with this match.
"To this day, we have been tested. But we remain in the wrong, then I must be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they have been more effective than we and have taken advantage of the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's test, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the green escape Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers. Jason Baggot used an untransformed test.
Climo has compounded the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of the time. He marked and transformed a single test to mount the score at 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose well began the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
A long wait was followed because of a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the land on a city. During the retiring, Ayr recovered the fronts with a test of Stafford McDowell transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the captain at the time of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an untransformed test by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Sruan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have tapped Climo while he had no balloon, since the touch of penalty, MacPherson touched the back of the Ayr bull, who was making progress.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the rehearsal, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth test of the team at home.
The Star of Still Game starts in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to run the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a restaurant company under license.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he wrote and joined with his long-term partner, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craigglang.
According to the official records, he is Director of Affygorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a Scottish Sun source revealed that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is with us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will turn its way towards the Pacific
Seas patrol in a boat locked in the general area of La Paz.
Public buildings burn a blue layer like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the naval bases show the following bike: "The sea comes right back to us.
The recovery is a duty.’
Throughout the blockade of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to the benefit of Chile in a conflict of resources in the 19th century is still well present. Just like the desire to sail over the Pacific Ocean, once more.
These expectations have not been so palatable for several decades. Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and seriousness, and looks forward to a positive outcome," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will make itself available for the Bolivian request. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile should negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the Bolivian Ocean.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia (who is facing a controversial battle for the re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made Monday.
"We are almost able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said late August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court is in favour of Chile, and that few things would change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The UN body based on the Netherlands was unable to grant a Chilean territory, and it had determined that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case was "not complicated", explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may even have been damaged in the last four years.
"The problem of sea access has been reversed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The beautiful rétoire of Morales knew all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but afterward it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally hasty.
Monday will provide Bolivia with “a wonderful opportunity to start a new age of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end up to 139 years of disputes with mutual advantages”, he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bequil.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must avoid the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, stated that his country did not differ from its nuclear weapons until he was confident in Washington.
Ri said on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He expressed himself at the time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on the point of relaunching a nuclear diplomacy over three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong Un, currently head of North Korea.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to think that the maintenance of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will cause the North to expand.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant advance disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang's rejection of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is the debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.

The other supersede accessories included paired pets, a shirt and even ananas. But these parts have not been imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.

The cult brand that commercializes this hard-on-portable hat that has exposed the social networks has presented another of its creations on the podium: a pile of clay sheets almost as large as the mannequin in a bathroom that carried it.
The burning orange sauce bag, arranged by rafies and a white leather doll, was the master part of the PE19 Defile La Riviera de Jacquemus during the Paris Week Fashion.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to the F.C.: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags arrive in the next summer's shops. The Creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be a demand for superior accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent review results enhanced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a school program on measures, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart. ”
This reminds us that we cannot support English in creating relations and establishing a trust link with the inhabitants of other countries.
In view of the excellent results of this year's reviews, it is noted that languages are high in classification, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
Data collected at 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest score, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied Germany, 69% of students who studied French, and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Languages as materials are now organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programmes of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 shows that among the challenges faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more language employment offers, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
No matter what career choice you choose, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with strangers will automatically place the multilingual person in front of their competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to have a conversation.
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking in several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a decent job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach important languages for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including the Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
The independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
It is clear that, at the present time, in a global commercial environment, languages remain of a capital importance for the country's future, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
You need to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The watch is almost over for fans looking for the beginnings of LeBron James in the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday, opening the pre-session against the denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell doubted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, earlier this week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-session program, which includes six matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to be ready."
Tromp campaign in Virginia-Occidental (Chaney YouTube)
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, Virginia-Occidental.
Other steps, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The vacancy confirmation vote in the Supreme Court is being reported, Trump seeks to collect support for the upcoming mid-ranch elections and to avoid that the Republicans lose control of Congress during the November vote.
What time did Trump's meeting in West Virginia take place this evening and how to look at it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, Virginia-Occidental, is scheduled for 19 a.m. (East hour) on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, directly on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the hearings of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual aggression, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be reported up to one week during the FBI investigation.
This series of meetings, however, aims first to help the Republicans to win from the country with a view to the November elections.
According to Reuters, the president of North America stated in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and stakeholders while the Republicans tried to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and in the Chamber of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is such an essential element of its programme that the President will make in the largest number of States possible at the beginning of this election campaign," said Reuters a spokesman from the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, could bring together participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media".
Saturday, this will be the second trip in a month from Trump in Virginia-Occidental, a State that won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate at the Virginia-Occidental Senate, who is on the train in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to relaunch it in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep waiting near Sunday's simples
After three simple, Saturday afternoons could well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The movement of balance of the elan is a sportive concept invented by all parts, but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as that.
So where would they put the elane now?
"They lived with six points ahead and now four, so that gives us a bit of wings," Jordan Spieth said while he repeated for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel like having some wind in their pockets and have all the reasons to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can have tried to get every three points on four.
Spieth showed a terrible effectiveness of the tea in the green and gave an example.
The energy joy crises were intensified as his game progressed. A crucial hole enabled him to equal the fourth part while Thomas and he was led down two after two holes.
His ass, because they won the match at the 15th floor, caused a similar scream, of those who tell you that he still believes the American team.
“ It really needs to be determined and focus on its game, ” said Spieth.
That's all there is to each of these players right now.
18 holes to move.
The only players to have marked more than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the history of Ryder Cup testify.
The foreign but adorable European pair has won four matches and has no right to the wrong.
Not only were "Molywood" alone not only to realize a Saturday after noon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday after noon and during the last nine Friday mornings.
This series, the way their energy seems to move between them and the crowd by deliberating them as players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who recovers a European winning potential when the sun falls on the National Golf.
In preference, the two at the same time are different.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly hit Sergio Garcia, a morning's football hero, while he was on the team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first few times sent the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never have recovered.
On the contrary, the Sunday is not there to help you.
The furballs and fursoms are so fascinating to observe because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and those they do not give, and how a strategy can be based on an eyeline.
Europe has been better equipped to date and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this forum has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubt, especially in the country.
Europe runs 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after it won 10-6 on the United States in football and Saturdays.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two winners on a Tiger Woods in distress, which enabled them to mark four points until now.
Determined to maintain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the mornings on an American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in the feed and has won two victories, but they have failed to overcome the gap.
Jim Furyk's men have to climb eight points on 12 Sundays to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to draw four points, while Molinari and him, called "Molliwood" after a fail-end, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points at their first four matches.
After breaking up Woods and Patrick Reed in the suburbs, they beat the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already disabled by 5 and 4 more categories.
Woods, who had been trained during the two Saturday matches, shined a few times, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in furballs and forzoms, and seven in affiles.
Justin Rose, well equipped for morning football, joined Henrik Stenson in the competitions, winning the victory 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, under a time of free but unscathed.
The three winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the reference to the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a victory well deserved at 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the suburbs and once again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the suburbs, who lost the first two towers.
Two times in the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a difference of four points in simple, although Furyk's team, who had the crown, had no more than a zero match to keep its trophies.
After having been second for two days, however, they may not return from an attack tomorrow.
North Korea states that disarmament cannot in “no case” be done unilaterally without confidence.
Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen its confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for its country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally in these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken the last year of "important measures of good will", such as ending nuclear and missile tests, de-commissioning nuclear testing sites and its commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he regretted
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known claims of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a “by-step” approach to the decollarization that would have been rewarded by North Korea if it had taken measures in progress, its statement revealed important that it did not reject the idea of unilateral decollarization as Pyongyang had done it in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore during the first summit between an American executive president and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working in favour of a "declaration of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected requests to impose severe international sanctions on North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea proceed first to decollarization and accentuates the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, even contrary to the "declaration of the end of war".
“ Those who think these sanctions can make us cry don’t know us.
The problem is that the maintenance of sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump in force to the United Nations by the United States leader earlier this week.
The Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, adding: "If the party concerned by the issue of decollarization was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's decollarization would not be in such a step."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of the last year, when he declared before the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was impossible to place the North Korean missiles on the North American territory after the "malefic" President Trump qualified Kim of "missile man" in a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to “completely destroy” North Korea, did not have the rate of residence this year on the courage that Kim applied for disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that the sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea would not be disarmed.
Mercredi, Trump said that no deadline had been set. "It may take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly and systematically maintained until the total, final and verifiable declaration."
Since 2006, the Security Council has strengthened unilaterally the sanctions against North Korea in order to foster the financing of the Pongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the side of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already made three trips to North Korea, but his last trip was a little disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea declared its “gaster methods”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to demilitarizing a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures”.
According to the South Korean President, Kim claims the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all students of the first cycle to sleep more and fight against the growing machinist trend that consists of studying in the use of caffeine all night.
A professor noted that most students of the world's best universities do not know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first in the United States.
It is after giving a conference on the effects of sommeil deprivation on learning that the idea has come to it.
Finally, a student approached me and said, "Why did you just tell me this last year?"
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she confided in The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits in order to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee, rice, biscuits, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sommeil on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before cooking.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the field containing interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not automatically change the behavior of students.
However, we think they have the right to know this information - the same way you have the right to know what the effects of tobacco on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride to "go through a white night" is always there, and it adds that modern technology and the pressure without this growing pressure on students is a major problem.
The fact that there is a sufficient and well-quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, depression and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight loss, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in the way of induction, making them tired permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and had forced him to insist that he was proposed to all the camps.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all students of the third cycle to follow a similar study programme before joining the institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students prepare an alarm for both the time of the rain and for the light, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circulation rate and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Menga's goal is to break Gerrard's men
The Rangers took a new tough turn outside, the attack by Dolly Menga, led by the disarmed team of Steven Gerrard in Livingston to a loss of 1-0.
Ibrox's team hoped to record his first move victory since his triumph 4--1 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team influenced Gerard's second defeat in 18 matches as an coach, leaving his team behind eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the mid-term and the Rangers team, in short inspiration, failed to balance.
While the Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingston is in third position, just behind Hibernian on the different goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the Calum Spence Arbitr who had to be cared for for for a wound to the head after an object's edge from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which led Ayr to the half-end of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, as far as he was concerned, chose the same Livi 11 which drew a point to Hearts last week and would have been thrilled to see his well-trained team exaggerate his opponents at each turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They would have to mark two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the ground environment left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then pulled a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his co-pilot, Alan Lithgow, could only reach the second power.
The Rangers managed to take control, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their game in the last three.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have been given a penalty after the French beating when Steven Lawless and he was admitted to college, but Arbitr Steven Thomson withdrew from Colombia's demands.
The Rangers had only benefited from two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's former guard, Liam Kelly, was in prison under siege by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria strike.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute is against the course of the game, there is nothing they can do but merit it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to face Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood-fried to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard responded to the mid-term by replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the alias was presented to Morelos, but the impressionant Kelly was expected to block.
Livingston has also continued to urge visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgov and Halkett playing long balls on long balls.
The Holt team would have been able to take advantage of it in the last moments, but McGregor was well trained to resist Jacobs before Lithgow left the target.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was taking Jacobs, but Thomson has again ignored him.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Count
And now, a page from our German "Sunday Morning" : 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPETUR TOURNE... was born to future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that was then born to the device known as Geiger's accountant.
Since then, the Geiger accountant has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's an accountant Geiger, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, we can actually hear the effects of the atoms released in the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "So, of course it's safe, here!"
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears its name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "distinguish" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "discover" cancer cells and kill them.
In the course of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in laboratory
They can then "discover" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they are re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Institute for Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, Her2 protein "protein causes a number of cancers to increase", including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary, and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has shown evidence in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Cooffé of a MAGA casket, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trup diaribe after passing to SNL.
That didn't happen well.
Kanye West turned up on the platform after a successful performance during which he hosted American President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would be present for the election in 2020.
After his third bite, Ghost Town, who sings by wearing a Make America Great Again casket, West took them to Democrats and returned his support to Trump.
"Well, sometimes I talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism was bothering me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL issue was launched by Matt Damon's sketch, in which the Hollywood vette collapsed from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been published, the registration of the West Diary has been related to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to fuck West with this publication.
In addition, West was complaining to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the coulsettes because of his casket.
“ They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a golf course," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the guffre?" and claims he would wear his superman hat, because no one can tell him his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted at least two people from the public and SNL members seemed exhausted, reports Variety. One on-site person said in the magazine: "A silence of death fell across the board."
West had been called to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former little friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has dissipated many people by singing I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West receives support from the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who publishes the following tweet: "In one of the most courageous minds: MERCI DEVELOPMENT OF AVOIR TITU TO THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the emission animator, questioned that West was just "faithful to himself, and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, according to me, adopts and condemns a bad ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before the issue, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known under the name of Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper brought the name Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fireman, who changed his name in symbol, then the artist was previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the watch of the Game of Thrones series, takes it to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his final sword role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the fantastic media series of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of the macho hero, asserting that this type of role on the screen often attracts young boys to take care of themselves.
In an interview given to Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something's not going to happen" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covette of Game of Thrones, also 31 years old, found that he had “firmly” to deal with this issue.
“ Personally, I think we’ve damaged masculinity. ”
"What teachings have we produced for young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that is now happening?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male personality.
He continued: “What behavior is wrong, what behavior was involved?
What does television and street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they should behave this way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
There is evidence, something that closes.”
In the interview, he also noted that he would not do any prologs or follow-up when the next summer was over, saying that he had ended with "the battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be the host of a rehearsal of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor discovered that meeting his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my precious life," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the lover of Kit's personality, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the family area of Leslie.
HIV / Sida: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China indicated a 14 per cent increase in the number of its population affected by HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Nearly 40,000 new cases have been reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the diseases have been contaminated in sexual reports, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some regions of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way has been virtually zeroed, and the Chinese health authorities have stated at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from one year to the other, the number of HIV positive people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual reports is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
In its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters claims that an employee of the GOP has disclosed data on senators, and declares "dangerous lies" and "computer theories".
Saturday, the American Republic of Maxine Waters filed allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were supported by experts and websites "of extreme right".
"Talk lies, lies, and more lies," Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It seemed that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual aggression against the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The flight occurred some time after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Water staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false. ”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these false and false allegations, is not responsible for the expulsion of such information.”
“ This false claim is completely false and a true lie. ”
Waters' statement quickly triggered online criticism, including by Ari Fleischer, the former press attack on the House-Blanche.
"This is anger," he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the necessary time to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
She doesn't have to be a provocation.
It must not be blamed for the reasons of the accused.
It must remain calm and serene. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the critics of Democrats with Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry during the Jewish hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during my-mandate elections, also took part in his reflections on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the application of the relevant laws" regarding these false claims.
"We will ensure that the couple are disarmed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English is still hit. Rowan Atkinson's Parody, sub-second spy
It has now become a tradition to search the port of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this repetition of the Johnny English action committee, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-examined in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
The ironic auto-sateter on the issue of the evidence of our insensibility is the new chance to export our country?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with his blind eyes and face in cautchouc, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating before everything that is a great chemical creation designed for a non-englophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his suspicious attempts of glamorous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspect by Mr. Bean and a good dose of the type that runs a small note in the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
In the beginning, he was also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson sometimes played in Barclaycard television advertising, now forgotten, leaving behind the chaos.
The last Johnny English has one or two sympathetic moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached an helicopter while he wore a medium armor and the rotor's balls hit his helmet quickly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is valued, although the humor is rather insufficient and extraordinary superfluous, especially at the time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission are impossible to include themselves in any confidence with the comedy.
Humanism seems to be more directed towards children than to adults and, for me, Johnny English's charms are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's film gags die in Bean's personality.
The provisional forecast of the situation is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British spy super-secret website, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great development of service agents - a low-performance role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the taste that devastates the basin for a prime minister who is a pumping person on the side of the crisis and who already suffers from a political incompatibility: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this person almost-Teresa-May, but there is no great opportunity to put himself under the stage.
His advisers in information on the fact that each active spy has been committed, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that she needs to improve Johnny English herself, who is now employed in a chic facility as a school teacher, but who is secretly giving lessons about how to become a secret agent: some nice people here, because English proposes a rock Academy experimenting academy.
English is gathered in Whitehall for a meeting of emergency information and finds Bugh, his former long-distance partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a funny hockey bat role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little gasped.
So Batman and Robin, who create great damage to His Majesty's secret services, respond to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the first minister falls dangerously under the leadership of the technological charismatic billionaire, who is said to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain: Jason Volta left, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their adgys of colorful blogs: under the shadow of servers, they set fire to an exciting French restaurant; they create chaos on Volta's villa; and English starts a real anarchy when it tries, with a virtual reality cache, to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house.
All arrests are secured for this last sequence, but in spite of all, there is nothing wrong with children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't stop thinking, like other Johnny English movies: can't the British cinema industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party has not developed a plan so that the British can work for four days but that they will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party has to consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
The party seems to want business leaders to benefit the workers of the economies generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of retirement.
This would allow employees to benefit from a three-day weekend, while still touching the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day transition was approved by the union convention as a means for workers to benefit from economic changes.
An important source within the Working Party stated to Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that will be shared with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers and with its global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was engaged in a four-day working week during its general electoral campaign of 2017.
However, this hope is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A working party spokesman stated: "A four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not considered by it."
The additional Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the last week's working conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power to the hands of "anonymous administrators" and "users" in public utility companies.
The supplementary Chancellor plans also provide that current water companies' shareholders are not able to recover the total amount of their delivery as the labour force could operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations in conduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business management councils as well as the establishment of an inclusive fund of shareholders that will pay 10 per cent of the private company's capital to employees, which will amount to up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was reported at least one week after the FBI investigation of the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's conclusions could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, chairman of the 60-minute program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out what it would like to say.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
It was resolved, determined, without fault. ”
However, Graham's vote seems to be recorded in the stone.
"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and there would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett did it in a category," Graham added, saying in a greeting to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she calls have not been able to verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t find anything new that changes. ”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star palmarism and investment in a very impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's Great Law in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise the population to the real goal of the festival, namely to end the extreme poverty of 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project extension, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), viewers should perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary, send an email to a world leader, telephone or do any other useful effort to raise awareness among the population against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still reach its goal in the remaining two years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with free concert really make it possible for them to persuade them to call for action, or is it just another example of "clicitism" - a situation in which people really think to make the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its partners, who complain for many different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to take commitments and adopt policies of more than $37 billion that should change their lives over 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and ads arising from its actions, with a discount of at least $10 billion that has already been withdrawn or raised.
The Group believes that the guarantee funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda 35 million Sterling books to end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of nutrition a footnote in history,” said the people of Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions to request the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in the framework of nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights defence movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will arrive, as we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée is one of the artists who will be performing this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could call on the Marine to create a "block" to cross Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" call the American Marine, revealed Ryan Zinke, the American Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - in particular, where it works at the request of the legitimate government - is a precedent that allows it to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the South European centre," he would have said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
"The United States, with our Marine, can ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, ban them to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is defined as the United States' energy consumer portal.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less in the operation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one cord on its arm" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to dynamizing its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia with a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do so, the representatives of the Trump administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to come out of the "unappropriate" project of the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin's "prison" city of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of loyal competition.
In a speech in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary for Energy, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, "I think we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has resulted in negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of submitting to the 2020 presidential elections, declare the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would like to present herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and for that, a woman should be at the summit," she says, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider submitting my application to the Presidents."
Warren said what he thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren showed himself frank in his criticism of Trump and the candidate at the Supreme Court of that one, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a post on Twitter, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a published survey published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not of the opinion that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58 per cent of the "probable" electors of Massachusetts said that the senator should not be present.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of democracies very much mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision here in January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's collection
Track Palin, 26 years old, has spent a year in Iraq after his appearance in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently experiencing, what he feels is coming back, I can relate to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers return to," she told the audience at the assembly for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin qualified his arrest as a "taboo subject" and declared his son and other former combatants that "they return a little different, tired, asking whether they were respected by their friends and members of the air forces, and each other military, to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman from Vasilla, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with sexual aggression and violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of an arms in the state of pregnancy.
18 Colombia and the district are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 Columbia States and districts are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new American policy that refuses asylum for victims of gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district have deposited a memorial for an asylum applicant who was responding to this policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not released.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs", had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries faced with widespread problems of gangs and related violence.
The new US asylum policy has cancelled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed immigrant immigrants to flee from joint violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney-General of the Columbia District, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy "is unaware of the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the curial friend.
Lawyers have also supported in the memory that immigration refusal policy at night to the American economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "give the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims of sexual violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political belief," said Sessions on 11 June, in its announcement of political citizenship.
"The asylum has never been designed to address all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day throughout the world."
Efforts to save Palu while the number of deaths double in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tired," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother of a family, bringing her warm little boy back to Palu in a city evacuation center.
“ At every moment, an ambulance is cancerous of the bodies.
The water itself is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting stolen goods, and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 have been submerged.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of both arms and shoulders, were placed in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to persistent repeated repetitions.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent seismicness that had removed the hotel room at the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, explaining that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" through "propagandism"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page publication on the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in an American day, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread the propaganda.
American President Donald Trump recently mentioned the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to join the US parliamentary elections on 6 November, a charge that China has rejected.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to join the American elections, Trump noted that American officials declared Reuters a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments are running for advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralleling a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese tariff measures aimed at attacking State exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Tromp Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Pekin had done harm to American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, written by Branstad in an article of opinion published in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "is in the process of doubleing its intimacy by publishing the propaganda in our own free press".
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is serving the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a taxing advertising in the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press summit, you will find little controversial voices and will not see the true reflection of the varied views that the Chinese may have on the Chinese economic trajectory, as the media strictly obey the Chinese Communist party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, not to mention any newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans align electricity with the mid-command elections due to the debulence of Kavanaugh
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual aggression, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, particularly in women, could occur during the next mid-command elections.
The feelings surrounding the case were extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly indicated that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, stated that "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he was convinced that the last minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the anger of the electors.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, the national leader and spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28th, according to Washington newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang "The November arrived!" in the Senate hall, while the Republicans ruling the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Remocratic enthusiasm and motivation will be demonstrated," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the bathrooms and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public stand, explaining in detail the allegations of sexual aggression against the appointed Supreme Court, the analysts believed that the reaction would be likely to live if the Republicans had advanced the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "It has become a confusion for the GOP".
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way the Republicans handled the situation and the way they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group helping the elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
As a result of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, however, the Americans seem divided in terms of the credibility of both parties, a small majority thinking of the latter.
A new survey of YouGov revealed that 41% of the persons interviewed had absolutely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% had declared that Kavanaugh believed absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said that Kavanaugh had probably lied or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations advanced by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after the pressure of Senator Blake.
Ford testified under oath last week to the Senate's judicial committee that she had been attacked by Kavanaugh while he was pregnant at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate to the Supreme Court would have shown him his geniuses during a party.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that seeks to revaliate with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes part in the Berners-Lee Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons authorised to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said crying that Inrupt was going to "dominate the world".
"We must do it now," he said on the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own online personal data store or DPL.
This can include contact lists, job lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The specificity of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide who can access the type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to company GDP, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a community of volunteers.
This week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and he are not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not there is a complete change where all their business models are fully framed at once.
“We do not ask them for permission. ”
In an article published on medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he has launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new age of the web," added Berners-Lee.

The only church church of the Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in its birth city 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann received this distinction on September 29, 1918, when he was attacked in Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not realize that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two small children threw out a memorial stone at a stand in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his little sons, claimed that he was "seriously symbolic" to throw out the stone 100 years after his father's operation.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battle on the Sant-Quentin channel "through a very spacious and violent broiler and under the violent shooting of camping and metallic cannons".
Later, he was quoted on the shooting line and, with the "greatest bravare", guided the line before he pulled a canon of campaign to him alone and assumed three soldiers from the detached.
On October 4, 1918, a German nobleman shot Lieutenant Vann, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his father’s actions were “a thing of the height I would never be, but that makes me humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the fall of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann expressed confidence that he felt "very honored to be part of the trial" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that many people will give to him."
The fans of mixed martial arts were awakened all night to watch Bellator 206. On the site, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent the whole night looking at a Bellator 206 well filled, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event consisted of 13 battles, six on the main board, and was broadcast directly throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face, the United Kingdom TVs were sealed when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some of us were happy to be awake until the first hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the transition to an animated design for children as “a kind of bad joke. ”
With regard to the transmission, the vice-president of the marketing and communications department at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, stated that "the government regulation provides that at 6 a.m. this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children's emissions".
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator's company, said they were going to work on their programming to include future British television viewers.
“ I think that when I think about redistribution, I think we can probably find a solution, ” Coker said.
“There is, however, six o’clock in the morning one Sunday, and we will not find a solution before Sunday or Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program crashed, there were many messages in both terms and they were not all friends.
We're trying to fix, we think it was a technical problem.
But this was not a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We'll be limited to five battles instead of six -- as we do usual -- and we've tried to give more for the fans and we've got all lost.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" on the level of sexuality
Olympical lunger Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to secondary school but "the whole world wasn't like me."
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presentation by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of gay rights to give others the "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual emission presenter, Kirsty Young, took a leave of several months because of his illness.
As a ship wrecked in Laverne's first show, Daley believed that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He stated: “Even today, these feelings of inferiority and differentness are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary to succeed.”
In order not to discover the whole world when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The Olympic bronze medal is now a renowned LGBT soldier and has benefited from his participation this year in the Games of Commonwealth in Australia in order to demand a larger number of countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without rehabilitating and that he wanted to return “hope” to others.
The triple champion of the world claimed that he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - American movieist Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old widow last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we live so many things at such a young age," - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he was confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who knew the same height and bottom.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspectives" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I didn't think it was a gold medal," he explained.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley was convinced that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be seated in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, "Dad, you won't be there to be in the first rank," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he was dead so that I could admit that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all that I had dreamed of all my life - dancing in front of a crowd at the Olympics, there was nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired him to have his first choice of song - Heather Small's Doud - who accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the flesh of the chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11 a.m. 15 p.m.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup Saturday bank
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to go back to avoid this sad step.
Mickelson, who participated in the bi-annual competition for the second time, a record, was separated by Captain Jim Furyk of the Forewords and Saturdays.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the fifth major champion shared his day between the role of support and the persistence of his game in order to heal his wounds.
He has never been the largest manor, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long round systematically imposes the double cuts.
And as if the race wasn't so dramatic in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday match, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who made this week's team with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, at the beginning of the 12 simple games, take a good start, the Mickelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a double tap, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
“ He has great confidence in him.
It's a legendary champion and it's added both things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I expected more, but it's like what happened and it's like what we're supposed to do.
He wants to be there, like all the others.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup which has never actually reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 missing and seven demos, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's sad, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to smile people, and it's kind of awesome to have in the team room," he explained.
“ I think younger players had the pleasure of meeting him this week, which was fun to see.
It does more than play. ”
The captain of the European election Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a non-reliable advance before the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a criminal course.
The Danois argued his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally took the lead in the classification with the smallest possible deviation on the line of arrival, importing 1411⁄2-131/2.2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we went to Valderrama widely; we had a big advance in Brooklyn, where we failed, and Valderrama, where we won, but in justice," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Classion to win the winner 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the Golf National to go 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Get him to the bottom tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever you need.
It's not over before we have the points on the table.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophie, and above all, we must remain focused.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other hand - these are the world's best players."
Ravi of the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's all the other pair of bugs.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented and will go anywhere else.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're alone, you're tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message to pass to players, it's to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he has to go get the best of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart, Jim Furyk, will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points on four.
Furyk himself knew the two extremes of these revolutions on the last day, after he became part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing out on the "Miracle de Médinah", where Europe won the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had made his players jump the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this start as soon as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, makes a lot of pressure on the games in the environment.
We set up our training accordingly and put the boys as we think we should do, we try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has seen the task of taking the attack and facing Rory McIlroy in the first grade hole, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the class.
"I have joined this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said on his simple selection.
The new German warship still reported
According to local media, the new flagship of the German Navy should have been used in 2014 to replace the ageing warships from the cold war, but it will not be in service until the next year due to inadequate systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all the new Bade-Wurtemberg frigates, was reported in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Marine in 2014, but the concerns encountered after delivery have compromised the purpose of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Wurtemberg-class ships that the Marine has ordered in 2007 will replace the old-age frigates of the Bréme class.
It is certain that they will have a powerful cannon, a range of ancient and anti-ships missiles, as well as some profitable technologies, such as a radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent brakes for a period of up to two years outside the port of approach.
According to Die Zeit, however, the intense delays mean that the pre-war-gardis ships - which should allow Germany to design its own forces - will already be obsolete when they are in service.
Last year, the F125 deadly frigate made major headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in service and sent it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Marine returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery.
The reasons for this return were unknown, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and material defects" that made the warship useless in case of deployment in combat missions.
The software shortcomings were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 marines, which corresponds to half of the old crews of Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it seems that the ship is significantly loaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Marine to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7 000-tonnes Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the shortcomings of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole, including training of the crew, is also a problem.
It was said that it reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion at the start.
The problems related to new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent alerts, which reduce Germany's shipping force.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, recognized earlier this year that the Marine is indeed "short-range ships capable of detonating".
The manager stated that the situation had had a bad effect of snow with time, since the old vessels had been detonated but no replacement ship had been designated.
He regretted that none of his classmates in the Bade-Wortemberg class had been able to join the Marine.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of the keys
New research carried out in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how the wise keys use the landscape in their food demand.
It is hoped that observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and sopranos pipelines as well as long-eared brown keys and Daubenton in the Inverwe garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property in order to monitor the activities of sound keys throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound will enable you to determine the frequency of key crises as well as the activities of different species.
A map and a report on the habitat will be drawn up to draw up a detailed table of their behaviour at the territory level.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for raw materials and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management activities such as the creation of pests and the best way to preserve forests for droughts and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the number of key populations has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the soils and leads to their loss of habitat.
Eolianes and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as soft paper and some chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks on company catasts.
Sour keys aren't really smart.
However, given their nightly habit of hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS is responsible for the protection of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections on the soil and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scotland's soybean keys on the Thureve site in Dumfries-and-Gallway, which opens eight of the ten species of Scotland's sourbes.
David Thompson, Field Manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrive, we have an ideal place for shoes," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about the noise keys, although the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what the noise keys need to improve.”
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of key-sudreys before the maintenance of the property, because by destroying it without wanting it to be a single birth, it can cause the death of 400 women and children, or the disappearance of a local population.
Soursy keys are protected and it is illegal to kill them, destroy them, or destroy their prey.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Ecosage Officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide his assistance.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our keys and about many of our species, we don’t know what is happening in their populations for the moment.”
Ronaldo refutes the charges of violence while his lawyers prepare to continue a German magazine in justice
Cristian Ronaldo described the charges of violence against him as “misleading information, ” claiming that people “want to know one another ” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and the Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid $375,000 to keep her silent on this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
With her 142 million fans in a video published directly on Instagram, a few hours after the release of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has qualified for this information of "false information".
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera the fifth laureate of the Ballon d'Or.
“ They want to make themselves out of the pub using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are willing to continue with Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have qualified as "inadmissible statement of suspicion in the field of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for “moral damages of a proportion of the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a follow-up of the Palms casino hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night box, Ronaldo and Maorga were apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal violence would have occurred, according to documents deposited at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was injured after the alleged incident and made sure that he was a "good-bye" to "99%" but that he did not know what was happening with the "1%" remaining.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that they agreed.
Mayorga also claimed to have returned to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly regulation because she felt "destroyed by officials" and was afraid of "a public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to annul this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer, he joined the Italian Giant Juve in a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the U.S. Secretary of State responsible for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had lost its status as world car construction leader after Brexit.
He added that he was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in his office in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Auris and Avenis de Toyota vehicles - has built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which have been exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British motorists, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreeing on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concern is that car manufacturers qualify for the supply chain in Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is operated in "tend-flow" of parts every 37 minutes of UK and EU suppliers for vehicles manufactured on-board.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom left the EU unconstitutional, there might be border disturbances that, according to the industry, could result in delays and cuts in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have the inventory for more than one day at his Derbyshire factory, declared the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to benefit from the current success but also to take this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today issue.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other builders, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has become a great set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to determine how long the production would have been stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and would end the cost of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the United Union trade union coordinator who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "I think, once these jobs disappear, they never come back."
A government spokesman stated: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The House-Blanche announces that the assembly of Trump and Rosenstein could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and General Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "repatriated for a week", while the fight for candidate to the Supreme Court is ongoing.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's work, the Special Adviser to Investigate Russian Entrance in Elections, the links between Trump's and Russia's collaborators and the possible obstacles to justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether Trump will return or not to the Assistant Attorney General, and therefore endanger Mueller's independence, feeding the Roma in Washington for months.
More recently this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken to bring a micro to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein didn't make those statements.
However, last Monday he presented himself to the House-Blanche, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then to the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump stated that he "would not" refer to Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was reported to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's judicial commission which witnessed Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week's investigation on complaints against Kavanaugh, still delaying the Senate vote.
Sunday, Trump's press attack, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if one week's rest is still given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to have the press in the current."
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the House-Blanche.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to an avversion for the "demagogical" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they are spreading the gallery."
Later, she learned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-responsibility sessions than any other President before him": "We checked the figures."
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it in the last few weeks, and this will take place at a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences alone.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a contraction and at times a strange appearance before the journalists gathered.
With regard to fear of Brexit, the Secretary for Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and to wish them to remain behind Brexit.
The Scottish parliamentary Jeane Freeman sent a letter within a period of less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of state applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations on retirement have continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should result in decisions on this automatic basis.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very stressful for each of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate to what extent I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
The Scotland is all your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After a headache, Christion Abercrombie undergos an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the second of the Tigers of Tennessee, was an emergency after a head injury on Saturday in the absence of Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the trainer in the state of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before the middle of the day.
"He arrived on the touch line and went out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen in Abercrombie on the line of touch before placing it on a civilian and carrying it over to another examination.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was from the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris explained that there was no "expressions on the type or extent of injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury was caused.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five seizures on the weekend before leaving the match, which led to his total of the season to 18 seizures.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp rights if they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the additional money will be used to help the homeless in the framework of the new conservative regimes.
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the right to strike will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury is expected to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the additional money will help the unopened, announce Theresa May today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target people with high income.
The increase in the right to strike will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen the government's efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which has now been added to the right of current stamps, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on secondary residences and purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year.
About 13 per cent of the new London buildings are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which reduces prices and prevents primers from taking place on the housing market.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in capital - have become 'fathom cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers living most of the time outside the country.
This new policy is going on a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the law of smoking in order to help young people acquire a first house.
In accusing large construction companies of maintaining property prices at a high level by catching land without using them, he invited Ms. May to withdraw quotas on affordable housing in order to regulate the "immotive disparity" that was saved in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented a series of exciting proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of housing and the removal of "non-failure".
He also wanted to give the councils more extensive powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I declared that I would devote my position as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do so, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to all who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is also unjust for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house and for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become distant and the misery of the non-abri remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the eco-selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Ecossais is pleased to highlight the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East Club, which currently occupys the third place of League 1 to three points of leadership.
He ran the Stadium of Light this summer after he left St Mirren in Premier League the last season.
“ I had to play for my country as a player.
I've been selected for Division B and that's all," Ross said at the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's matches in Hampden with my father and it's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would be only if I succeeded in managing the club.”
The presidents of Ross as the electors of Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technique of Alloa Athletic states that he did not hesitate to rank behind such emblematic names in such a large club, which has already delineated the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I remember this club in First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not think of me as a success here except if I can get rid of the club there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period of time as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 months in the heart trainer.
He then helped Alloa to remount a delegation in the third division and transformed St. Mirren, who was on the board, into a major winner of the campaign next season.
Ross now speaks more easily than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
The arrest of Alloa "was no doubt a real carrefour", he recalls.
"I really found that being an coach was better for me than playing.
This seems strange because I'm well out of my life, that I won my life well, and that I've benefited from some of the prizes.

The summer canyon has raised British pubs' income in difficulty, but it has given rise to pressure on restaurant channels.
The figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7% in their sales in July, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA Board, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent isolation and long-term participation from England to the World Cup made it possible to follow the model of the month of June, where the bars knew an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had even more important shock.
The reduction of 1.8 % registered in June in the restoration sector has only been completed in July.
The pubs and bars where alcohol is served are far from the most popular, with more similar points than the restaurants that fall.
Food pubs have also suffered the effects of the sun, but not as much as restorers.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and get a glass.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst for leisure and the RSM hotel, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
Meteo and the impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors with regard to sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, which is a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum, especially painful, in addition to constant cost pressures.
The long and hot weather could not have been less suitable for the food sector operators and the time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we knew in August will provide us with a well deserved review.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowdown in implementation.
The sales of the industry are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion Sterling books and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, a five-year-old has secret accounts that he hides from his parents.
According to a survey, a five-year-old - some 11-year-old - has secret accounts on social media that he hides to his parents and teachers.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a "primary" account to show them to their parents
A five-year-old - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens an account on the social media he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed rapid growth in the "insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20 per cent of the students said to manage a net "main" account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A 13 - year - old girl who fell down by gambling on the secret site of her 13 - year - old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “stumble me. ”
According to a study conducted by Digital Awarenss UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of those who recognize their private accounts.
The head of CSM Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many young people are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers do not find them."
Elidh Doyle will represent the athletes to the Scottish Athletics Board of Administration.
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Governing Council of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual General Assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most exotic athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive experience gained at international level these ten years.
"Eilid is receiving immense respect within the British and World Athletic Community and we are sure that Scotland's Athletics would benefit greatly from its participation in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and lead this sport in Scotland."

Online, a publication on the street that compares mothers and cows divide views
An online advertising of a company offering a withdrawal may compare mothers who give birth to cows when they are treated.
In order to mark the launch of what is known as "first silenced shots in the world", Elvie, a large public technology company, launched an avid advertising inspired by a music videoclip to show the freedom that her new shots offer to attractive women.
In a garden of cows filled with mud, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song where the words are: "Yes, I bring myself, but you don't see any noise" and "In case you wouldn't notice it, it's my heart, not my mothers."
The refrin continues: "I pump him, pump him, I feed the babies, pump him, pump him, pump him, I help women bring milk."
However, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to online policing.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many say it sheds light on the "hours" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must fall pregnant and give birth to the milk, except their babies are taken away in the days that follow their birth," wrote one of them.
Elvie's drawn-out adapts discretionally in an allegation support (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's an understandable trauma to mother and baby.
But why don't you use them to make a joke for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone added: "A advertising so disconnected."
Others have defended advertising, for example, by acknowledging that she had found the song "hilarant".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I'd have bought one if I was still on the run.
Pomper gave me the impression of being empty.
Advertisement is a bit of a dengue, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's an amusing publication for mothers who take their milk (often on their place of work or toilets) and feel like "waks".
This is not a advertising that leaves the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women appear to have been dancing with the flash-light discrets dissimulated in their support.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the drawback say they have the impression of being empty.
However, Elvie's drawing is completely silent, without children or toilets, and is discreetly inserted into a marriage support, which gives women the freedom to move, to have their babies, and even to go out with their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and DPE at Mother, commented: "The Elvie drawing is such a revolutionary product that it deserves an audacity and provocation.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and breast-feeding cows, we wanted to highlight the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in an interesting and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new baby will seek.
That's not the first time Elvie's shooting's done one of the newspapers.
During the week of fashion in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of the design of Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants were placed in silence in a camp outside Texas.
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, although the number of monthly crossings at the borders remains relatively stable, partly because of the fact that Trup’s talks and strict administration policies have been able to complement children’s placements among respondents.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were themselves immigrants without paper and were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by taking up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members should submit their digital inputs and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested tens of people who had applied for parenting of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had no judicial precedents.
" Nearly 80% of the people who are respondents or members of their families are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to follow these people," said Albence.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to address the case of children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that would force some of them to compare before the court in the month following their detention rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be compared by videoconference rather than by person to appeal for their legal status before a judge of immigration.
Unelected persons will soon be expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports that have been submitted in recent months by the refugee network, more children remain in detention, more likely to become angry or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large establishment such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of his size, according to the child's rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to tell their friends about it could increase a trauma that many have to deal with.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw from it.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to them, even if the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-president, said that foreign forces were on the Syrian soil illegally, in the hope of combating terrorism, and that they would "be treated as a consequence".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem supported that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to carry on this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” both of both terrorist groups and of any “illegal foreign presence”.
The United States accounts for some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war - torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moulalem said that the conditions were favourable to the refugees, and accused "some Western countries" of "producing irrational concerns" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are in the process of policying what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have stated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as long as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the establishment of a buffer zone in the last strong rebellion of Idlib allowed for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turk Agreement has avoided a large-scale invasion of the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moulalem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that military measures would target the dissidents, particularly the fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who will be "removed".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee gathering members of the Government and opposition in order to prepare a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moulalem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to “the revision of the articles of the current constitution”, and formulated a reservation against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Command
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be realized in 2020 unless, as many liberal TV viewers undoubtedly expect, the destruction and scandal led him to leave his presidency early.
What would certainly be the most spectacular end of a presidency!
At this point, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the time-to-point rates have doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNNs, and have practically tripled, with 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million TV viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC, which reaches 3.5 million TV viewers at large evenings, is the first cable TV channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, a representative of the ABC's drama series "Designed Survivor", which speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Chapter.
In Scovell, a famous comical audience and viewer of "Just the Funny Parts: And some incredible truths about moving into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory for her.
She recalls having taken a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask you?
"He answered, 'Because he made me laugh,' said Mrs. Skovell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, contrary to what is happening on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe c. Wade case if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the luckiest viewers can afford.
However, this goes beyond being a informed citizen when we look back at six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on the clothing in the care suit of $15,000 by Paul Manafort (“a full of pride” according to Washington Post) and the consequences of extraordinary descriptions that Stormy Daniels gave of, uh, the Anatomy of Mr. Trump.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"If a part of what he does gives the impression of seeing a TV show, it's because he makes you appreciate something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", regarding the changing teams and the daily return of Trump (to fight with NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees in his home on the north River of Kauai, but he was going inside to look at MSNBC while registering CNN.
He could not get away with Brett Kavanaugh, who was prepared to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the game.
"I remember the time when we were enthralled by all these crazy emissions and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," I was entrusted with Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money enquiries the most sealed mid-command elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is inundated with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the Congress's subscriptions, which allowed two holders to discuss the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has broken his seat in another circuit during the recent special elections.
Lamb stands for another title, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which runs strongly the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old rounds were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17th district course has resulted in an outbreak of the financing of electoral campaigns between the major funding branches of the parties, the Congress Committee on the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice in last March at a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States planned to penalize Salvador for its support in China, then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Pekin, which was little opposed to Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the direction of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the Department of State decided to call the heads of the American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Department at the beginning of a month's communication.
However, sanctions have been imposed only against Salvador, which received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017, in particular to control drug users and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on an analogue meeting held last year, perceived as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from returning to the United States.
However, in September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the Conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
The eight Vice-President Mike Pence now expressed himself at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to show the importance of the administration of the meeting, to inform diplomats.
And the three American emissaries are peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishments on the part of Washington.
A spokesman from Mr. Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of anonymat.
Their proposals were co-sponsored by an independent analyst close to the administration, who has also remained anonymous.
Consult History
The next shooting could be the report of Special Advocate Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now based on substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also lead his investigation into the question of a connivance of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be required to report to this body at a time when he is about to appear before the electors and perhaps a jury composed of his peers.
There are many 'yes', and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - neither his approvals in Europe.
We all have decisions to take on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officials were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and repatriated the Czech Republic in Munich.
We have failed, and there is no chance to avoid the years of pregnancy that have followed.
The course of history revolves around these dwellings and the inexhaustible course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently faced with a number of these challenges.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the assistant to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to register the president in secret and issued hypotheses on his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said the timing report was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the investigation recently requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exaggerating or impartial - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of the allegations of sexual assault and unjust testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for a Congress that will ask for accounts to Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be a long winter.
But I'm convinced we didn't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who had previously taken over my residence as a ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, six years later, sent me to lighten the sands of the Sabbath on the swastika table.
With this heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, confident in the face of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that victory against Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the European Union.
A gene injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of his first participation in the season until the match zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but it is believed that Rangers are able to take the best of such a result to perform exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, as Villarreal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
"We're in the game thinking of getting something and we're split up with a point.
We may have been able to bring it to an end, but in the whole, a match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better than the first half and we returned to the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday, this is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can expect three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have made a good outcome during their last match, although I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the people behind us.
The last year has been very difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfactory factor about this place right now.
The team is good and the boys show up very much; training is quality.
We hope we can go ahead now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear about their savings
Even though participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be treated, few people raised the issue with their families.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't make it necessary to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Health Agency.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, because these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your advisor is also able to help you set up a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your estate - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the passage.
Provide a health care search that will allow you to identify a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider also a search for your financial resources.
You choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and he comes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please enter these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There is only money that is in play, but also who are doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place. ”

The victim, aged forty years, was in the region of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was taken into the chest, belly, and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place at 2 p.m. 30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see his rapist.
His injuries do not threaten his life, and the police have launched a call to witness.
Seismes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that destroyed the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance should be lifted.
The communications are paralyzed, the relief services have not been able to receive any information from the Dondhia Regency, a region located in the north of Palu, which is closer to the center of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
A few important facts about Palu and Dodhia, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the point of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawasi, where the population was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was its 40th anniversary when the seismic and tsunami took place.
Dondrea is a kingdom that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) from coast to the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the Regency was estimated to be a administrative region located below one province, to 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, and particularly of the coastal region of Dodrea.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morovali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhra have been affected by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Dodrea.
A tsunami also struck the west of Dondria in 1996, bringing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Sismical Fire Circle and is regularly dried by seismos.
Here are some of the main seismic and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, set off a tsunami that had erupted in 14 countries, bringing 226 000 victims to the Indian Ocean, including more than half of the people in Aceh.
2005: Several violent seisms have taken the west coast of Sumatra from the end of March to the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude of 6.8 reached the south of Java, Indonesia's most common island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude seismo has taken over the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake destroyed one of the islands of Mentawai, along the coast of Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial seism has removed the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the destruction caused by the 2004 deadly seism and tsunami.
No tsunami has been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the flood of furniture.
2018: Important seisms have taken over the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly from the north side of the island.
The seism destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily blocked tourists.
Sarah Palin's adopted son is arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, aged 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was interviewed for alleged marital violence, contrary to a signal of marital violence and resistance to arrest, to the words of a communication published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a woman's sex knowledge who tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in temporary detention in Mat-Su's temporary detention centre and is detained without guarantee of $500, KTUU said.
He compared himself to the Swedish court, saying "not guilty, it's safe" when his complainant was asked, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to a prison sentence that could go up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor category B offence, sentenced to a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of marital violence, of violence in the report of a joint violence crime and of possession of an arms in the state of emergency in connection with the incident.
His partner had claimed he had shot him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by Veterans groups in 2016 after they linked the violent behavior of his son and the PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Seismo in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people were killed following the seismic occupation of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude seism of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are in progress and the balance of the victims should be high in the coming days.
The seisma was declared right across the center of Sulawesi, in the north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Video broadcasts on social media show the impact point.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors ask for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, New York's assassin who has made eight victims - a rare punishment that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would be used by a truck rented by Home Depot to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan on its road and a cycler in October last.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and infected "intendedly" of serious physical damage, according to the statement of intention to apply for capital punishment deposited with the South New York District.
These two charges are likely to lead to the death penalty, according to the legal document.
A few weeks after this attack, a large federal court sentenced Saipov to 22 chief charges, including eight charges of killing for fund-raising, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a minute preparation and a premeditation", said the prosecutors, according to the method used by Saipov to "hate, cruel and abusive".
"Sayfulo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco", states the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were silver tourists.
New York's South District had not claimed death penalty in the context of prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a new Yorkese federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed to be delivered to the RSS during the two years that followed the cold war.
The two Rosenberg were executed by electric chassis on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of reservations in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial records.
According to the police, he indicated to the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been motivated to wait after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment act.
He also asked to show Daesh's staff in his hospital room, the police explained.
He appealed to the 22 chiefs of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that he was clearly disappointed in the decision to try to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept his appeal for guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the traumatism associated with these events for all interested people," said Patton.
The Saipov defence team had already asked the prosecutors not to complain about the death penalty.
A conservative member claims that NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilise the popular army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former U.S. Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - as one of those Members of Theresa May suggested, should be involved in negotiating with the EU.
In the course of Birmingham, the Conservative Member of the Ban Peter Bone stated that the United Kingdom "would have been released" if Mr. Farage had been a secretary in Brexit.
But the dilemma faced by Ms. May to reconcile her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union who joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has a bad idea of keeping his schedule of Chequers' compromises despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The alliances stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone pointed out at the Leaves Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He believed that Mr Farage should have become a partner and should be entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would already be out," he said.
Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We are not delivered to world wars to submit.
We want to make our own legislation in our own home."
Mr. Bone separated the suggestions that the public opinion had developed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely false."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, favouring the exit, was also present at the march to tell journalists: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The opposition will not be appreciated by the general public, it is also the case of our party and our militants who silence the streets and make us elected first of all.
Leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a message directed to Ms. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises.”
" Mr. Farage pointed out to the assembly that politicians should be willing to "sent the pressure" if they were on the point of disregarding the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
"It is now a matter of confidence between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They tried to fool Brexit, and today we say to them, "We will not let you go out of it."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is on the point of betraying Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, the pro-European adapters went through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of militants have branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
His work-lister, Lord Adonis, was moved by conservatives because of security issues regarding the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are those who ensure that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all technology for Canada, more, for the free border, for the free trade-free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real thing.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the presidential elections
Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Moscow Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.

The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors in the framework of a public assembly since the function of Trump.
A participant asked whether she intended to present herself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman in the head of the state."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton leads to the world title after his team's leadership has enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified as Lewis Hamilton took the last Saturday to play an important role in the competition.
From the field position, Bottas took a good start and admired Hamilton on the side while he defended his place in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the first stations and left Hamilton to launch in the tournament at the poloton cave, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through a later tour and found behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage of a wheel-to-wheel operation that saw Ferrari's pilot leave the inner part at risk of resisting after a double defence attempt in the third round.
Max Verstappen was part of the last line of the grid and was seven at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21-year-old.
He then dominated a large part of the course while now his penises to see a fast arrival and to advance Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth place.
It finally arrived in the stands at the 44th round, but it was not able to speed up the pace in the remaining eight rounds, Raikkonen was ranked fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri has done a great job every weekend and has been a real gentleman who has let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language.
During a last Saturday meeting, President Donald Trump broke up with Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not released Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in Virginia-Occidental, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission, but said that the events in the Senate showed that people were “bad, abusive and dishonest”.
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that would happen these last days in the Senate, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry and angry and mean and mean and dishonest," he said.
"Seeing the disclosures and escapes, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose information?
Remember his answer... did you publish information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have published information... No, we have not published information," he added, thinking about the impression of the senator.
Feinstein received in July last ford a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early September, but Feinstein did not want the escape from his office.
"I have not broken Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not disclosed his story," said Feinstein to the committee, saying The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his denial does not seem to have been well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the meeting: "I'm telling you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President had heard that Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see evil, mechanism, they're trying to know who hurt them, who have to break up to gain power and control," said the president of the Mediaite.

An air traffic controller was killed by hundreds of people on board a plane to escape from the seismo.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is greeted in heroes after his death by ensuring that a ship carrying hundreds of people can safely land.
More than 800 people were killed and many others were killed after an important seismic attack on the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong responders continue to tear down the region, and a large number of people are thrown down in the city of Palu.
But despite the departure of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position in the violent tour of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It is located to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at the moment, can be safely decoyed.
Then he came out of the control tower when he heard she was going to fall.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, the airport of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands, the disaster prevention agency of the country, indicating that access to the cities of Dodrya, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The balance would continue to grow because many bodies were still under the clouds and a large number could not be saved," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, agency spokesman
Vagues measuring up to six meters have excavated Palu that will celebrate a mass funeral tomorrow.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and livelihoods.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, a cancer cancer of the bodies.
The water itself is rare.
The mini-markets are packed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we are unaware of what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could stop.”
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived at Palu Sunday and addressed the military in the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was kidnapped earlier this year by seismics in Lombok, who have killed more than 550 people.
A plane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in the chain.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Gulf of the Pacific in Micronesia now claims that a man was being taken away after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the aircraft that was flying.
Air Niugini stated in a communiqué that since after Saturday after noon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the person concerned.
The airline has not responded immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships have participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft has crossed the water by attempting to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were always in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact execution of the events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Marine reported that the aircraft had landed in the chain near the landing track.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others could have flown into the water until the aid issues of the aircraft were running.
He claimed that the officers were panicked and raised, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that the mariners who worked near the improvement of a ship had also participated in rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the farm before the plane crashed about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them were affected by Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night where the woman was burned alive
The charge was updated during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described how he used telephone calls from a laptop to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night when he died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained the location data from several portable phones that indicated that Tellis and was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, related The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers while he was pretending to meet his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford compared to the Saturday bar and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he had declared himself in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he “was thinking, because my truck was in Nashville”.
Another inconsistencies lie in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The telephone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence must start its appeal tomorrow.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.

Another Black?!
A New York bride continues a couple in justice for licensed after a "racist" text
New York's bride continued a court case for discriminatory licensing after she received an error message from the mother who complained that she was "another Black".
The couple refuse to be racist, and imitate the persecutions of a "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed surprise in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new one, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIRE”, wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a SMS.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her away twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after he understood his gag, "slow at ease", Plato-Flaxman referred to Ms. Maurice, explaining to him that their former young brother, Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting more than a Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent to her by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues to be a legal partner in order to obtain compensation for her resignation and claims a monthly compensation of $350 per day for the service at home for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do this kind of stuff," she explained at Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be able to trust him after he had suffered the torture.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco in Post.
"But do you trust your children to someone with whom you have been implicated, even if it was a mistake?
Your new one?
Come on!’
Similar to a "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife had only two months to have a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you continue with someone like this?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still under way, the Court of Public Opinion is not reluctant to condemn the couple on the social media, beatings for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves at a time when they spoke, opening a new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: “It’s hard to put herself in the place of someone who beat him for the first time before his publication.
It's very interesting, knowing what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a little hours in the mud, would be optimistic about her job. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books had a "twenty-affiliated" life after her death last year.
She described Paddington as a “very important member of our family”, adding that her father was very proud of her final success.
"It was a very calm man, and it wasn't a pretender," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we're proud of him, even though it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
On his arrival, his daughter had been rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nothing regularly appealed to explain how bad the situation was, we do not expect it to happen," commented Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then, Nad called me to warn me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain the cardiac rhythm were being slowly exacerbated and released from his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all about to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to have the cup."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, in the grief of her daughter, rides in the plane with other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one was in the current," she said.
"I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight I've experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women suffer from postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide strive to prevent others from getting married.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys showed, on a gallous bridge, e-mail cards showing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
The son of Ms. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and died at the age of 18.
"I do not want any parent to feel what I am forced to feel daily," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying in Lydney, said his son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“ Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile was shining in any part of it."
However, he quit his job before he died, since he was “in a very dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he had been murdered.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can see and who you can talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep quiet - you have to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt tired, depressed or else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything.”
She pointed out that her death had represented a tremendous traumatism for them, but they had to go out: "It's disgusting for the family.
It's ruining us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh played when the FBI began to investigate.
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we might bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would not "float down" in a partian audience.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican parties not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the choice of the moment.
The elections will only take place in five weeks, or on 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously discouraged in their attempts to make the person they want the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through his intermediate, his wife, Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats present.
We still do not know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters "fall" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's accession to power seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of the Southern Union, said 1,127 deserts had taken place last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger charges were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North-West Deserters will finally be able to grant South-Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have broken the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them were China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized area (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and refugees often forced.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
More recently this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the framework of maintenance focused on the negotiations on decollarization that remained until then.
This happened after the historic June meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in large lines, to work in favour of a Dutch Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, has imposed US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to engage in unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and claims that it is inappropriate to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh of "histique", and declared that it was inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments in a interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have treated her "historic", said Pelosi about her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh to the Senate Committee of the Last Jewish Court.
Kavanaugh launched, with emotion, the allegations that he would have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very emotional and sometimes failed to cry and excited by mentioning his family and years of college.
He also explicitly condemned the democracies sitting on the committee, qualifying the allegations of "gross and coordinated murder" organized by liberals that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he is discrepancies himself with these statements and the way he has taken up with Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked if she would try to destroy Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and if the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also inappropriate to sit in the court where he is currently found," said Pelosi.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also added that as a democracy, she was concerned about any decisions made by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During his hearings of confirmation of the charges, Mr. Kavanaugh chose the question of possible reverse of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and wait for what we say: "It's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diaribe, months and years of anger, and it can't make it out without crying.
"We will cry when we do," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was a part of the frame, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and cried: "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry.”
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed to express anger, in part because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in a office dominated by men, where I was a day when I was found mourning of an unexpressable root, was that I had been caught by the skin of an old woman - a cold guide that had always been a little terrified - who trained me in a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe you are sad and disappointed because they have been with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been arrested on board a ship called Monkey Business and had been removed from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of herself presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a mindful decision," she confided, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing he missed was a more person.
Someone had called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in the fund-raising, and therefore he swore that it would not participate less than $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her partners, who usually gave $1,000 to men, were expected to pay her $250.
"Do they think I have the right to a rapist?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was troubled by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult for the collection of funds and the target of voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sex - that she felt shock.
"You think I was having a nervous depression," recalled Ms. Schroeder about the press reaction to her.
“ You think Kleineex was my sponsor.
I remember being asked what they were gonna put on my tomb stone.
"She's crying"?
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit in Beijing
The first savings of the US-China trade war have been overwhelming, and while the battle is far from over, a long-term dispute between countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
American President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase took place this week with new customs duties affecting articles of US$ 200 billion (150 billion) and taxing half of all goods from China coming to the United States.
Each time, Pekin recovered in nature, recently breaking the customs duties of 5 to 10 per cent from $60 billion in US dollars.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will be empty.
If Washington were to surrender, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be too burdensome for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts believe, however, that if Pekin can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can impose conditions that are conducive to economic slowdown in one or more countries is much more dangerous than the observers have recognized in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, to the Central for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild this devastated country through a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Turning to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have destroyed the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the reconstruction of this desolate country.
He pointed out, however, that he would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that would bring the resurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 by hitting the United States team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on the European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team opened the barrier to 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, highlighted his departure from the water at 16th in par-3, passing his due to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari chose in all rounds, becoming one of the four players to have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition goes back in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated from 5-4 by the most well placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, turned 2 and 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Cups Ryder, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the champion of Europe all the time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than I do.
It was a year of movement.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to be able to help it," said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
It passes the flame to its companion John Ram who won the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride, having fought Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup career.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, which has uncovered 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a bad weekend to find the fairies, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the high-level golf all the time of the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk commented after a decade's performance on his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're beat.
This morning, we had some time when we put pressure on Europe.
We've left.
I got Thomas's hat.
It's a big captain.
His 12 players were all very good.
We're going to join us, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
He needs to get in line.
We're going to get over it."
