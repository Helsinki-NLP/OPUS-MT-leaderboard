Photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice during the summer year, and the snow is snowy.
For more than 40 years, a woman who has been trading in the city centre will be rewarded with a private reception of the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, selling ice cream and cheese on the "Dinky Donuts" street of Bedford Midland Road, together with the family, was invited to buy lunch.
Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition on the Internet in order to receive or receive recognition.
Mr. Adnissant said she was honored to pursue such a career.
According to Medford's mayor Dave's Hodgson, the children and children were invited to his office to look at the city's rules and historical artifacts and to dig up the carpet.
"Lina Bedforfe takes a special place and her kitchen is part of the city centre," he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
Mr. Ognissanti thanked the people of Bedford who thought about it, and said, "This is a great honor and a beautiful relief."

On the street with Alsterio Lambretta Club
The "Lambretta" bikes were unforgettable tours of the 7th-century fashion culture.
A group of Italian motorists tried to preserve the spirit of those times.
Seventy years after the first construction of the Alsterio Lambretta club, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland met this week in the Ferman district.
One of the first two members of the club, Chris Wilson, in 1966, bought the first Lambretta for about $40.
“I had a motor vehicle, but I realized that I could use it as well.
It was this kind of sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I must be there in my old age," he said.
"They were pretty good and pretty confident that you could buy it at an affordable price, and that you've got to run something more than just pull from point A to point B."
He participated in the opening of the Lambretta separate flight on the TT side of Meno Island.
The first Alsterio Lambretta club was founded in the early 8th decade and reorganized 12 years ago.
"About 1971 motorists and other forms of transport were still less dominant, and the club was in general affected by a lack of interest, so I thought, "All, this is the end," said Chris.
"Then for a while interest arose again and it seems to grow more and more."
Philipas Steele is a member of the Alsterio Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members, the secretary responsible for the members.
‘All reasons differ.
Some members were influenced by a culture of fashion, since it started almost everything.
Others are plane enthusiasts or rokers – you will find all people here.
There are also those who just enjoy the winter.
Many engines are to be modified, so there are no two units.
It is possible not to change engine speeds and can take 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved.
Some highly modified engines may reach 100 miles per hour speed."
During the week, efforts were made to stop some motorists from driving.
And although North Ireland is not always as beautiful as Lambretta's father in Italy, this time the sun was lit up by motorists driving around Ferman.
Ruth Davidson asks for the title "Brexito"
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow conservators for a period of time so that the Prime Minister could agree on "Brexito".
The head of the Scottish authorities claimed that within two years of the EU referendum, the time for the debate was delayed.
She expressed her opinion after the words of Boris Johnson on the premier plan he called it “unreasonably and completely absurd. ”
She claimed that it was time to support the Prime Minister in the BBC's Sunday Politicals Scotland.
“ For the past two years, ” she said, “we have had time for debates.
The former Foreign Secretary was responsible for the history of one of the best cabinets in the country and a large part of the current plan, which was already recognised last November.
The Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow him to conclude his deal and help him implement plans in the country.
I think that the period of silence would be very useful."
Her comments followed the 8th criticism in the Brexito debate, which was not the first time the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later confirmed that he believed in "Brexitu" and that its cabinet plan could ensure a smooth trade with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also said that by taking part in other elections, he would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence, as in 2014 he promised that this event would be the only one on their side.
When asked about possible repeated referendum on Brexito, she replied: “If we are talking about the history of Scotland, I have never said that you cannot repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and you are not satisfied with the outcome.
I would rather say that another referendum on "Brexito" could be held because I expected another outcome."

Christine'a Blasey Ford approved a statement on sexual harassment alleged by Brittas Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who had been in high school with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, was sexually abused by the candidate to Supreme Court, when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that even though he did not remember the holiday home where the funeral could take place, he believed in Ford's statement.
Earlier, Keyser announced during his lawyer's statement that he did not remember that festival and did not even know if he had met Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, witnessing before the Court Committee, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, but did not complain of Keyser's claim that he believed in Ford's words.
On Friday, President Trumpas directed the FTB to conduct a study within a week when the senator of the Republic Jeffas Flake and other congratulating senators requested time for the study and a week to postpone the entire Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to his lawyer committee saying he wanted to "how to contribute to an additional FTB study" on Kavanaugh.
"But as my client has explained, she does not recognize Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the evening or assembly in which he was with or without Dr. Ford," says Keyser, lawyer Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser “did not deny Dr. Ford’s statement and already said that he believed in Dr. Ford’s testimony.”
‘However, the simple and irreplaceable truth is that it cannot be confirmed, since it does not recall the above event’, the letter continues.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was apparently behind the funeral, also said to contribute to the FTB investigation.
The people of Chicago who are illegally convicted are talking about living with a corrupt police officer and receiving him
The chief prosecutor of Ilinaja is trying to change the history of Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unjust police officer used the innocent population of social housing and unjustly arrested a lot of people.
To date, 42 people have been unjustly convicted.
Ida Ida B. Wells's project's social housing project is currently just a blank space, and its former inhabitants have spent more than a decade of their lives in no uncertain terms using corrupt Chicago police.
They were directed by the nurse Ronald Watts.
The inhabitants accused him and his tactical pursuit of wealth, police reports and arrests and arrested him.
Willie's Martinas and Cleonas Glovis are two of the lawyers who have so far been convicted by Kim Foxx, the general prosecutor of the Kuko District.
“If you didn’t work together with him, you would end up bad.
You were against him.
You're going to stop him and profit him," said Cleona Glovis about Watts.
“I was very scared.
I wanted to run away from that area,
But I didn't have to go anywhere," said Willie Martin.
The justices of the Foxx ethics section will review further 30-40 cases related to Wattsu.
Ida B. Wells, resident of the social home, Landonas Allens said that many people decided not to talk about Watts.
"Many things were wrong," he said.
"But that didn't matter."
According to another former resident, Clarissos Baker, no one believed in the words of the residents about the current patient of official duty.
“They have their own gain.
Who will believe us?"
Baker said.
Joshua Tepferis, who worked on the Chicago University justice project, said that they had not really believed anything before.
"All are upset because these people didn't seem important to them and did not care, because they're the black people who will live in the social environment, so they're thought to be still guilty of something," Tepfer said.
‘Sergent Watts was sentenced to 22 months in prison for trying to train FTB informants.
Marteza Wise is also based on Watts' prison thanks.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to get in touch with him again," said Wisee.
"I lost four years without a cause."
72-year-old "Fidelity" believes in the success of blocks, virtual reality and working intelligence
The potential of the Fidelity blocks was still seen before 2018 when all the corporations were talking about this technology.
The Director-General, Abby Johnson, led investment to a cryptovalite, the most risky and unsustainable asset class in recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other older leaders were just laughing at what is going on, especially on the bitcoin market," Johnson said.
We started to talk and realized that we had to understand.
The fungus encouraged the start of a bitking in the New Hampshire department, when this encrypted price was about $180.
Last year, the price was nearly $20,000, and Johnson said, “we noticed that the price changes we started to work, even though we never believed it. ”
She didn't mean how many bits of bits were finished or how much Fidelity worked.
Fidelity workers are clearly familiar with these technologies.
There are now about 2,600 members of the Block Border Club, called "Bita and Blocks", organizing seminars and meetings with specialists.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the opportunity to verify the remainder of the encryption using the Fidelity mobile software.
In 2015 there was an opportunity to invest funds in small ones.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible methods of use of bitcoins or at least briefly rejected them.
We're trying to monitor the market.
And as long as Katie Chase, the chief technology centre strategy for Fidelity and the leader of the Block Border Incubator (FCAT) sought ways to use public and business block borders.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but he revealed that he had a great interest in clients, partners and employees.
‘Everything is still very new.
If you are interested in information, understand that you are still trying to find evidence of the concept," said Chase.
We are trying to adapt the block borders to different situations and we know a lot, but technology is not yet such a step to solve such problems."
As far as it is concerned, the group focuses more on trying to understand the nature of those obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate physical objects, such as art works, the value of chetons or use blocks in the supply chain.
"There's no focus on this, but I think it'll finally get interesting," said Chase.
Fidelity will be ready for it."
As an example, she pointed out the “Pebble” newspaper, which was completely unsuccessful in trade standards, but finally found Fidelity.
Their group set up a programme for the decommissioning period established after three years after the collection of millions through the Kickstarter sub-funding project.
The ‘Apple Watch’, ‘Fidelity’, appeared on the market, was ready.
She quickly accepted the Pebble programme for the new Apple product.
"We were not sure that the Pebble newspaper would be published, but we wanted to be ready if people would try to make it," she said.
"We were able to find knowledge and were prepared when the time spent on the market was spent on the machine."
The island of Sulawesi was devastated by earthquakes and tsunamis
On Friday, 29 September, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a mighty 7.5 earthquake, resulting in a tsunami, and almost 400 people were killed.

California schoolmates with racist inscriptions
As reported by the CNN branch of the KGTV, the Escondido Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students have taken a negative decision to demonstrate racism to senior classes in the event.
"We are proud that all of our schools are accepted and free of fear," said Director Adriana Lepe-Ramirez.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and segregation."
The report also states that the incident is investigated by Escondido's secondary school, union officials and local police.
‘The school administrators have contacted corrupt educational parents and survivors and will be subject to the prohibition of punishment’, states the report.
On the basis of a report from the police survey, students from the school in San Diego, north of the top classes, took the tract with the characters from which a racist inscription was produced and photographed.
The school usually confirms the records in advance, but the photograph is officially taken by some students who choose their words.
The Union report argues that such behavior is “not limited to the culture, values or history of the Escondido Secondary School”.
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"Escondido's secondary school is still closely related to family values and culture-based culture throughout the community."
Former teacher Cade's Pannell told the channel KGTV that the corrupt image appeared in the social media.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
“This seemed to them funny, but it didn’t.
Only indiscriminately can be drawn from such things."

On Sunday, he was arrested for the first time because of family violence.
According to the records of the court, the incident took place in Palinų's homes in Vasilo, Alaska, where Track Palina was injured by his father, Todd, who was injured by traffic accidents.

On the basis of the documents, Palina's police officers who spoke him came up with a "quick" and refused to use weapons.
The Court’s statement also indicates that the man was lying in the garage in front of his arrest.
In court documents, Sarah Palin said that her son had been "inspired" and "used some medications".
It was also confirmed that Track Palina had told the police a couple of bottles of oil before.

"Now I understand better than ever that the best of America needs a leader who will honor and value them."
Elizabeth Warren comments on candidates for presidents after mid-cedence elections
"It is time for women to move to Washington and correct the growing government that women have to lead," said the Democrat Senator, speaking in mini, gathered at the Holjoko train station in the city of Massachusetts.
"I therefore promise this: after 6 November it is appropriate to consider whether it is appropriate to apply to the presidents."
Warren, trying to cover up his position in a meeting with a representative of the Republic in Geoffu Diehl State, earlier said that the presidents were not candidates because he wanted to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus attention on the mid-term elections and conduct so that the only important thing would be 2020," she said to the reporters in August, speaking at the National Press Club.
"The most important battle is the mid-Cedation elections, and they will be important not only in Massachusetts but throughout the country."
Warren has long been considered a potential candidate for the 2020 democracy that can deal with President Donald Trumpu.
However, she would like to face the tough first elections, in which other known democracies, perhaps former Vice-President Joe Biden, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, were present.
A third fatal death in less than one year has been associated with a mental health clinic
According to The Mail, three people have been killed in a psychiatric clinic for more than a year.
The television comic girl Shaquelle Vidal (23) died on April 7, almost a month of voluntary leave in West London, Marylebone, in the Nightingale hospital.
Her son James Lyle (57) was the manager of the Risk Insurance Fund, the millions and former supporters of the Conservative Party, who paid for its maintenance costs for five years.
The future president of the city died almost six months ago from the day the peak of the strike took place in Daisy Boyd (28 C.E.), one of the founders of River Caffe, Rose Gray.
After his release from the authorisation firm, his successor, Dan Macmillan (43) died on 5 October following a crackdown from cocaine that the clinical visitor had illegally introduced.
Two months before his release from the hospital, the film theater player Alan MacDonald (61 year) was released four days ago.
In May, the Monitoring Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale Clinic, as this was not enough to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
The BBC’s Mock The Week comic book Avos Vidal daughter Shaquelle was registered at the Shaquelle clinic on 11 March.
A week ago, at a previous meeting of the Westminster Crown Court, the royal lawyer Katie Gollop said that on 29 March, Shaquelle died from AWOL and came back after a week.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Avos Vidal, said: "My client wants to know what happened to Shaquelle, what she was dealing with and what she was doing."
Ms. Lyle was called Shaquelle's daughter.
“I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time,” said John Gordillo (52 C.E.).
At the Gordillo meeting, he announced that Shaquelle had called on him on 4 April and said he wanted to buy and pour cyanido and he was 20 minutes from this call to the clinic "more than a dozen times" but no one noticed.
"I see that further events could have been avoided if someone had been left behind," he added.
On 5 April, the clinical doctor found that Shaquelle’s mental condition is very low."
Less than 48 hours later, she was on the flight computer.
The nightingale representative applied to the injured family and friends and said: “The purpose of our clinic is to provide high quality care in safety, therapy in a pleasant environment. ”

Led Zeppelin has been brought back to court for the alleged vegetarian „Stairway To Heaven» guitar refo
“Led Zeppelin” was brought back to court for the guitar rifle used in the 1971 Stariway To Heaven, which the group claimed to have stolen.
It is claimed that the part of the 1971 British group was disbanded.
The appeal court rejected the 2016 decision that the group did not copy the other group’s name ‘Spirit’.
The 2015 request was submitted by Michael Skidmore, a trusted guitarist.
It seems that the "Led Zeppelin" song "Starway To Heaven" will last a long time – just like it does.
The group will again stand before the court on the basis of the accusations of the 71st battalion.
The US Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 decision that the group did not copy fire from the Spirit music group.
It is claimed that the Court has made errors, for example, misinformation about copyright laws.
She was returned to the court.
Michael Skidmore's first search was submitted by Randy Wolfe, a guitarist.
Police officers finished Michigan when a police officer passed on their suspect's murder
At his daughter's murder, a suspect resident of Michigan was arrested after the police raids that ended him after he was transferred to the police car.
It is believed that Adam Nolinas was cast out of the city of Vajominge on Thursday, 33 C.E. – 27 C.E. Mae Randall.
He was brought to court on the fifth day of the hospital where he was found by the officer when he was transferred by the police car to the SUV, because Nolina attacked the police in an attempt to flee at a fast pace in which there was intense traffic.
He was convicted of five serious crimes, including murder to kill and escape from the police.
"It is not normal to go to court in the hospital, but this is not the first case," said Captain James Maguffee of the Vaomingo Police.
‘It is subject to appropriate treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
Judges often agree that this can be implemented."
Noline's daughter's body is found on the fourth day in the mobile home of Creekside Estates.
The mother of two children was shot in one cell, and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
The police then announced a public warning about Nolin and presented a short description of the man and his 1996 "Dodge" chip.
The guy noticed his pickup and went out to a fast US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolina and the pip took off into the concrete wall, then left the car and started running fast.
When he ran away, he attacked the constable police officers.
One police officer sat in the SUV car and took Nolin out of the garage.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolin was placed in a hospital with a severe but stable condition and remained there until he was released and transferred to a prison in the county of Kent.
"This incident has shown that West Michigan police are at risk of their health in order to protect the community," Magfee said.
"They've taken a man almost quickly and with appropriate measures, and we're going to raise them very much."
Two charges of murder to be filed against Nolun are also charged with fleeing the police, carrying a hidden weapon and committing a serious crime involving the use of a threatening weapon.
He has not yet been charged with his daughter's murder because the investigation continues.
"Of course, we will continue the investigation of the murder, which we will soon be able to submit to the county prosecutor of Kent for a while," said Maguffee.
The judge healed a blind man who had fled to his home for a lost sheep
The judge was not able to stand up to the man who stood before two criminals who tried to enter his house.
Although a fugitive was trying to take him to the forest, 63 - year - old David did not retaliate.
As a university overseer, the men who worked for the cause of war fought against two criminals and lost one of their teeth.
The hostages fled, but after the massacres, the blood was left on St. Oldham, which was found and arrested after four months.
In making a decision for Ford, who did not take the tooth while trying to pick up an individual's house in Ormskerke, Lancashire, Royal Justice Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t believe the reactions of Mr. Oldham — when you got up to see only eyes and noses, you met him at home, he interrupted you.
In addition, he and your partner, who tried to enter the second height and left the room.
On Friday, when Ford was sentenced to three years and four months, the judge said: “I believe you have two lessons.
First, you don't have to find out about David Oldham, second, you better don't talk to the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than before and you've been bitten by a dog.
That's a little bit of a punishment."
He added: "I want to thank Mr. Oldham for his reaction to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that for the crime, Fordas had already been sentenced to another imprisonment in 2016 and had to be sentenced to three years, but had been released fairly.
Mr Olddams Liverpool himself appealed to the royal court on 5 April when he heard the noise at home about 19.00 p.m.
“ Mr. Oldham, who is a victim of human abuse, suddenly left the house and turned his back on his former accusers, ” said Johns.
Fearing for his safety, he pushed him in the face, so to speak, and washed his teeth.
Then another archaeologist left the room in front of Mr. Oldham, who had instinctively cut him in the face."
According to Mr. Jones, the associate took a wooden plane and tried to drive Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, "Suck him, he's lost my teeth."
The co-rapporteur said to Mr. Oldhamu, "If you leave us, we'll go" and he and Ford fled from the crime scene.
On August 2nd, the police bought Ford in the Wavertree area in my name.
Forda's got the police dog, and then he's got it in his ass.
It is thought that the second intruder is still free.
Forda has no permanent residence for 25 years. He has recognised the charges of intrusion, confusion and dangerous driving, although he is prohibited and has no driver's certificate.
Tori’s activists responded to Johnson’s criticism of the appellants
Tori’s activists today buried Boris Johnson when he was adopted as a “meek and aggressive man. ”
P. Johnson, trying to influence ordinary people in his incomprehensible speech about "Brexit", received an ex-Minister of Commerce Digby's Jones' rigorous assessment, which was approved this afternoon by the members of the Birmingham Conference.
David also murdered Mr. Johnson because he was concerned about the title of the newspaper rather than the strict policy.
In his speech to MailOnline, Mr May added that he was simply "swift" because he was unable to be a complete leader.
The response was awaited when the former Foreign Secretary re-examined the Chequers Prime Minister's plan and concluded it "indiscriminately" and "very absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, which she did not agree with the outcome of two years ago in the referendum.
He also urged the Government to support ambitious projects, such as the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May pointed out that she was critical of playing political games and claimed that she was unable and ready for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC, the conference of judges, Mr. May said, "I believe in "Brexit".
Former Liberian Minister for Trade, Lord Jones, now acting independently, has gained the minimum approval by hearing the vision of Brexito.
People were surprised when he made an opinion about Mr. Johnson, who apparently responded to concerns from businessmen.
In particular, without mentioning Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones was able to understand that he was “a quiet and aggressive man. ”
"The business is very important, so the former foreign secretary said that there is really a weak and aggressive person," he said.
"The whole thing is not with him."
Lord Jones has also improved his speech in the room following the response of Mr. May to the meeting of the leaders of Zalcburg to the EU's headquarters plan.
In the course of the negotiations on "Brexito" he was also criticised by the leader of the Scottish tribunal, Ruth Davidson.
Mr. May's associate in the Ministerial Chamber MailOnline said that the intervention is not very serious and Mr. Johnson does not have sufficient support for Parliamentary bodies to be able to remove the Prime Minister.
They said: “There is no such thing as this.
He is disappointed, but he does not have enough supporters in Parliament's party, and he himself knows that.
We see the contrast between David, who expressed his opinion respectfully and Boris, who satisfied his personal ambition."
Business secretary Greg Clarkas criticised Mr Johnson, who had scepticized businessmen looking at "Brexit".
At the Burminmege conference, Mr. Clarks said that Mr. Johnson had been “very wrong”.
He said: “I am amazed that someone in the community can think that way.
There is no successful economy in the world, which would not be a successful retail business."
In an interview with Sky News, Mr. Davis acknowledged that the coming months will not be easy, as the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to give a lot of relief.
However, he believes that the government must not compromise and reach a similar agreement in Canada, rather than what the Cabinet of Ministers proposes.
When asked how Mr. Johnson was going to lead the courts, he did not allow the opportunity to entrust the former foreign secretary.
Commenting on Johnson's proposal to establish a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the shortcomings of the British policy is the idea of a fantastic policy."
He added: "Our association is catholic and many of its ideas are suitable for titles, but not strict policies."
Bulgaria spent €80 million on the poor restaurant of European taxpayers' money
Bulgaria spent $80 million on European taxpayers' money on old-fashioned chicken restaurants, which now appear to have been built at the same time from "Surrey and Cartoon".
The Balkan country has issued €80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
After returning to the previous size, the restaurant was filled with weeds.
The local government of the territories in the Kraków State promised to transfer undisclosed jobs.
The Bulgarian government has spent ten million EU-free-medium chicken restaurants.
The Balkan countries spent $80 million from the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of old pillars and pillars, but instead of bringing back their previous size, they gained benefits from construction work.
The remains of the well - abandoned reconstruction seem to be the same as the construction of the "syria and retonne" and therefore are not attractive to tourists.
For example, thinkers found that the fortress of the ancient Middle Ages of the city of Pernik in western Bulgaria, Krakra and the Roman fortress Trayanov Vrata near Ihtman, was rebuilt using a polymer concrete, most commonly used for the foundation.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian Government have privately agreed that this failure must be taught.
"The fortress is in a state of confusion," said architect and memorialist Stella Duleva about Trayan Vrata.
She was 16 centuries old, and now she's infected."
Such reactions were expected after the Kraków fort restaurant in Pernik, so the local government promised the removal of the package in 2019.
Perniko's strength due to unexpected modifications has been taken out of the ‘pills from the cartridge’.
The Yailata fortress is planted in the "syrian fortress" because it has been restored from large white blocks that are not in contact with air conditions.
These unsuccessful efforts are in line with new doubts as to how the European Union is using development funds.
Styling americans go to the event this year “Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride”
Hundreds of fashionable motorcyclists from all over the United Kingdom are allowed to travel on windmills to collect money for the Movember Fund.
The event is called “Kilnaus jentelmene’s journey” and is organised annually to collect money and increase public awareness of prostate cancer.

The "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" event was held in Sydney, Australia, for the first time by Mark Hawkas.
The idea was inspired by Dono Draper's picture of the Mad Men series, where he sat on the classic motorcycle with the best in his row.
In London this year, hundreds of passengers, including a trained taxi breed dog, were riding in the Tuere Valley.

A 24-year-old girl died from an unknown training platform for body sizes
At the training platform, the unrecognised British athletes decided not to delay.
Jessica Mayho, who won a silver medal at the British athletic champion of this year, said he was shocked on Thursday at Lidso Station.
At the age of 24 and five, Mr. Mayho, of 11 Colosseum, said that without the trainer, she was raped by a man with words.
About 5:00 a.m. on the platform, the bat was pulled out by the "star".
However, the source of the sport star, aimed at the location in the Tokyo Olympic Games of 2020 in the Great Britain team, was revealed to men.
In the evenings of the city of Kitty, Jorkshire, U.S.A., Dr. Mayho said: “The last time other people were in the full platform, their eyes filled with tears.
Such people can be deceived and forced not to trust themselves, but they are MANO's body, MANO's "mechanism".
On Twitter, the young athlete received much support in the social media.
The MBE commander, Andy Lewis, wrote: “Stora!!!!
Can he walk or walk?
That's cool, Jesse, it's all right with you.
Don't let a fool get hurt at you."
Gavin Gray added: "I'm sorry.
Not only because of him but also because of the circumstances that ignored him.
I'm glad you're all right.
You're an example for young people.
You have shown that you need to be proud of yourself, and you can be disappointed!"
At the University of Ledso, Mr. Mayho was interested in the age of one of her senior sisters' coaches.
Since then, she has been able to locate the second place at the British senior champion of Muller, which took place in Birmingham this year.
It won the British championship medal just a month after the victory in the North English games.
Aletė refused to comment more on the event.
If you pay less than 50 million users, Facebook will pay $1.25 billion fine
By using a safety shield, criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebooks.
However, it is only after three days of a large increase that has been reported on the fifth day.
Now Facebook, in accordance with new European data laws, is a huge waste of money
After a discount of less than 50 million, Facebook may have to pay $1.25 billion.
Criminals were able to reach a security alert and could therefore reveal a lot of confidential personal information.
However, Facebook reported on the invasion only on Friday, three days later, and until evening it was not able to tell how much British appointments were damaged.
As long as the search for programmes continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks how the media has complied with European data compliance requirements because its central residence in Dublin, criticised the company by saying: “Transmission is inexhaustible.”
According to new European Union data laws, Facebook is a major offence because companies may be required to pay up to four per cent of the world’s turnover.
Last year, Facebook earned € 31.2 billion.
Criminals have reached a deadline using the Facebook function "See How" to allow users to see how their profiles appear to others.
Dies journalist and author Vladas Dargis
V. Dargis was born on 2 August 1926.
At the end of the second world war, in 1944, he moved from Kaunas, where he had learned and lived, to the West, from 1947 to England.
In 1992, he returned to Lithuania and lived in Vilnius.
1952-1957. Mr. Dargis was leading the "Nida Press" in London.
In 1954 he established a Nidos book club and conducted it until 1957 and 1983-1991.

MG Baltic case: accused interviewer Gabriel Landsberg
The hearing of the Court opened a conversation (meeting of November 2015) between former Vice-President Raimondo Kurlianski and former former "worker" of Vytauto Gapši.
When you hear the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what people in charge are talking about right now.
True, it is heard in the audience that Mr. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys are talking about a Christmas celebration, several times the name of the current conservative leader Gabriela Landsberg is hard to understand.
To be submitted to and to natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, the charges are made against three legal and five natural persons: Labour and Liberal parties, the MG Baltic, former liberal and "working" leaders of E. Masiuli, Vytatu Gapshi, former parliamentarian of S. Gustani, Seimo Member of S. Steponavič and former vice-president of MG Baltic.
The Labour Party claims to have an effect on taxation and trade, the Liberal Union is accused of fraud, trafficking and abuse, and the MG Baltic is accused of buying and selling them.
The officials suspect that the policy was taken or consulted by the vice-president of MG Baltic and then proposed or supported a positive initiative in the Seima and other institutions.
The former president of the Liberal Union, E. Masiulis, is accused of the effects of trafficking, torture and illegal exploitation, which was the opposition of Vice-President of this party to Mr. Steponavic, former member of the Council of Vilnius, to Mr. Gustavi - to torture.
V. Gapšys is accused of the effects of fraud and trafficking, Mr Kurlianskis - the effects of buying and selling.
Question: What is the greatest opportunity to win the second presidential election?
The interview on the second round of elections included four candidates at the top of the rankings - economist Gitanas Nausėda, President of the candidate Saul Skvernelis and two Fathers Union – candidates from the first elections of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) Party - Seimo Member Ingrida Shimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Uschackas.
In fact, on Sunday it became clear that TS-LKD was supported in the markets by I. Shimonytė, and V. Uschacka was withdrawn from the electoral struggle.
As the data show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second president's authority would win Mr. Nausėda, but the head of the "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys said that it is too early to make conclusions.
"It separates (of others – DELFI) Newness, but it is very important to see whether the parties are talking about or about the people who are dynamic.
These doubts of Shimonyta were from one study to another, and Nausadas had stopped growing, and Uzachko was even reduced.
It's very important for you to grow up," said sociologists.
In addition, in the light of the results of the survey, it is clear that a small percentage of people are still not aware of the vote or are generally thinking that they are not going to vote.
If the second presidential elections were to meet I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernel, the fight would be interrupted - 32.7 per cent for I. Šimonyt would vote, 30.9 per cent for S. Skvernel.
The truth is, even 36.4 per cent of the people responded that they did not vote for either one of these candidates or did not know what to vote for or not attend the elections.
Sociologas V. Geidys once again stressed that we have not yet seen a full picture, because there is no announcement of all candidates who would be able to apply to a less successful Lithuanian electorate.
"If we look at the elections last year, there are many parties in Lithuania where their candidates are?
For example, where's the candidate for Social Democrats? He's been a candidate for 30 years, not yet?
When you get up, you'll see how his options relate to other candidates.
So this side of Lithuania, which is less successful than anything is less reflected," said V. Gaidys.
In his speech to the University of Vilnius International Relations and Political Science Institute (IU TSPMI), Politologist Ms. Jastramskis said that before the end of the year, the conclusions were too early, and all three candidates, who refused to take part in the struggle with V. Ušack, appear on the basis of the circumstances.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference in 5 percentage points is certainly not a single candidate's advantage.
The only thing I could see was that Nausada would look well before Ushack (...) later, bearing in mind if those people were really going to vote.
The news before the Squad is also good, but we are now comparing apples and apples, because, for example, Neuseda has already announced that he is a participant, the Skuvernellis has not been published.
In addition, the poll was made before the first conservators' elections, as it would look after them?" said the politician.
According to him, Mr. Nauseda has a small pulse, but when all the candidates are already published, he can cancel.
"The situation is quite the same.
Nausėda, Skvernelis, Shimonytė - the results are relative.
I would like to recall that after the elections of the President for the last half year before 2003, Rolands Paksas had a 5 per cent support to vote for him and then won the elections.
This cannot be done in any way," said Mr Jasramskis.
DELFI recalls that candidates in the presidential elections have already been announced by economist Mr Nausėda, Member of the Seimo I. Shimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juosaitis, economist, member of the Seimo, Aušra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Union, member of Petras Austrevičius, member of the Seimos Ngolis Puteikis and member of the European Parliament, Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accuses Israel of attempted cyberattacks
"The regime that uses cyber-weapons' history is clear from such cases as "Stuxnet" (transition) and is currently trying to damage Iran's communications infrastructure," wrote Minister of Information Mohammad Javadas Azari Jahromi through Twitter.
He was referring to an attack by Stuxnet in 2010 on the virus that damaged Iran's nuclear facilities.
This harmful program is thought to have been developed in Israel and the United States.
"Because of the strength of our technical teams, they are left with empty hands.
We will continue to talk about this opposition at international forums," stressed Mr. J. A. Jahromi.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fatthai said that the technical team had made many attempts to seek refuge in their systems on Monday, but the suspects had "a firm opening".
The "Impuls" health club did a bad thing for men, it couldn't recover.
The accident occurred at 10.40 a.m.
In 1945, the pool was badly damaged by a man’s swimming pool.
He was quickly expelled from the water, but he was already unconscious.
It was a test to get him.
Soon after recovery, a medical doctor tried to cure him, but he was unable to save his life.
Instead, he died in a fast car.
This accident was recommended by the head of the "Impuls" network of Health Clubs, Antanas Sakalauskas.
"In our data, 73-year-old men visited our health club on Monday morning with the woman.
The customer in the pool jumped for about 30 minutes, then moved to the bus stop to relax and, after a few minutes, unexpectedly broke down.
The country was a person - a client who called at the pool together - immediately responded, pulled him out of the water and began to receive.
The man was kept awake until the early dawn.
The club staff immediately received rapid medical assistance, which came within 5 minutes.
When he arrived, the doctor restored the man’s pulse and breathing and transferred him to a medical car.
At the hospital, doctors tried to stabilize the man’s health, but after 20 minutes we received information that he was not alive.
We are a shame to the dead man's family because of his disability.
According to the previous data, the incident could have resulted in customer health problems.
According to the information provided to the family medicine, he is suffering from diabetes.
We remember that in the face of serious health problems, it is always important to assess your options and consult doctors and health clubs specialists.
In all the facilities of the health clubs, there is a built-in supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, to access it and to ensure the safety of customers, he separates from other employees a clear protection.
Such base supervisors have radio stations where they can contact the administration and registration immediately, respond to their requests or seek assistance.
Four times a year staff training is carried out in relation to the security programme - much more often than that required by law.
At the same time, workers are spreading theoretical and practical knowledge, learning how to act in the event of an accident, monitoring or ensuring proper compliance with the rules of procedure and internal procedures.
How Portugal radically solved the heroin problem
In the 10th decade, Portugal faced a heroin crisis.
Each porter knew something that would have happened to this dead drug.
Now, just a few decades ago, the country is becoming one of the lowest drug - related deaths in the world.
In Norway, the son didn't come to Grazina: he changed even four families and doesn't speak Lithuanian
As stated in the LNK press report, Lithuania did not have the right to bury the children four years ago and to see them with the Norwegian Children's Rights Service Barnevernet and the Court of Justice.
The woman’s story created an international scandal that followed all the media.
People's pickets for the return of the boy to Lithuania were also prepared for his duties in Lithuania and Norway.
However, the public was not able to restore the sons of Lithuania’s citizenship to Grazina and her family.
Today, a woman says how she has been separated from her son for the past few years and how she and her child have been attending meetings after two years.
At the time Gražina was not entitled to bury the sons, the boys were 8 years old, now 12 years old, starting to grow up.
In the first two years, Gražina had never seen a son, it was forbidden.
Then Grazina was granted the right to meet his son twice a year, only after an hour.
During the last few months of the hearing, the number of hearings for the Lithuanian court increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
The encounters with the sons always remind us of the consequences of a severe arrest - monitoring of officials, and the execution of a secret operation.
"The son has changed even four families and does not speak Lithuanian," - the heart this afternoon towards Gražina, her statement - in the LNK table
Eligija Masiuli will not be returned to personal money taken over
The appeal court announced on Tuesday that the defendant's appeal was rejected.
The contract shall be final and shall be without prejudice to it.
In the case of political corruption, former head of the Liberian army, E. Masiulis called on the Appeals Court, asking him to return any personal money - the money received from him and his wedding money.
A total of more than EUR 242 000 was taken from E. Massio.
The temporary limitation of ownership law applies to these moneys, which is constantly extended.
For the last time, Vilnius District Court extended it on 15 October.
E. Masiulis The Court of Appeal did not ask for all the money back - it seeks to recover from the wedding money of EUR 800 and its currency - EUR 690, US$ 130, US$ 1600.
The former policy said that the last money was allocated to the planned US road.
E. Masiuli's lawyer Mindaugas Bluvas of the Court of Appeal asked to return these money on the first day because the spouses had the opportunity to have such amounts.
The prosecutor, Justa Lucius, asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The judgment of the Civil Court is legal and justified, no more property is limited, as indicated in the allegations made.
The Court rightly found that there are grounds for the confiscation of property, as well as for the confiscation of extended property," said J. Laucius at the court's meeting.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court decided not to repay more than EUR 242 000 for the alleged political corruption of E. Masiuli.
These funds will be found in the face of a series of accusations of corruption in previous policies at home and in the car.
The three judges' College found that the material of the case showed that property rights were limited only to funds consisting of the crime committed by E. Masiuli.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it is concluded that the right of the alleged property is not limited to disproportionately or too long to be applied," says the Court of Justice Nijol Žimkienės, Jürgitos Kolyčienės and Ogniaus Trumpulio.
The Court noted that E. Massius was accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal case was large and complex, so it was necessary to extend the time limit for the alleged property restriction in order to ensure that the property was confiscated and that it was extended.
The prosecutors claim that former vice-president Raimondas Kurlianskis gave 106 thousand euros to E. Masiuli for the decision to make useful decisions on the case in Seima.
Both accused believe that E. Masiul found money - 90,000 euros - was R. Kurlianski's loan.
According to the case data, across the street to E. Masiul, there are 242.4 thousand euros, 130 United Kingdom weights and 1.6 billion US dollars.
E. Massius and his lawyer did not try to recover money, but the courts rejected their requests.
The former policy has said that the share of these funds belongs to others and has been intended to invest in real estate or to be part of his family's money.
He also claimed that there was no evidence that money would be obtained in a criminal way.
In the past, the Appeals Court has announced that the allegations made by E. Masiul that these funds could have been received by accepting more than 100 thousand euro coins.
The lawyer argues that the remaining net money could have been obtained from undeclared sources, undeclared, uncertified documents and perhaps no legal income.
In the case of political corruption, the charges are filed against three legal persons - the Labour Party, like the Liberal Union, the MG Baltic Group.
In addition to E. Masiuli, the charges are filed against former "worker" Vitatuu, former parliamentarian of Sarūn Gustani, Seima of Gintar Steponavic and former vice-president of MG Baltic for R. Kurlianski.
R. Kurlianskis is accused of giving a kiss to former parliamentarians E. Masiuli, St. Gustavi and V. Gypsey.
The Americans were in danger of destroying the Russians.
During the 25-minute transition, the U.S. military forces said, the Russian SU-27 was directly ahead of the aircraft.
The Russian aircraft broke down for the second time, using the speed of the train and made an effort with the gear.
The passengers reported a feeling of turbulence during the first approach and pressure during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to carry out international air operations, but this interaction was not independent.
We look forward to international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are in conformity with the 1972 Convention on Maritime Accidents and Overseas Prevention (INCSEA) - in its report the U.S. military forces said.
"Insecure actions increase the risk of inappropriate calculation and possible encounters," noted the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but it was expected that the Russian SU-27 was waiting for a "safe distance" from the US airport.
The costs of parents are not reduced further: only up to EUR 50 per month for obligor activities
According to the survey conducted by the company "Balta Studies" at the end of August, a survey revealed that a third (32%) of their single-year school-age child's "repurchase" was allocated less than 100 euros this year, a fifth (21%) was issued from 101 to 150 euros, three out of 10 (29%) from 151 to 200 euros, and that less than a fifth (18%) of their child's school was spent at the end of the summer.
The parents whose children started attending the first class this year left their child with an average of €220 for school leave, and the other parents whose children had already completed the first class gave their child a lower amount - an average of €160.
It is not a waste of time and science to escape, as parents often have to prepare money for their children’s grandparents and corrections.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one beer may vary from 20 to 100 euros in the country.
Parents who have school - age children were asked to tell them what average amount they are planning to devote to their one child’s demanding employment within a month.
The fourth (23 per cent) of the children surveyed were scheduled to pay up to EUR 20 per month, and the fourth (26 per cent) claimed to pay up to EUR 50, three out of ten (31 per cent) to require the child to work from EUR 50 to 100 per month, and the sixth (17 per cent) of the parents indicated that the plan was intended to allocate EUR 100 or more.
In fact, in Lithuania, children of school age are assigned an informal school curriculum of 15 euros a month.
However, these funds can be used only for one beer, and if the price of employment is higher, the difference must be covered by the parents.
In the case of a child who has a number of births or a number of school - age children growing in the family, the cost of childcare may increase twice.
According to the marketing director of the company "Vivus.lt" Justina Ambrasia, small or medium-sized income for families who receive income to save children for their parents, especially when several children grow up in the family, can become a little challenge.
In the early years of science, parents developed their heads, from where they could get money training, office goods, or new sports equipment.
Now is the main concern - how to hire children after school without spending money on that burden.
We note that parental expenditure is particularly increasing in August when it is necessary to prepare properly for the new academic years, but it remains longer than in summer, as parents are willing to invest in their regrets.
Often, when money is scarce and responsible for their potential, they become tired and self-debt," says J.Ambrasia.

Caucasian juice with a quarter of throlebus
Today, a fourth of the mobile street exhibition "Atia Old, Good News" appeared on Kauna streets - a poem and a recording of "Sienographer's records" marked with ancient trolebus.
The municipality of Kaunas reported on the new holiday trolebus.
"This old "Skoda" has also changed its very red color to a much more colourful and smoother care.
It will also show the "Atia elders, good news!" – representatives of the municipality of the town of Atia.
The mobile street art shows "Atia's old, good news" for greeting with the old trolebums, which will be replaced by new ones next year.
For the next year, old "Schoda" trolleys will be replaced by 85 new ones and modern "Solaris" trolleys.
The portal reminds us that the first road opened by a trolebus on the Kauna road a month ago.
On the trolebus picture are some well-known accents of Kauna street art - old mud and drums.
Not long after the first visit to Kaunas, the artist of the second street artist Timothy Norvilos - Morfai.
The left-hand side of the triangle is a yellow car, which is often referred to as "freedom".
"You wanted to put on a trolley.
This smile looks very relaxed, especially because it is also in line with troleous wheels.
When the wheel is on the wheel, it looks like it's part of the car.
When we broke the white wheels, we made them into retro-styles, which was very interesting all along.
Before the trolebubus tunnels had been dug out, there was really no such jokes," - as before the portal of Kauna.diea.lt spoke on the street artist.
On 27 October, however, the ban was lifted on the third trolebus.
It is mixed with white, yellow, orange, red, but most of the blue.
This color is dominant.
On the side of the trolebubic cable, one of the K.Donalach's houses, on the right, is the central post.
"Vabal" has always been my favorite," Morphea started the third troleaby by looking at the artist, Morphea.
New market
"Kauna Day" recalls that last week Kaunas public transport company "Kauna buses" with the Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A. signed a 29.4 million contract, indicating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolebuses.
"The Kaunas invests the largest amount for the renewal of public transport throughout their history.
This agreement allows all of us to replace the trolebus of the old "Skoda" brand after many years of service and offer the most comfortable services for passengers.
New low-tech trolleys will have more seats, efficient living room conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's place of work.
The new technology and the equalisation of the network of contacts and street repair works allow the trolebuers to drive more reliable, much faster.
And, of course, modern design trolebodies are very popular in the city," said Mindaugas Grigelis, director general of Kauna buses.
The first new trolleys will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all the old trolleys will be replaced by December.

Hercogene Meghan has replaced the British royal chambers.
This proves the special guest of Queen Elzbiet II: British monarch Kaládoms invited Saxes' mother, Doria Ragland, to the British press.
Such honor is not to be seen by even Herculaneum Kate's parents.

An unnamed source for Sunday Express revealed that the invitation of Doria Raglabd is "the flag of the kingdom".
Through the royal wedding, Doria took over the royal crown of glory.
The invitation to celebrate Caládas together also raised the language that Dr. Ragland is planning a longer apartment in Great Britain.
She is surprised that she wants to help her daughters before and after birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born early in the spring of 2019.
"Galgiri" in the arena and again shows "Mother's world"
The 16th show of "Women's World" has to be unattended - women announce a long week because even four days of hottest fashion, style and beauty news are already here - November 8-11, Kauna "Zalgirio".
As the years pass, seeing how the event faces change, shows that it is no longer a series of purchases, but a tradition that takes time.
It often becomes the place of friends and the reason for spending the day with their son or mother.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - each woman here can learn the secrets of the puzzle, learn the tricks that seem to light up every day, find the unchanged products, hear or try various procedures that stop the process of skin aging.
All this and more, it asks 415 participants to show their field in all three arena heights.
Three days will be held in the fields of beauty and health, and the next day representatives of partial sex will be able to listen to advice in a unique way to get out of the screens of the Stylist and netizens of Victoria’s University.
Much of the women in the business are faced with limited situations, as stress hampers stable emotional and physical conditions.
For this reason the Kaunas Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Amateur and the Network of Business Women, the birth of a conference on "Versley and Happiness". Without stress, in which discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
Like every year, I'm showing a bunch of events for great masters.
The exhibition's long-term partners, the Association of Chirpians and Beauty Specialists, will allow two days to teach the subject of hair recognition and modeling from the International Academy of Viinokurov & Friends forurto charismatic dueto - S. Maslov and R. Sakalausko.
In order to further improve the field of the art of imagination and the fight against the Art Battle, which will not give rise to doubt.
Tarsi's rise on the cake will become the Christmas festival of the world's beautiful representatives "Su birthday, Lithuania", in which centuries of prognosis will be possible to develop an unprecedented show - from body vision to shock.
There will be no forgotten and another tradition of "Mother's world" - the presentation of the newest collections on Friday's "Mados and beautiful show", where the most stylish collection will be.
And manual workers will be expected to be at the Decostujas in creative works where they will be able to cut back on the interior of the original home or prefer to decouple gifts.
The last day of the show is especially expected for all the lengths, as traditional visitors have traditionally enjoyed the competition "LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where the new longest cash records are collected each year.
Premier: the wage of teachers after the introduction of an ethical fee rose to 117 euros
Since September's introduction of the Ethate payment model, the average wage of the unemployed country has increased by 117 euros, according to Prime Minister Saulius Skvernel.
"It is early to say how much it (new procedure - BNS) has benefits or shortcomings.
The fact is that those people who have a full job load - their wages grow more than 117 euros on average," said Mr Skvernellis to the government on the first day.
The Lithuanian Union of Education Workers' Professional Union (LSDPS) plans to implement a strike for ethical payment called "democratic law", but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the process of education.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are allowed.
If it is considered necessary to strike, it is their right to decide.
Only then would it be wrong for children, scientists, to suffer in this area.
If the strike is to be carried out, it must be carried out in accordance with existing laws," said Mr Skvernel.
The Seimas approved a model of ethical teachers' work, which was introduced from September.
The teacher's salary has changed the hourly payment - the teacher's status is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time shall be divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. training, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andreas Navicko, is called absurd, claims to be adopted by the "buldozer" principle and announces an unprecedented strike on 12 November.
The PSC requires immediate withdrawal of this "minute" pay system and the setting up of a standard model in which one stage would be set at least 18 contact hours.
It is also responsible for increasing the fixed share of payments by 20% and reducing the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, the criticism of the introduction of a new method of distribution of learning funds is because, on the one hand, there is insufficient funding for home education, classes to participate in groups, qualifications, education assistance, and in large cities as well as in large cities.
The Ministry of Education and Science said that the ethical pay of teachers' work allows them to regulate the burdens of the educational work and to pay for all the work done by the school community.
It is expected that the teacher will be able to work for the community up to half of all hours during the year, the first two years of work - up to 40% of all hours.
It shall be determined that teachers' working time is 36 hours per week, of which not more than 24 contacts per week are required to teach the necessary thing (for things).
About half of the 100 general education schools, farms and non-formal education institutions have contributed to the two-hour strike launched by LSDPS.
There are about 53 000 pedagogues throughout Lithuania.
Need to be prepared: crisis can be expected within 2-3 years
Economic growth and even crises can be expected over the next 2-3 years, but both the Lithuanian bank and both the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, the "Verlo position" was said by Vitas Vasiliauskas, president of the Lithuanian Bank.
"To say that the crisis is already outside the camp, I certainly cannot, but there are really signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy is growing by more than 3 per cent, and the next year it is expected to grow by 2.8 per cent.
The main knowledge I would like to say to society and business - let's all be ready," said V. Vasiliauskas.
In his view, there are no uniform crises, so they need to be prepared differently.
The difference from the ten-year crisis is that at the time, the government believed that income generated by the growing economy would last forever and that the cost was planned.
Thus, after the crisis ended in 2008, there was a dramatic reduction in costs.
Now, according to V. Vasiliausko, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"Yes, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already above the potential and that we need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has not done so," said the President of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
V. Vasiliauskas is worth 7 out of 10 votes in favour.
According to him, a small and open economy such as Lithuania is very much in operation by external factors.
Today's big drummers - the US, China, the European Union - will no doubt be among us.
That is why we must be very careful.
In the presence of small economies, it is possible for us to decide everything, but I can't do it," said V. Vasiliauskas.
What is the future for those who have made great loans?
V. Vasiliauska, the European Central Bank has clearly set up a short-term strategy, and decisions on change of interests can be expected not earlier than the summer of the following year: "The main objective at this time is to try to manage expectations".
The trend, which leads to the greatest concern for the leader of the Lithuanian bank, is a reduction in the labour force in our country.
"The reduction in labour hands is a small part of the decision and a reduction in economic competitiveness.
In addition, this is also a reduction in data managers.
Migration has allowed this process to be somewhat balanced this year, but it does not know whether it has been a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliauskas.
Elta recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy is up to 3.4% this year, another 2.8%.
The Swedish Conservatives Leader will try to form the government again
Sweden, which has been in a political shelter for two months after the elections, will receive a second chance to form a government on the first day of the election, the President of Parliament announced.
Ulfo Kristersson (Ulfo Kristerson) The final party belongs to the four right parties of the centre, Aljansus, which, during the 9 September elections, received a little less votes than the former ruling centre's military coalition.
Both blocks were difficult to overcome the majority of the remaining parties to the anti-imigrant Party of the Swedish Democrats, the result of which is the movement of the Neonians.
The first U.S. Kristerson's attempt to form the government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, the Prime Minister, Stefana Lofven (Stefana Lioven), announced his failed trial and finalized his term of office.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, Parliament's President Andreas Norlenas said that the next week he would propose to Parliament Mr. Kristersson as a candidate to the Prime Minister, thus encouraging the first vote from the beginning of the government's efforts to form.
"It's not clear from the past whether the various parties will take Ulf Kristersson as prime minister," said journalist A. Norlen.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamic between the parties must change".
"The real deal must be over," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is not yet clear, but Mr Norlen said that the date is 14 November between possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament may four times ask any candidate to form a government with which Parliament would agree.
If all four tests are unsuccessful, the country must prepare new elections.
The current appointment of U. Kristerson is the third test of A. Norlene.
Some of the parties and the groups of Christian democracies of the Diaspora Party and Aljanso's partners pressure Mr. Kristersson to accept the support of the party of the right-wing Party of Sweden, but he has not yet denied such an opportunity.
Sweden's Democratic Party, which received 17.6 per cent votes during the elections and is the third largest party, is ignoring the long term of the main weighting party.
The Overseas Party, having successfully benefited from the election of voters for immigration following the arrival of nearly 400 thousand asylum seekers in the country since 2012, calls for impact on decision-making in exchange for assistance.
However, members of the Alliance are liberal and centrally opposed to such ideas.
Since 2014, the S. Lofven Social Democrats' Labour Party (SAP) has been in the process of creating opportunities for inter-block cooperation, but only if it maintains the prime position.
The Party of Albanians and Swedish Democrats rejected such an opportunity.
Delegation of the Afghan Government to participate in peace negotiations in Russia
Following this month's participation in the international negotiations on peace talks in Afghanistan, the delegation of the Government of Kabul notified officials on the first day.
The Taliban will consider whether to participate in their activities.
On the sixth day, Russia announced that on 9 November in Moscow would hold such a conference, although the US is currently trying to negotiate with the Taliban for the end of the 17-year conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Government of Afghanistan, responsible for the coordination of efforts with combatants, sent four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, the AFP said to the representative of Sayeds Ihsanas Taheri (Sajidas Ihsanas Taheris).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has refused to answer whether it will send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on the initiative of peace negotiations between Kabul and Taliban.
We are still in touch with the Russian officials, said the representative of Sebathayullah Ahmadi (Sebagutula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts under the Afghan leadership.
The Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahidas (Zabiula Mudjahidas) said that the movement is still being forgotten.
Moscow also invited representatives from the US, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, formerly accused of supporting Afghanistan's Taliban, "mainly involved", AFP said the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisal (Muhamadas Faisal).
The United States Embassy in Kabul has not responded to the request to comment.
The meeting was originally planned in Moscow on September, but it was delayed when Kabul claimed that it would be conducted by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place in the opium.
The newly appointed US Peace Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzadas (Zalmajius Challzadas) is trying to convince Taliban to agree on the end of the war and is ashamed that the majority meeting in Russia could slow down these efforts.
One U.S. Government Supervisory Authority stated last week that the Government of Kabul has been weakened in recent months by the government of Afghanistan.
Kubos President Pchenjane met with the leader of North Korea
North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Čen Unas) and Cuban President Miguel Diazas-Canalis (Migelis Diass-Canalis) agreed to develop and strengthen the strategic relations of their countries on the first day of the North Korean state press release.
Mr. Diazas-Canalis, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip to the government in April, opened his business with his wife on Sunday.
He met Kim Jong Unas at the airport; the leaders introduced him to the city for the best of them.
The North Korean state press reported that the leaders held negotiations at the Paekhwawon National Houses, emphasised the overall socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much details, but it indicated that the atmosphere of the negotiations was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be considered a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress in the issue of North Korea's denuclearization are increasingly difficult.
Pchenjana, who has also sought the approval of Moscow during the past week, is strengthening the U.S. Secretary of State Mike's Pompey (Maiko Pompey) and North Korea's main negotiator, Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo), New York.
Last week, Pchenjana criticized the United States for the undisputed sanctions - a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea will be able to further develop a nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change its course.
Sanctions are important to the agenda of Mr Diazo-Canelli.
Last week, while visiting Moscow, Mr Diazas-Canalis discussed nearly 50 million dollars (EUR 43.8 million) of arms contracts with Russia and received similar Vladimiro Putino's promise to develop political, economic and military ties.
Both Presidents then made a joint statement that affected the US 'inland affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, initially introduced in 1958 and later extended, remains valid.
The US and the European Union have been imposed on Russia in the form of sanctions against the United States of America and the Russian Federation for the axiety and support of the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diazas-Canalis has to leave Pchenjan on Tuesday.
He's still going to China, Vietnam and Laos.

Record: the athlete covered Britain within 157 days
The British athlete came out of the sea on Sunday to the newspaper of England, and became the first man to leave the wall to visit Great Britain.
The 33 - year - old Roses Edgley (Rossa Edglis) spent 157 days at the water and reached an altitude of 2,883 miles [2,883 km].
He flew in six hours and led him to the next support ship.
The last love of the athlete was followed by hundreds of colleagues.
He went to the newspaper at Margeite in the south of England - i.e. this is where R. Edgley started his trip on June 1.
The athlete, planning to sleep within 100 days, said to his trusted neighbors on the side, "Get out of here, I'll be back."
He said that after he went to the newspaper, the first relief came.

Macabrian Forest Secret: One suspect already held
This was a terrible family of the past, for the killings were severely punished.
Only in such circumstances was this crime known, since the victim had no friends and was not reported for his trial.
According to earlier data, he was not in his early teens.
It's like he's suspected of killing him.
One week later, the Kaunas District Court allowed them to be arrested for three months.
The second one, who is suspected to have fled to a foreign country where he has been convicted of another crime, is still seeking.
Before it is sent, the lawmakers have no choice but to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: for my children, I would agree with a lot more
In the opera of the new construction arm of the opera "Love and Death in Vernon" the most intimate artists of the country are spreading.
Inga Valinskienė is joined by an artist's team, who has been entrusted with one of the most important works of art - a woman who is known to play the Jüllėta zuhl.
A major part of the team also became Paul Meschköl, who will take care of the music of artists.
"I think love stories from Shakespeare's times have been created very beautiful, but "Romeo and Jjuljeta", to see, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will still stand for a long time in various stages.
It will be interesting to be one of these buildings," says I. Valinskienė about a new trial that has been brought to an end.
Although a well-known woman is well-known in the stage, she has not yet played a role in various performances or musicals.
"It's time to play Juliette already, you're kidding. I. Valinskienė.
- I must have accepted this offer in my own time."
In fact, the role of female characters in the Shakespeare drama is not less important, some critics even consider it to be the most important.
The victim is not only an intermediary, an assistant - her method and speech tone, a woman’s attitude toward feelings and therefore solidarity with the intermittent wear gives more and more other colors.
Also important is the fact that she is one of the only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The victim's character in my way and style is not very friendly, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Creating a different character than having itself is a very part of the creative process.
Before I know what the final outcome will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation, says I. Valinskienė and reveals that, as part of Juliet's career, it would probably be the same.
- I think the uncle listened to his heart.
That's what most women do.
I'd probably do that."
The legendary opera "Love and death in Verona" is created according to the famous drama "Romeo and Juljeta".
The creation, in fact, tells the tragic end of the love story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.
The tragic end of history is clear from where the conflict between young families - Monteki and Capulets has arisen.
"All the time the whole story is possible.
There will always be parents who have acted against their children’s choice.
Only today's solutions to such problems - the opposite - are asked whether Rome and Juliet's history can be repeated today, says future Professor I. Valinskienė.
- On behalf of my children, I would agree with many as well as with the marks."
The actor and director of Ramón Cicán's major opera in the Roman and Julljetos is the role of Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justina Jarutis, also in the scene will also appear in the Vidas Bareikis, Kūstutis Cicáns, Mindaugas Papingis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulus Sinkūnas and Aidas Barukuskas.
The latest construction of the opera "Love and Death in Vernon" will be delivered to the auditor at the end of December.
The first new coloured legendary creation was created on 28 December for the viewers of Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
The day after December 29th, the hand opera will be shown in the "Fourth" arena of Klaipeda.
E. Jankuskas announced with which footballers will finish the tournament at the National level
The Lithuanian football team trainer Edgar Jankuskas announced the composition of the national team to the UEFA National Championships with Romania and Serbia on 17 and 20 November.

Later, however, the prospective career of the football player stopped suffering.
After two years of suspension, another representative of Kaunas Žalgirio was invited to attend the assembly.
In October, the tragedy of the nation's war with Romania and Montenegro was brought to an end, after defeating the warriors Egidius Vaitkūn and Edwin Girdvinis.
"We will try to find the first points in the League of Nations, even though it is waiting for a very difficult time in the fields of twin-square.
In the homes, we lost the minimum difference between Serbians and Romanians.
It's a failure and a success.
We hope the guests will be able to wake up.
Although this is a matter for the passengers, it is crucial to fight for the first place in the group and the possibility of continuing the fight on the road to the European Championship," said the Lithuanian electoral trainer E.Jankauskas.

"Skamp" presents a song that the video clip has already refused to show one TV
This year, the team "Skamp" has been busy building music for 20 years.
On 26 December, the unique public concert "Skamp20" in Vilnius "Siemens" was announced in the arena.
This time it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a beautiful video clip.
"This creation is about love, so I thought that the climate should be replaced by all kinds of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," explains Eric Jennings, who is convinced that any reference to homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
The new "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" video clip filmed over ten different orientations and ages: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and we hope that one day we won't have to discuss it," said Victor Diawar, who created the music of art at the beginning of the year during family vacation in Israel.
True, because of this video, Skamp has already been able to cope with negative reactions - he is not trying to show one of the most popular characters in the country.
That's a lot to say about our society.
Television won't show because people are staring at it and it's not an inappropriate content for children.
And is it that any televisions that come in every morning can be stored on screens and other examples of violence? "Retroactively asked E. Jennings.
Erica and Vilnius Alessius said: "You should see more people with more hands in touch and care, regardless of their social status, sex or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment where there is more tolerance and less tolerance.
The new music and the video clip we want to explain our audience's day at least a little bit and give them a smile."
The Skamp group has been listening from 1998 to loud music lyrics that spoke in non-popular or opium themes.
The best of all groups - the old and new - the loud and wide singing of the "Skamp20" concert in Vilnius "Siemens" arena on December 26th.
It expects everyone with their families, and children up to 10 years of age are free of charge.

Presidency: LRT is not a political property
In order to bring the Commission's conclusions back into line with the LRT, the Presidency insists that the rulers are merely trying to get more political control over the social translucency.
"The public broadcaster is non-political property, and the fundamental principle is this independence from politics," explained President Mindaugas Lingė.
However, the consultant pointed out that the opposition process can be taken into account at this time.
"It can be seen that these (political. - ELTA) effects want to have more.
And we appreciate that enough criticism," said Mr. Lingė.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission operating in the Seima are quavetonary and questionable legality, as they apply to the independence of the broadcaster.
While Mr Lingä stressed the need to improve the management of the LRT, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and through the search for specific aspects that hinder the operation of the LRT.
He stressed that the international authorities are now stressing that the LRT should be monitored, not by the political authorities, but by the competent authorities.
On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the Commission examining the activities of the LRT.
These conclusions have raised many criticisms.
The very sceptic assessment of proposals to change the management of the LRT is to reduce the powers of the Council and to appoint its members with the mandates of the appointing authorities.
In view of this concern, the European Union has expressed concern.
The opposition Group of the Seima members called on the Constitutional Court to examine whether the Special Parliamentary Commission was not opposed to the Constitution.
Working abroad - good news from R. Karbauski
The Seimas began to consider the amendment of the Law on the Place of Life, submitted by Mr Ramón Karbauski, of the Group of the Lithuanian States and the Green Union, to exempt citizens from the payment of compulsory health insurance premiums.
Following the draft presentation, 56 Seimas members joined, and 25 parliamentarians attended before it was 9, respectively.
Following the discussion of the draft opinion at the plenary meeting of the Seimas, the Seimas decided to request the Government's conclusions on 6 December.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation shall be exempt from payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Living and working in non-Lithuania, in accordance with the procedures laid down by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund (‘Sodra’) and the State Tax Inspection procedure, shall be deemed to have been issued from Lithuania.
It's about services that people don't use.
It looks at the additional possibility of fixing that man has gone away," explained Mr. Karbauski from the Seima tribe.
Such a proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservatory of the Seima, Antana Matulo, would be unjust in respect of citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Dalis is using it for Lithuanians living abroad," observed A. Matulas.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss believes that this is how we call on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, assumptions would be made for the free use of the health protection system.
Following the adoption of the proposed legislative amendment, for persons who have moved to another country, social insurance benefits are paid, free of charge, the burden of the administration of Sodros debt.
At present, citizens of Lithuania who have actually left Lithuania, but in accordance with the procedure laid down in the legislation do not have a declaration of entry into the Register of Livestocks, are charged monthly to compulsory health insurance (PSD) and, if they are not paid, the debt is collected.
A. Data obtained on fraud, but justified on fraud
The Vilnius Court of Appeal remained in force for a decision on the reason for the failure of the judgment of the former former known athlete Alvyd Daone, but it was justified on the basis of the documents being circulated.
On the first day, the court's debt was incurred immediately.
A. Done at Brussels, for a period of six and a half years, the sentence shall be imposed by way of imprisonment.
This year, the city’s district district court was executed by a multi-time Lithuanian skirmish.
It was sentenced to a half-year term of imprisonment.
On the basis of the case under appeal, Vilnius District Court dismissed one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay almost EUR 760 for the Crimes Fund.
Procurator A. Daonėl claimed that in 2013, he shared a campaign that his former wife, Dalia Burocaitė, had loaned 200 thousand litres (about 58 euros).
It was only in 2016 that the wedding learned about it when it was invited to cover the funeral.
An ex-wife told a man that he had never been pregnant and had never had cancer.
In the case, there are no objective data from the judges of the Vilnius District Court that prove that A. Daonėla would have recorded the facts that it is not the UAB "Dalesia" that is owed to A. Daonėlai 200 thousand litres.
In accordance with the arguments of the judge and his defence, the case does not contain supporting objective data.
In this way, when it was found that A. Daonėla had only used a true document to cover and acknowledged that these signs - the use of a broken document - are a complex part of fraud (in the case of fraud), A. Daonėla was justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Penal Code, without showing that he was involved in criminal proceedings," says the Vilnius Court of Justice.
The fireman led the land under siege - he heard the book for three days
As reported by the Kaunas District Anti-Fraud Management Board, a report has been received that three days of smoking is prohibited after the change in heat pipelines.
When the fire broke out, he also heard a cat's book.
It is clear that a few days ago, heat trace repair work was being carried out here.
It is estimated that two chains could have been on the ground during the crossing.
In the fire, the heat trajectory, which was located at the foot of the semi-medium, was used to dry out the soil for the cats.
The son of Antonino Scalia claims that his father did not observe liberal protests about Kavanaugh
On Sunday, Justice Antonino Scalia told Fox News that his father would not be surprised by the protest of patriotial forces against the appointed Judge, Brittany Kavanaugh, because Scalia believed that the Supreme Court was overextending the needs of the modern world.
"In general, it would not be a great shock to be appointed to the Supreme Court, as many of those who are based on Roe's pre-Wade case – at least they are already so positive," said Christopher Scalia, referring to the 1973 case, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was confirmed in certain trimesters.
Roe was one of the above-mentioned countries' right to regulate abortions on its own, and some countries, in response to this decision, tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe was actually trying to solve cultural problems, even though they had to be resolved through elections and the legislative process," he added in a presentation entitled "Fox & Friends".
"In an effort to speed up the process, the Supreme Court has added further harm, so nominations to the Supreme Court and the dispute on approval have led to a marked response, as the judges have a role to play in law-making."
The Secretary-General of the Republic of Nebraska, Ben Sasse, expressed a similar opinion at this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that Congress has often given too much power to the executive authorities that are not really accountable, and has left some bureaucratic issues to the Supreme Court, so that the judges have to take a job that the senators have rejected.
The capital police arrested and accused hundreds of protesters of illegal rape in the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid an adverse reaction due to unconfirmed sexual misconduct that he had committed decades ago, Scalia said that she would soon be unable to avoid sadness.
In response to the statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court, because on the fourth day during the senator's hearing, he reacted angrily and sometimes – the pressure, Scalia wondered whether all the judges were well-deserved.
"The judges don't get tired of it," Skya said, talking about the minor disagreements that sometimes occur in cases of opposition.
'Tissa, Judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but this was different circumstances.
He tried to hide his good name from unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, the Senate Court Committee (11 to 10) allows the majority of the votes of the party to participate in the entire Senate vote.
Senator Jeffas Flake of the Arizona Republics made a dramatic announcement at the moment that his decisive vote would be delivered to Kavanaugh only if the FTB would be given a week to investigate the current alleged crimes committed by Kavanaugh.
The investigation continued, and President Trumpas said that the agency had broad powers and could ask "what had been planned".
Schiaparelli in the collection of ready clothes – fantastic works
Is Surrealism Possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris fashion houses, which were built almost a century ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented their first collection of ready clothes and handcuffs.
Fantastines, and not wearing prepared clothing for a favorite brand, this collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsos Schiaparelli style of cotton.
The excentrical image of a long - split model house has now appeared and is very modern.
In Esther’s decisions, you will find compassion, compassion, heart, and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination in 1930, and he was the first designer to be seen by models in music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali decided to harmonise me and me, and now Calvinis Klein and Rafa Simons, co-operated with American poet Sterling Ruby.
The legend is that Dali, together with Schiaparelli and the mother of the omora, wanted to throw out a real Mayon, but did not accept it.
Black wore without glasses with Mano Ray'au's design "Electricité" on the desk.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is not different from the history of Schiaparalli," said Bertrand Guyon, a member of the construction director of the house in Vandomo district for the last three years.
He supported the collection of ready-made clothing, supported the Schiaparalli in his friendship with Manu Ray and, in cooperation with the Mano Ray'aus Fund, created clothing in accordance with the well-known art works.
The image of the artist's eye-matched "Sticles" is shown on the trails of Perspex and the red holes from the "Observator's Time: Instincts" on the right side of the sleigh will be painted with a collage.
My Ray'aus "Sticky Shoes" on the collection trails
One of Elso's changes was an attractive picture of the scene S. Her company color – "Scattering rose" inspired her "Scattering" angles.
The first piece of Guyon "Schiaparelli" hand with a string on the right is called "Pasqatis".
Their retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
Last evening, a temporary shop opened in a warehouse on the left side of the old coast, showing a Syrianist side of the Paris fashion week and for 100 € was possible to acquire Virgilo Abloho's properties from the soon-showing Ikea collection.
After half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloho's officers were on the line, without delay buying one of his creative favorites, rather than his men's clothes, Louis Vuitton.
This project helps to achieve a wider audience than it can be made available to the deaf man or designers to create the furniture.
“No one has any property, but knowledge of a certain place can help to start a conversation at the southern table.
This is what he has been thinking about for a thousand years," he recently said.
The audience in the sea area realized that the event in this garage would not be normal when the models began to run for them on wheels.
The collection of men and women's colourings of men and women's colourings was supported by Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabula, designer of Westwood.
Some women (and a number of men) who had been in the semicircuit shelters were on their way, but the snowy high platforms were on their own.
Westwood, watching the show in the first row and holding the collection with the horse’s motives and the orange in the chest, joined her to her husband, who gave her the flower garden.
Strong links in photos
Detroite was born and Peter Zelewski, who lived in London, was already confirmed as a street photographer when he started to photograph two years ago.
"As a photographer and people, I always dreamed of two and strange relationships that everyone was talking about," he said.
The photographer did not intend to create the whole project, but he said, "after I got the first two portraits, I got the independence and there was no way back."
The book of Zelewski will soon print 44 identical pictures and stories.
This project is more visual, he says: "This is not a document or a scientific project – I wanted to photograph the effects and sensitive portraits of people."
Servants have expressed doubts in the professional union, taking into account the wage negotiations
Members of the Royal Service College, who were not satisfied with the professional union deal with the National Health Service on salaries, after the vote, expressed a lack of confidence in the Union and challenged it by excavating the requirements for the increase in the amount expected.
This unprecedented decision was adopted after the discussions held at the Royal Service College, when its former Secretary-General Janet Davies wrongly admitted to having promised members that their salaries this year would increase by 3 per cent once a 1 per cent tax restriction has been lifted.
Not long after the expected salary was paid, the members arrested and forced David to resign from office, then filed a petition, and on Friday the meeting was held in Birmingham, after which he appealed to the College Council for mistrust.
"The sincere and open debate in Birmingham has helped to clarify relations, and the college has only been strengthened," said the director of the Royal Service College, Maria Trewern.
"The Council of the Royal College of Services and the management of the information sent to it was very clear.
In recent weeks, the Council has already tried to make changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to and include members; we will continue to try to implement this."
The meeting will take place next week, and it is expected that the members of the Kingdom Service Board will be invited to attend.
"The basis of the service is trust," said the national health service servant to the Guardian newspaper.
‘The activities of the Royal College of Service have undermined confidence, and the Council must therefore withdraw.
I hope that she will be honored and will listen to the request.
It is interesting that other members of the trade unions will also pursue a reform."
In the National Health Service, the State official of the Joint Professional Union, Rachel Harrison, said to the Guardian: "I am grateful that the National Health Service staff from all countries understood the expected failure.
It caught them."
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the Royal Service College acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the 2018 negotiations on remuneration and had informed them in advance.
However, it is also argued that the Royal College of Services campaign on the abolition of tax restrictions forced the government to reject this restriction and to promise to increase payments by 6.5 per cent in three years.
The vote was held after an independent study, which found that the college was ready to open the negotiations and Davies was accused of insufficiently assessing the transaction.
It is claimed that the Royal College of Services provided information that does not match the facts, so the members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College published conflicting information on whether all employees would receive a 3% increase in wages.
In the report before the collapse of the college, representatives were wrongly alleged to have planned “3% increase and increase in progress in the implementation of the reform”.
In fact, the wage had to be gradually increased to 3% and only some of the largest employees receiving the wage would have been expected to increase immediately.
‘Nearly all the information provided to the members on the implementation of the transaction was incorrect (mostly because it was tried to simplify it),’ said the representative of the Electoral Reform Service.
‘The ERA considers that the decision-makers did not understand and clearly explain the differences between the existing systems and the proposed transaction and did not clearly specify the main advantages, including the 6.5% and 29% figures mentioned during the campaign, so it was not possible to adopt a reasoned decision.’
78 per cent of the votes cast, while 3.74 per cent of the members of the Royal Service College participated in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan joked "Instagram" direct translucency viewers trying to "get" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was critical of the direct transliteration of Instagram, in which she followed the Benjamin family and tried to separate the sons from the parents.
In the beginning, direct transmissions, almost filmed in Moscow (according to Lohan’s earlier update on the Instagram history), the actor offered to prepare a place for the family at night, but the situation quickly became complicated.
"Good to all! I want to show the family I met," she said to the onlookers, "that's the refugees from Syria, I'm very worried about them.
They really need help.
Would you like to come with me?
“ I’ll take care of you, ” she said to the family before turning to one of the children, “Would you like to spend the night at the hotel?
Watch movies?
It would be hard to watch a movie on television or on the computer."
After his parents left, Lohan reacted in a way that was contrary to him.
“Your children shouldn’t be on the road, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them houses and a place of night, as I am now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't worry about me."
When the family tried to get out of Lohan on the street, the actor followed her directly through the Instagram.
“See what you’re doing – it’s a child’s trade. So you’re making an Arabic culture.
You'll drive children, even if they don't want to go with you.
Bernie, don't worry, I'm with you and now I see all the world."
The transition ended the physical confrontation – it seems that her mother broke Lohan.
The clips of the video record appeared in the social media, and some users wondered whether this could not be compared to the test.
The Independent met with Lohan's representative for comments.
A third of the British people think they'll never pay for all the debts they have.
Almost one third of Britain believes that they will not be able to cover their debts during life, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, which revealed only “The Independent”, showed that the British, in particular belonging to the 18-24-year-old group, believe that all life will have debts, and only half of them expect to leave them.
In recent years, a report published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies shows that research remains at around 46,000 loans for students who have completed their studies and that the poorest students remain under more than 57,000.
Most graduates (81 per cent) will never pay all their debts, so the first 30 years of work will be under pressure.
Public loans increase: According to data from the National Statistics Department, the United Kingdom family debt is recorded and the United Kingdom spends over $900 per year on average more than employment.
However, is it worth any concern about this harmful statistics?
Are all age - threatening debts just a new way of life for young adults (and for all society)?
As an example, the car that is another steam buyer can be sold after buying houses (if such success is achieved).
Auto Trader has predicted this week that all new cars will be transported smoothly over the decade – this will be the usual way to acquire vehicles.
Director of EQ Investors and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believes that expectations have indeed changed.
"At these times it is really normal to have loans: credit cards have been popularized, interest rate refinance, student loans and rapid credit," she said.
"Our elders have sometimes been able to have schools."
At this time, student loans and future prices have become a normal phenomenon.
This claim is also supported by Moira O'Neill, head of the Personal Finance Section of the Interactive Investor, who believes that the results can lead to anxiety.
“If you borrow a large amount that exceeds your income four or five times, it may prove that the additional debt is not needed”, she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so large loans or other debts must be considered as a matter of urgency."
It may not be necessary to monitor that the comments made by the financial industry do not give rise to any doubts.
Brian Brodie, director of the Freedom Finance loan agency, says: "The debt is not taboo.
The loan for the repair of the house or the new car shall not be paid for the last departure.
Because of low interest rates, many people have contributed to the long-term deposits from which a larger return is received, but it is not so easy to get saved money.
As a result, the middle class is growing.
Over the past six months, about half of new loans have been received by customers with great credit rating."
Richard Haymess, head of the TDX Group's financial solution section, believes that such expectations — not to get out of debt — really lead to anxiety.
He says: “Inflation was the largest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates fell, and employment increased slightly, so many people do not take credit for their decision not to have a realistic plan to return to school.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of banknotes will increase by 17 per cent, and the main factor is a record of consumer debt."
The debt may not be much of a matter of concern to a person’s work and employment, but it is not clear how a lifelong commitment will affect his well - being in the old age.
The study of the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out together with the funding lending for replaced assets from More 2 Life, showed that the unencumbered debt of 55-74 people has increased more than three-thirds over the past four years, i.e. more than twice the country's average.
This age group tends to climb through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than work.
Boyle added: “All more people in the 55 ’ s choose to pay a loan from pension funds, and this will affect their living in retirement.
Most often it is the unit's reserves which they 're obliged to keep'.
In addition, people believe that using wealth will lead to a fall in the way of wealth later, but changed assets will not gain as much money as expected.
If the price gap is high, this situation will only be difficult."
Dr. Serena Williams invented "I Touch Me" to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video recording in which she plays the classic "Divinyls" song "I Touch Myself" with a heavy chest.
Tennis’ eyes split the click on his Instagram page and explained that the video was created in order to encourage women to check the chest itself.
"This month of fighting heart cancer, I wrote The Divinyls, I Touch Myself, to remind women to check on themselves regularly," William wrote.
“So I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do this because this problem affects women of all races all over the world.
Most important of all, it helps to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of that."
William continued: “This music clip is part of the I Touch My Own Project, which is being implemented by the famous Chrissy Amplett – she died from heart cancer and gave us her emergency to remind women of her health first."
The project is supported by the “BCNA” trademark Berlei for breast cancer Network Australia (BCNA) which was launched in 2014 after the death of Amphlett.
The video recording, published by the tennis star in its Instagram section, has gained more than 1.5 million reviews and lots of circuses for how the tennis player made the sound.
"You'll be ashamed of this trick and your courage to do it.
Thank you, Serena," said one honourable man.
Another added: “Serena, it’s NOOSTABU.
Twenty years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and I had to wait until my mammograms showed up.
It's just necessary to verify.
Thank you for not afraid to leave the comfort zone - you're a real hero!"
The Berlei project I Touch My Own Project also released a new red letter entitled The Chrissy, which was inspired by the star.
100 percent of the profits obtained from the sale of olive oil will be awarded to BCNA.
When checking for yourself, it is important to know what signs and symptoms need to be searched.
Signs of heart cancer are not only small, but also changed heart size or shape, tastes or tastes, excluding spinal cord, skin surface disorders, permanent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, cancer can be prevented by exposure to urticaria or racculosis, swelling of the veins, and swelling of the spinal cord.
Women are recommended to check their breast every month.
After observing any signs of heart cancer, NHS recommends immediate contact with a family doctor.
If your family doctor decides that your symptoms need to be further evaluated, he will take you to a heart cancer clinic.
Adam Driver gave the entire SNL film group a quatto
Adams Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" Christmas star and actually tried to impress everyone.
The best broadcasts are usually not related to a specific current event – like a new exhibition called “Karjeros Day”.
The U.S. middle school day is seen when students take their parents away, and adults of Mortdecais (Peter Davidson) do not want to agree that his father, old oil magnetist Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), would speak the language.
In Lazdele, Parnassus, whose megalomanic personality was able to inspire Daniel's Day-Lewis actor Daniels Plainview from the film "Bis Blood", describes how he destroyed the oil industry.
“I was born seven months ago,” says Parnassus to students.
"Incubator technologies were just exposed, so I was put into a garden and warm in a pike before I learned to walk.
My bones didn't change, but not my spirit!
Be strong and rejoice in your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actor, Aidy Bryant, who are playing the teacher, simply doesn't feel comfortable and can't see the driver in the eye.
However, the post of the Star War actor is only running and he starts to talk about a personal war with another oil magnet H. R. Pickins.
"I've got your ring!" he cried out.
"I have filled her womb with my profuse seeds, and I have cursed your young man: this is my final dream, H. R.!"
The trainer in less than five minutes became the same reminder of Adam's driver's character as Kyle Renas from two films.
"Be cursed, H. R.!"
Kendricko Lamaro songs recorded on the Internet show eight unheard of works
It looks like there's been a lot of unexplained Kendrick Lamar songs.
On the sixth day, eight more unheard of works that were inspired by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay's Rock, Isaah Rashad and Abi Soulas.
It is not clear where the music comes from, and also what is called "Bad Kid Chill City EP" and the above illustration (which was most recently created by the honorary) is not official.
It may be that only the demonstration and endless music versions, which thus resembled, are recorded in different Lambar's careers.
"Gang Member" could belong to "Good Kid Maad City" and "Heroin", composed together with SZA, similar to the sound tone "DAMN./Black Panther".
The following songs shall be distributed in the collection:

Game about the music "Chikaga": No tickets will be left in Klaipeda, inviting you to go to Vilnius or Kauna
Lithuanians want to see the music of the National Music Theater, Chikaga, of Klaipėda State.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musicians of all time have spent another content in the largest country arena.
However, some 1.5 months before the show, the halls have to be built.

Talenting and from TV screens is a well-known actor in Chicago who will move the irrecoverable Billy Flynnn - the best and most powerful lawyer in Chicago, without changing people's lives.
Since the music of the public music theatre "Chikaga" is adapted to larger areas, arenas, its artistic status is also greater than the art shown in Broadway.
In Lithuania, Chikago has a wife showing half of the artists.

The website can be called a representative area of the house where we allow time with friends, welcome visitors, and so it should be set up so that it is pleasant not only for the living room or the family but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, ceilings, family shoes should be selected.
The website should be not only beautiful but also comfortable.
The best way to get to help is to get the interior designer, which will help you optimally fill the area so that it will not be overloaded or rewinded - too empty.
In particular, it is recommended to set the main site point, i.e. the other details to which you will link the links.
This may be a bold or other important accent on the website.
It would also be good to create a chat area where guests can enjoy a pleasant conversation so as not to be disturbed by local dishes and teasings.
Sofos, the seats should be set aside for each other so that your guests can attend and speak.
Thus, the composition of the balls should promote communication, unite people, and not distance them from each other.
Do not stand outside the wall.
Depending on the size of the room, the distance should be from the wall.
Even if the room is small, still stay at least a few places from the wall, don’t take the balls away from it.
If the room is large, leave more space from the wall.
Actually, the higher the distance, the better.
Create a balance sheet by drawing the sheets
Consider the various details that will be available on your website.
All elements must be intertwined.
The websites should be aligned with the interior details.
Possible low contrast.
It will remain in the website, but it should not be too large, as the interior will become inexhaustible.
We would always be asked to look at the interior designers.
When creating a site interior, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you are at risk of retreating to the crater: or you will create an interior because you are afraid to experiment, break, choose inappropriately or persist in improvised.
Adequate lighting
This is especially important.
A different light reveals a different area.
The lighting shall be displayed at different levels: lamp lamps, wall lights, on stairs built with light.
The Prosecutor examined the justified decision of the Heads of the LKF
The District Court of Vilnius condemned the judicial decision of Vilnius to the former Heads of the Lithuanian Corps Federation (LKF).
As the prosecutor reported on the first day, the complaint indicates that the municipality of Panevažia had no legal basis for contributing to the reconstruction of the municipality's private hotel in Panevažy.
A preliminary study found that in 2010 a public procurement and sale contract was concluded between the municipalities of the Lithuanian Corps Federation and the city of Panevažia, in order to find an opportunity to finance the reconstruction of the hotel.
The prosecutors claim that the services to be provided by the federation to the municipality of the city of Paneväži under the said contract could not be provided without delay and could not be provided, since the provision of services was already provided or provided for by the State and the funding of the sponsors, part of the planned events had already occurred before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out of other funds, and part of the events had already occurred after the publication of the invoices of VAT - money according to the invoices had been transferred for non-conformal events.
In the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the District of Vilnius argues that the State itself has committed itself to the municipality of the city of Panevažia to undertake a private reconstruction of the municipality, since no State obligation for a particular hotel was made, only the proposal to the municipality of Panevažia to address the issues of the development of the hotels required for the campaign was made as soon as possible.
In the Court’s view, the Court found it unreasonable that the heads of the municipalities of the LKF and Paneweži tried to carry out a State obligation without having the legal means, since the data available in the case showed that it was possible to organize the movement of the European team in other cities without violating the laws.
The District Court of Vilnius calls for the annulment of the Court of First Instance's ruling on appeal and in this case a new decision on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On 15 October, the Vilnias District Court fully condemned all crimes committed by the General Secretary-General of the LKF in Mindauga Balchiun.
This was related to the preparation of the European Men's Corps Championship held in Lithuania in 2011.
Mr Balchiun was accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecutor-General of the LKF stated that he had agreed with the Federal Finance Officer and Executive Director to include, on behalf of the federation, the documents of transfer and other financial documents and the services provided to the municipality of Panjesz, in addition to the official accounts, the financial documents and the services provided by the LKF.
According to the judicial investigation carried out by the officials of the Special Research Service (STT), the resources of the municipality of Paneväži could be around and covered by documents for LKF and later used for the reconstruction of the "Romantic" hotel of Viia Unica.
The head of this hotel, Dalia Kuklierienė, was accused of buying - it is suspected that she gave the television as a gift to Mr. Balchiun.
Everyone with Mr. Balchiun is trying to justify himself.
The charges in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Corps Federation.
Original location of work - tarsi Bermuda Tricampis
In Lithuania, the number of people who have lost or died since 1992 has already exceeded the total number of inhabitants of the city of Alyta has reached 83 000.
If the physical workplace and its safety requirements are met and clear, it will become the choice of a new Bermuda tripod to work away from home, public space or even other countries.
Although the Safety and Health Safety Specialists claim that the Law provides for remote work for workers from the safety and health conditions of other workers in the company, the diversity of modern forms of work may lead to a number of issues, as reported in the press.
In the event of an accident in the apartment, for the first two working days, 80 per cent of compensation is paid by the employer, and for the rest of the period, "Sodra".
If it is found that an accident took place at work, Sodra will pay 100% of the wage since the first day of unemployment.
The evaluation of the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspection and the BTA is of the view that the majority of accidents and various injuries at work occur at work.
Often these are various physical works where the risk of injury is higher: they are not treated with devices or equipment, losing concentration or coordination.
However, even the offices where most of the most demanding, best paid specialists are faced with the challenges that employers face and the freedom of mobility of workers is very popular," says the head of the BTA Human Resources Management Division, Jevgenija Kristjunė.
It is recommended that the legislation in force in Lithuania clearly regulate the duties and responsibilities of the employee, define the time, place and functions of the work, and that it is effective and in a far-reaching way.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred during work or not.
Situations and innovations are indeed diverse, each case being individualized.
Employees are often heard about the fact that the employer is responsible when we wait to or from work or when we travel to or from work because of accidents at work.
However, in this case, there are very few skills and expenses, so I would encourage both workers and employers to start conversations, to understand and to make the most of it clear and acceptable to both parties what situations are really considered to be an accident at work and which will already have the status of housing trauma," the specialist advises.
J. Christian says that during these times when working functions are often entirely sufficient for a computer and mobile phone and a stable Internet connection, the employee does not need to work at the place specified in the agreement and at the time specified.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work today not at home but by making coffee in a coffee shop or a park while enjoying the sun.
It's gonna be a job, isn't it?
What if the hours under discussion are not yet in line with the agreement?
It can be very difficult to cope with very different situations that help explain the circumstances of the investigation initiated by Sodros or State Labour Inspections, - a positive specialist.
According to them, the main difference in financial terms between the event's work and the amount of unemployment benefit is the difference.
J. Christian acknowledges that there was an informal hearing of minors, while employers are trying to conceal the true circumstances of accidents or trauma and try to persuade workers to ask doctors not to work, to take responsibility for themselves, thus reducing financial burden.
This is unfair, disrespectful attitude towards the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: this is also a civil liability insurance against injury to workers, accident prevention from injury, disability or even death," says J. Kristian.
The mobile signature system is running again
After the launch of the first day in Lithuania, the BNS approved the service provider's representatives "SK ID Solutions" from Estonia IT.
This company reported the disturbances on Monday morning, the inconveniences experienced by the companies "Bitė", "Telia" customers and the share of "Tele2" consumers.
The difficulties to be fixed in Estonia too, but the representatives of SK ID Solutions were unable to comment on the situation in that country.
Lithuanian Regbio collection - Polish tuition
European ‘Trophy’ dividends owe to the Lithuanian Regbio collection as long as it is difficult to be equal to the top-level dividends.
The ‘Trophy’ division in the Old Land is the third in terms of capacity after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
Here's a 13-18 rating land command.
The Lithuanian fleet began to sail across the north at 30:10 against the command of the Czechs.
And last week the Lithuanian public library in Lodja, where it is not connected to the Polish collection - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were slow to fight, the fundamentals often violated the rules, and the Polish regimes were forced to move ahead with their efforts.
3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of execution was carried out by Wojciech Piotrwičus, giving his own 12 points weight.
In the first column, the Lithuanians had to play without the yellow card received from Tautwyl.
On the second floor, visitors gathered a number of attacks, but they were not able to finish them successfully.
At that time, the Greeks were able to defeat our defenses.
The impact of the camouflage in the reading area was performed by Mateuszas Plichta, and later by Christan Pogorzelski and Matteus Adamski.
In addition to several important players, the Lithuanian electorate trainer from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantage of the hunters and said that such teams had given much valuable experience.
"The lines played very well and dominated all the game components.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in these hopes.
What we just put into this higher level is that we have to understand it.
We won the first rounds before the checks, but now we agreed with the very powerful hunters and had to acknowledge their advantage.
The Polish electorate has provided us with valuable lessons," said a PAR specialist, who has been standing for four years at the Lithuanian collective train station.
Another round "Trophy" Lithuanian division played on 6 April 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
This division is still underway by the Dutch and Swiss commanders.
José Blazión became the Minister of Culture's adviser
The Minister of Culture, Lian's Minister of Culture-Johnsson, started working in the Juozapas Blažion.
J. Blažyun, Minister of the Council of Archives, Library, Museums and Cultural Heritage, was notified by the Ministry.
J. Blažijūn, who graduated from the University of Vilnius's Academy of Sciences, has so far been the director of the literature and art archives of Lithuania, professor of the Museum of Communication at Vilnius University.
According to the report, the Minister's adviser is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and values conservation.
Japan’s coastal archipelago has sought the most densely populated islands
Esanbe Hanikata Kojima - such a name was given in 2014 to a very small island in northern Japan.
A small, fertile and priceless island, which was essentially inappropriate for life, was very important for Japan.
Is it so important that she now has a rich territory that is full of sight - perhaps still going on?
Why does Japan so need this island?
It won't happen.
It is likely that ice and ocean currents have visited this island for a long time, although it is still very recently above the surface of the water area nearly two meters.
It is almost beyond doubt that the island is simply frozen, but at least its feet are expected to be found.
When the island began, no one knew exactly what it was - it was so wild that nobody was too much of it and not hungry.
Most likely the first ones to learn about Esanbe Hanikata Kojima were Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as a means of visual navigation.
Their extinction is not even a tragedy for these fish, as there are better ways to catch where fish can be caught and where Russian waters begin to fight.
That was the case with Esanbe Hanikata Kojima.
This drying soil was the very night of Cyrus ’ conquest.
This island border, which Russia calls the Kurillas Islands, and Japan - the Northern Territories.
The conflict with these obstacles continued from the middle of the 19th century, but at the age of 20.
There are natural resources in these areas, but Japan has historically believed that the islands should belong to it.
The need for Japan to explore these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They first made the map, took more detailed studies, and recorded many small islands.
The agreements between Japan and Russia signed in 1855 indicated that the latter were in line with Sakhalin and that Japan was all the islands of the Kurillas.
So these two states were born until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sakhalin to Japan.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and extended the island of Kuril.
Japan, in all, does not mean large claims on the whole island, although it was the first, but it would like to have four islands - Europe, Kunashi, Shikotan Islands and Chabomayas.
Japan feels that it has a historic right because the island has experienced the first, and it belongs to Japan in accordance with the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan invited Russia to share these four islands at a level, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is almost as close to the Northern Territories as it is to the island of now starting this geographical link is lost.
Dingo is a physical sign of Japan's presence in those waters.
This is a huge loss, so the rest of the island is searched for.
However, even after they have been found by Esanbe Hanikata Kojima, they will not comply with the simple definition of the island - that must be dry.
This means that Japan's territory will gradually be reduced and the exclusive economic zone, calculated from the newspapers, will be reduced.
It's just interesting what the island's search mission looks like - it's really not going to be this late or late.
Unbelieving drama in the Lithuanian and Polish boxing contests
More than a week had to wait for the final judge's verdict, which became an inter-State meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish voters.
In Poland, nine Polish and Lithuanian twin were held.
Four of the prisoners won the Lithuanians, both the Lithuanians and the Polishs.
The final decision of the Chamber of Justice and the Bureau of Appeals, which had been held for a long time, led to the conclusion of the decision.
The election took place with the victory of the Lithuanian boxers.
The Lithuanian champion Marius Vishniauskas (the category of weight up to 52 kg) provided 3:0 defeated Jacob Surma, shortly after Edgar Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) defeated Radomir Ombudsnik.
Two families followed the victory: Damiana Durkaczas (up to 64 kg) 3:0 defeated Manta Duzin, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 called Simon Bany.
The weight of the Lithuanian collection was returned to Vytutas Balsy (up to 75 kg).
Titus 2:1 killed Bartosz Golebievsky.
In the second battle, Piotras Szczowkis (up to 81 kg) in the third round had a clear weight of Egypt's Kasmois and the result was again at 3:3.
He followed closely the brothers in Jokul.
Robert Jokulis (up to 91 kg) 3:0 killed Andrzejs Colton, and Arvydas Jokulis (over 91 kg) already had to acknowledge Adam Kuliko's advantage in the first round.
Most of the discussions took place between Tado Tamashausk (up to 91 kg) and Michael Soczynski's battle.
The publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting was completed more than a week.
One judge gave a victory to the band, two judges to Lithuania, but because of the technical error of one judge to Lithuania, a point was read to Mr Soczynski.
After a long debate, the victory was left for the Polish boxer 2:1.
At a meeting of the Lithuanian and Polish electoral councils, the outcome of the victory was 10:8 (now 2 points).
They were able to see the Lithuanians for the past defeat of the cross-country ski.
In 2015, at a meeting in Marijampoła, the Lithuanian boxing team won even five of the six battles and won the winner score 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian electoral leaders in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian Box Championship held in Chile on 14-17 November.
After the country's presidentship, a new Lithuanian box will be set up, which will bring glory to the country in the world and Europe's championships next year.
How does a bird determine which path to follow?
You already know that the dog's neck is very sensitive.
They may be infected with hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, some even detecting diseases by smell.
Very well - known and filmed dog breeds, but their work is much harder than you thought.
How do they determine what the master of the vineyard is?
In fact, this is something more difficult than you think.
The eight of the headings consists of three stages - the creation, the determination of the direction and the visibility of the heading.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, since it is difficult to decide what course to follow.
Because there are no different steps left over and over again, so their smell is not very different, is it?
Not at all.
The experiment described in the Oslo University study, published in 1990, during which the dog was brought to a 90-degree camp at the trajectory that was passed by man.
Tests to be performed on the neck and on the asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs have easily set a human course of action, even when they have been tried to expose them to premature rebirth.
Can you imagine what a difficult assignment this would be?
The difference between the immediate foot shape is very small and in time it decreases even further.
However, scientists say that this is not so much a change - dogs could say, and what part of the foot falls on the ground first.
This is because their door is an incredible tool.
Smegenis dominates the port responsible areas (as our smegenes dominates the regions responsible for the government).
Dogs have 125-300 million quap receptors.
In general, dogs' port is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret is even more important.
Scientists then performed analogous experiments and with the left foot, but it was much harder for dogs to follow them.
This is because binary cancers are not segmented as current human feet, so it is more difficult to isolate a different place for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of the port.
This title will most likely match the numbers.
The white whales follow hundreds of miles away, while the red whales swallow the animal for 30 km.
Private forests require the regulation of seizures
Minister of the Environment Kıstutis Navick will explain on Tuesday Seime about forest degradation.
At the end of the summer, the loss of a kilo of society is due to forests in the Labanoro regional park.
The harvest of these forests was stopped for the month.
The Minister has acknowledged that the studies of the victims of Labanore have shown that no serious violations have been committed.
However, the Ministry of the Environment has already introduced some restrictions, taking into account the proposal of the Working Group to strengthen forest management in forest-dependent forests.
The Minister hopes that other legislation that will adjust forest supply will be prepared by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are intended to be applied in the fields of State forests and private forest management.
Agnė Jjalavićė opened the strategy as it subjugated 170 thousand followers
You need to give people what they want, and at the same time get what you want, the LRT television series "Culturally with Nomeda" says Agnė Jjaelavicėtė.
On the basis of the style, she was able to cut down a huge amount of honor.
"From the beginning I've been attracted to a man's skin, I've been looking for myself, and it's better running after a while," says A. Jjalelavićėtė.
A. Jagelavicė has more than 170 thousand followers in his holiday assignment - she has achieved this number by using a certain strategy: "From the beginning, I've been attracted to the human race, and I've been looking for myself, running for a while after that stage for a while".
Stylist A. Jachelavicītė says that the uncertainty is not affected, so it shows its face as it is, the authenticity and ability to find the best way to present is the most important criteria for popularity in the social networks.
She notes that social networks do not leave any human culture, because many internalists turn away from them to say, "For example, there was a age in adolescence when I wanted to date and change everything - now I don't want to do that."
"Immortality is the most serious thing.
And there is a lot of this in social networks.
Feisbuke is less than an instagram," she says.
A. Jäjalavićėtė says a specific knowledge sent on social networks is about women's emancipation.
It also advertises the production of magazines and also takes into account the creation of them.
"I can't say that the blue magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know it's really a lot there.
I hope that my work has a lot of creative work, as well as purity.
I'm balanced - that's my target to those big numbers.
I don't want to live any longer.
Which is better to give people what they want, and firmly to get what they want," says A. Jagelavičita.
One of the most difficult events of youth is classical music concerts.
Their popularity has been suggested by some people throughout life: talking about successful, failure, life-threatening events that are so authentic.
In such a strategy, A. Jachelevićė offers to apply to all cultures.
According to them, without any use, without any promotion and showing certain values, there are no cultural opportunities.
"How does the teacher stand against the students - is there a chance?
If we don't do anything about how to present this song, we don't advertise it, we're going to do nothing.
When we're going to be real, and we're going to be the last reader - maybe someone's gonna change.
I've got one, one, one, one, three, and one, and already depends," she shares her views.
Three people were hit by a hurricane in Lithuania on the north coast of June
On the sixth day after the terrorist attack to the north of June, three people started searching in Alaska.
One man was saved after a five - day disaster, and the other three failed to find him.
The storm struck close to Lithuania’s coast, northwestern from June.
It was found that it was Airbus H125 on a long journey to Grand Prerij in Texas.
On Friday, 100 feet from the shore have been found.
According to Associated Press, one survivor was 14 years old.
It was reported that mild hypothermia had occurred, but there were no other problems.
We'll write two adults and two teenagers in the emergency room.
According to KTVA, David King (53 years), Josh Pepperdas (42 years) and Andrew Pepperdas (11 years).
It has been established that Pepperdas is the director of the "Davis Constructors & Engineers" construction company.
I don't know what's going on.
The National Transport Safety Council stated that the investigation had been initiated.
"I'm going to start with a firefight that was completely new, which only came from the factory, two adults and two adults," says a report from the defence officers on the basis of the CTVA.
It has been observed that the pilot has had 40 years of experience when flying fixed-wing planes and helicopters, including flights to Alaska.
According to the Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeffs Brodsky told his family that his friends “did not know the hope of a miracle.”
With the help of a wall guard, rescuers renewed their search on 17 February 2016 on Mount Nevis in Fort Viljame, Scotland, for the alpines who had been caught.
On the sixth day, three people were found in Alaska following the terrorist attack.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
President Kellyanne's counsela Conway revealed an experience of sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway recommended a sharp dispute between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and his defendant, Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway was surprised to discover that he himself had experienced sexual violence, and accused B. Kavanaugh of taking Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge charged with sexual harassment by ignoring the negative facts of the accused.
"I am deeply touched by sexual harassment and violence.
I also experienced sexual harassment," said Conway in the CNN Sunday series "State of the Union".
"I am a victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take'a Tapperis, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for it.
We must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said the news network must be a guide to Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in the state of Pennsylvania last week.
Conway also criticized the Senate's judicial committee because it was unable to eliminate former President Bill Clinton, who committed oral sex in his office and taught US people.
The hearing showed that the demonstrations of Kavanaugh and Ford split the U.S. society
The Americans disagree about the testimony of Bretto Kavanaugh and his lawyer Christine Blasey Ford – the prosecutor claims that the judge had sex with her when they were teenagers.
In view of the fact that Ford or Kavanaugh is a myth, the number is nearly doubled: 38 per cent of the respondents claim that Kavanaugh was the fastest or most skeptical of the exhibitions, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Court Committee listened to both of the parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Diane Fenstein with a detailed complaint to the judge.
After writing a letter, Ford and Kavanaugh said he was ready to speak to the committee.
According to the evidence, Ford said there was 100 percent true that at the beginning of the 9th decade, we tried to rape Kavanaugh, not another person.
In an emotionalized language, 51 - year - old women said that they felt civil service, so they could not go further.
"I'm very worried," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civil duty to tell me what happened when Bretta Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women’s allegations of sexual abuse, Kavanaugh said that “never had sex in high school, college or ever since”.
"All the way you tried to find something that would hinder you from voting for my appointment, it doesn't matter how realistic or dirty it is," he said.
"It's just the last minute of a smile."
The results of a survey conducted on June 27-28, YeuGov, during which 2607 people were interviewed, were not surprising: the various parties were divided: Democrats were more likely to believe in Ford (73 per cent) and the republics (74 per cent) in Kavanaugh (74 per cent), although Ford showed more faith in republics than in Kavanaugh – Democrats (14 per cent, compared to 11 per cent).
The "Body Worlds" exhibition creator, called "Daktar Death", wants to be updated and demonstrated in his own show
A German scientist who has invented plastics wants to become a permanent part of his "Body Worlds" show.
Guntheris von Hagens developed a innovative method that allows for demonstrators, cults and organs to demonstrate worldwide in the exhibition, entertainment and entertainment, and countermeasures.
After his death, 73 - year - old men told the people to burn him to become a permanent exhibit in the Body Worlds show, which will be opened this week in London.
“In that sense, this will be the end of his life’s work.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express my recognition and love,” said Angelina Whalley to the newspaper “The Observer”.
She said that the man had given strict instructions on what to do with his lion, and the whole process would end for about a year.
The brain, nerves and arteries must be removed and the body must be absorbed and built in the necessary position.
"He said to me, 'Angelina, it can warm me up to 25 degrees a year, but then you'll have to add your hand, otherwise I'll break it."
So, I'll be able to move for years, then I'll have to take it."
Then he, in the best case, will join the exhibition in London's fair of other bodies, with fixed positions of time, such as riding horses or playing cards.
Von Hagens was the first public flight in the United Kingdom during direct British television broadcasts (the first public flight over 170 years).
Since 1995, there have been more than 47 million people around the world in the "Body Worlds" exhibitions.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernalis, told the newspaper The Guardian that 100 percent of the exhibitions using about 28,000 square feet, were presented by people who “supplied because they wanted to help the living, to light them and help see possible problems”.
“We see and read so many terrible things that we are dying.
We will not avoid one of them, death is common to all of us, and I think that Body Worlds shows that there is no need to fear," Tabernalis said.
Ronaldo's lawyers criticize the court's claim for excavating charges
The Portuguese football star, Christian Ronaldo's lawyer, said on Friday that the German newspaper, which expressed a "explainly illegal" American claim that Ronaldo was excommunicated in 2009, would be brought to court.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christiana Schertzas, said that the article “Der Spiegel” was “an unacceptable private complaint” and that he will, by legal means, seek to pay the magazine to his client.
The statement was sent to the Reuters by Ronaldo's representative, Gestifate, in response to the request to comment on the five-day article “Der Spiegel” published on the Internet.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not automatically verify.
Der Spiegel first published charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world, Ronaldo won five times the title of the world’s best player.
This summer he moved to "Juventus" from "Real Madrid"; the Italian club refused to comment on the "Der Spiegel" statement.
The newspaper reported that the alleged exodus took place in the room of Las Vegas in June 2009 – this was said by Kathryn’s Mayor’s lawyer Leslie’s Mark’s Stovalla.
He told the newspaper that Ronaldo and Mayorg had not agreed with the court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for Ronaldo paid $375 000.
The station did not immediately respond to Reuters e-mails for comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls from the house.
However, Stovals told the newspaper Der Spiegel that he filed a civil complaint in order to cancel a confidentiality contract.
The Mayorg newspaper Der Spiegel said that the contract did not end, as it still feels the consequences of the night before nine years ago.
"I have experienced a serious crisis," she said "Der Spiegel".
‘And yet, the charge of expropriation.
I love him, and I blame myself for signing it."
Sustainable business ensuring creative independence
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
In the new White Paper published by the Association of Independent Creators today on the site of #selfpub3.0, the first time clearly explains how to join other entrepreneurs, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The independent creation of Orna Ross, which has already been recognised for the first time by one of the 100 most influential people, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why creators should be allowed by Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"Assessing trends, such as popularized personal brands, responsible for use and reading on mobile phones, along with digital license technologies, create very favourable conditions for business of manufacturers," says Ross.
However, only independent and creative thinkers and intelligent creatures who understand the value of intellectual property can take advantage of these options.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages the creation of a number of employment sources through websites that create conditions for successful release and media.
It is possible to work from direct sale, renumbered models, smart assistance, wide dissemination models and other sources of income, e.g. online training and related entity activities.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in different formats as wide as audiences using retail and other services.
The main objective of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage change of thinking and learn to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, is not necessarily transferred to another company, e.g. specialized publications or self-authorisation services provider.
According to Ross, manufacturers can thus increase their income, capacity and impact, and in these methods they must be concerned not only by every digital age creator, but also by the authors; it also stressed that true independence of artists (as well as others) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its perspective is now the best for independent creations.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes the computer release and printing according to the claim.
Self-Publishing 2.0 theme is the sale of books for e-book readers and telephones in online bookstores.
Now begins a new, Self-Publishing 3.0 era where self-employed publishers will learn to start a business of perspective and sustainability.
The association of independent creations is the only global non-profit organization that unites writers who allow themselves to write books.
The objective of the Union is to develop the skills of self-employed authors, promote ethical activities, help beginners to sell books and encourage producers to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The Presidents of the Party and the Central Bank warned the Italian Government of the planned deficit
Upon hearing the popular government plans to significantly increase deficits next year, the Italian President and the head of the Central Bank warned on the sixth day that the country's debt must be managed.
On Thursday evening, the ruling party (Opposian Movement of Five Stars and the North Left League) presented a proposal for a deficit of 2019, which would aim at a deficit of 2.4 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and three times above the previous administrative objective.
This report touched the market on Friday and encouraged the sale of bonds and made it difficult for bank shares.
Moreover, such plans are incompatible with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and monitors their compliance.
On the way to the Auditorium in the President's Chambers, which mentioned in the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Mattarella noted that under the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and debt managed".
"We will protect our citizens in this way," he said
A few years later, at a central conference in Italy, the President of the Italian Bank, Ignazio Visco, said that the country's debt could not be further increased, which is the largest of the major economies of the European Union and is gaining 131 per cent of GDP.
"It must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, based on the public knowledge agency Ansa.
‘The school must be reduced accordingly.’
The head of the north level and Vice-President Matteo Salvinis responded to Mattarella's words that the debt had increased for the year to apply the strict requirements of Brussels.
"Remember, Mr President," said Salvinis in the statement.
"The debt of the state has been reduced for one year to the budgets of the European Union. We can change plans at the end of the year, with a view to improving the future and growth."
Earlier, before calling Mattarella or Visco, the leader of the Fifth Star Movement Luigi Di Mayo said that the money would be taken back from the budget" but added that the government did not intend to oppose EU or financial markets.
The ruling party urged the non-group economic minister Giovanni Tria to support their planned deficits.
The Italian press claimed that Mattarella supported Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit, which would not be 2 per cent of GDP.
The Presidents of the Party and the Central Bank shall not directly affect the economic policy.
The 77-year-old President may reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then adopt and enforce an unchanged law again.
Official information: Indonesia’s tsunami has missed a big bang
The Indonesian Geophysics Agency called off the warning about tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then a terrible earthquake struck the southern coast of the island of Sulawesi, where hundreds of people were killed, and thousands were left homeless.
Car rental in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the earthquake and tsunami of 7,5 balsam, about 1,500 km (940 miles) from the town of Palu in Jakarta, at least 384 people were killed.
On Sunday, officials said that the number of victims was almost up.
On Friday, most people gathered at the festival in Palu in a flood where many of the people had lost six feet (18 feet) of high ground.
On the sixth day of the BMKG, the Geophysics Agency received criticism in the social media: many people wondered whether the warning about tsunami had not been sounded too early.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out a standard procedure and decided to withdraw the alert from the data from Palu by the latest water source of about 200 km (125 miles).
‘We do not have surveillance data from Palu.
So we had to make a decision on the basis of the data we had," said Rahman Triyon, head of the BMKG earthquake and tsunami centre.
The most recent water meter measuring the change in sea level was only determined by its claim to be an "unnecessary" foot of six inches (2,5 cm) and did not detect massive waves near Pala.
‘If we had a swimming pool near Pala or the data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to think about it in the future," Triyon said.
According to officials, the tsunami struck Palu and the surrounding areas at an altitude of 100 miles per hour, but it was not clear whether it occurred before or after the withdrawal of the warning.
Residents check the lavender on the street looking for their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"On the basis of the video on social media, we believe that the tsunamis took place before officially withdrawing the warning," Triyon said.
The most serious injury caused by the earthquake of 9.5 balsam occurred on the second day of July 2004 and caused a massive tsunami that killed some 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The beautiful city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is located near the coastal coastal island of Slavonia in the northeastern part of the country.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the tsunami struck the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to the University of Oxford geophysics researcher Baptiste Gomberto, the earthquake was not supposed to cause tsunami.
The 5th day earthquake caused a horizontal wave – the next tetanus was moving horizontally rather than vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a flood in the sea, a flood of water and a tsunami,” he said and added that the power of the coastal movement could be concentrated in the dry forest.
The representative of the disaster relief agency Sutopo's Purwo'as Nugroho told the correspondents that his team was "ready to send easily understood public warnings", when the warning about the tsunami was called off.
According to the Ministry of Communication, residents were repeatedly informed of the text being sent with warnings, but Nugroho said that the electricity and communications lines in the ground had been shut down and the leaves had been empty.
In the social media, the Indonesians questioned whether BMKG had to give up warning of tsunami and complained that the information had not been provided in time.
"I'm late... The warning has been cancelled... And the tsunamis have still occurred..." – Twitter user @zanoguccy sent a well-known BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood is trying to break ticket sales records
On Saturday's winning fourth rounds, Francesco's Molinaris and Tommy's Fletwood became the first two of Europe's to win all four matches, and it will most likely be written in history, as Europe is already the first hit by 10.6 before the end of Ryder's turn.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau as a result of 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four matches.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
The surprising results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
Three times he won 14 important titles in Woods and twice won against Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory against the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas – the US team this week that won three other battles.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five out of five.
Fletwood has already won most of the points of Ryder's tare in the production of units as a new European.
The couple who received new circuits from Mollywood, at first, did not seem to be able to move the European team forward.
From Ryder’s father, a young man such as Fleetwood, was not convinced of such an appearance, and Molinaris did not succeed in one of the previous six legs and was exposed to four ribs.
However, there was also hope: Fletwood was the first in Europe last year, known as Le Golf National, as its five pillars, and here in 2017 he won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a strong temperature during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion and is considered by many to be the most influential of a team of European tournament players – it is a useful feature in the front row where a proud word can be a disappointment, as the American failure has shown.
These toys and a harmonious game in the field made them inactive.
"Now I feel a little so sensitive, but only on six days," said the release, singing Fletwood, playing with a wide smile all week long.
This afternoon we show great, play stable and good.
If we recognize it together in history, this will be a remarkable achievement.
I'm just glad we're on the team."
Molinars were also shocked.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to do our duty, not just go to the record book, so we will have to fight hard tomorrow for 4.5 points that we need to survive; it will not be easy."
Rite's hot!
Ireland’s neighboring mid-West Fight Field
The island of Claregalway, in the west of Ireland, was once powerful, a 15 - year - old family’s main fortress, and this sixth day was remembered for its origin.
Ritre's two soldiers during the mid-term battle festival at Claregalway in the Gulf of Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
A fully restored Anglo-Normian home with a bott was converted into a middle-aged field of combat, where many enthusiasmists from all over the world have opened up contact with battles and games that were popular centuries ago.
After my return, Karla Dornanas and his brother-in-law, Donna Dornan, patrolled the city of Claregalway during the mid-term battle festival in Golve, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
"It's a great weekend going out and something unusual," said Dennis Fitzgerald from Kerio's graffiti family on the floor, throwing the fighters into the fields on the floor.
"This is how we go back to simple things.
I'm trying to do everything as necessary," said the theatre worker, who participated for the first time in the armed struggle festival.
The forest was surrounded by authentic combatants, and though their swords were thick and thin, some of the country’s tribes had fallen, and one had damaged the lion.
The trainers demonstrated their skills by driving and pushing the wheels and the bows across the side.
The metal blades carried weapons, the enemy buyers prepared drugs, and the amate’s belt and wore wool.
The participants, who were deeply involved in the event and parts of the event, tried to get involved.
"I think that anyone can wear costumes, but the involvement is mine," said Helena Stackpole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had the unique opportunity to use his fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are hand-held.
For two years I've been wearing my shirt, and now I'm wearing a dress, and I've only got 800 pearls on her hands.
It matters to me," she said.
Following earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia increased to 832 on a Sunday and the affected area is greater than initially considered.
At the news conference, Sutopo's representative Purwo's Nugroho said that many people were trapped in mud slides after a 7.5-ball earthquake, a five-day incident and a six-metre (20 feet) high tsunami.
The FBI called on the second woman accused of candidate Kavanaugh
FTB agents, investigating the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretto Kavanaugh's case, called on the second woman, who accused him of sexual harassment, which was the day after the divorce of this woman's lawyer.
The report by Deborah Ramirez, a lawyer, John Clune, states that the FTB will carry out an investigation of Kavanaugh’s case not only after a separate trial, but which was presented this week at the dramatic Senate session of the Federal Court of Appeal.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh of showing her his pen during the evening that was held and who was held at the University of Jeille when both of them were studying there.
President Donaldas Trumpas of the United States submitted to the pressure of the independent Senate Republics and instructed the FTB to conduct an investigation after the 4th session of the Senate, in which Professor Ford of the University of California made detailed allegations that Kavanaugh tried to make it public during the evening, in 1982 when both of them attended school and were grown up.
On the sixth day, NBC News reported that the Baltic Chambers limited the scope of the FTB investigation.
The crowd rejected this and announced the Twitter news: "I really want them to ask all the people who need their attention."
The White House representative Raj Shahas said that the Senate determined the scope and duration of the FTB study (the study must be completed within a week).
"Baltic rooms allow agents to do what they have to learn," Shahas said.
United Kingdom will not comply with environmental or animal protection standards after "Brexito"
Environment Minister Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not break environmental or animal protection standards so that trade negotiations can be made after Brexito.
Michael Gove, Secretary of State of the British Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, came to Daunggo Street, London, on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservative Party Conference, Gove said that it is useful for the United Kingdom to be informed about its quality food products and government to publish a food strategy this year.
Europe restores Ryder's roof to units in circulation
Francesco's Molinaris won the prize on Sunday by returning the Ryder tab to Europe: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th floor and worked on a score of 14.5.
Mickelson gave up the first bottle in the water, and when he was able to stay in the heating room, Molinaris became the first European to win all five matches a week, although he did not win one of the previous six.
Europe's victory has already been ensured that the Italy's move from the beginning to the bottom left was missing one point, and Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia first took the floor and was secured at least half the point.
At the beginning of the day, they had first score 10:6 and had to win four and a half points from the 12 possible points so that they could restore trophies and confirm their accommodation in homes that had ended since 1993.
Just two times before this, the teams managed to eliminate the difference between the four points and win the unit movements: this was done by the U.S. team in Brooklyn and Europe in the 2012 Media Survey, but no one was able to find another shocking return.
Justinas Thomas, Webbas Simpson and Tony Finau's team gave Jim Furyko teams hope to win the first match, but then the European team points were all over the area.
Thorbjor Olisenas disturbed Jordan Spieth, and his team friend, John Rahmas – Tiger Woods: 14 important titles won the athlete four times from four.
The best player of Ryder, recognised by the player, Ianas Poulters won, most of the ovaries this week, when the best player of the world, Dustin Johnson released him in the 18th grade and approached Europe to win.
Then he had to find out who the game was going to end first, and it was the Molinary game, which caused the joy of the mina, which was the greatest in the history of the event.
RT World News: German police protecting Erdogan used the name neonacio as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in East Germany, Turkey's President Erdogan was protected this week during his visit to Berlin, using the name of a crazy neonism.
The Ministry of the Interior of the Region said that the Saksonian Land Crime Police in East Germany was investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist entity SEK.
Men were intended to protect Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long journey to Germany.
Owners had to work secrets, so they had to use the code name under the protocol.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt – a crazy non-unionist who belonged to a group of extremists of the National Socialists (NSU) who, at the beginning of this year, killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media reports that the changed code was informed when two police officers requested permission to obtain the internal documents required to be carried out.
The chief of police called and called out the police immediately.
The police chief of Saxony, Petricas Kleine, first responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use the name Boehnhardt was "must have been the most appropriate" and thus "explainly ignored victims and their friends".
Minister of the Interior of Saxony Roland Volleris endorsed this statement and called the decision "study, fear and totally unacceptable".
The 5th visit of Erdogan in Berlin caused much opposition in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticized for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was of great importance, “unless there are differences, they need to be resolved personally. ”
For the first time, the public heard of the NSU in 2011 when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his partner, Uwe Mundlos, were found in the east in Germany.
One of them was thought to have killed another and then killed after an unsuccessful attempt to surround the bank in Eisenacho.
Shortly thereafter, the third member of the group was arrested, and the last life left Beate'a Zschaepe.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to 10 life imprisonments.
She did not get involved in murder, but her lawyer said that the accused felt a moral burden because she did not try to stop the killings.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agency received a lot of criticism.
Judges, activists, and victims’ friends believe that the group had a lot more associates.
It was also clear that the German internal intelligence agency BfV had infiltrated many informants to the NSU and has been constantly hampered by the investigation of the groups involved in killings, killings and killings.
The Musca is running from Tesla's manager's duties and will have to pay 20 million dollars for the Securities and Stocks Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities and Stocks Commission, which presented him to the Court on Twitter, in which he claimed to be a private company in Tesla.
Muscas will have to withdraw from the Head's duties, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the Agreement indicate that Muskas, the President of the Tesla Board of Directors, must be removed within 45 days and shall be prohibited from returning to these duties for three years.
In addition, he'll have to pay 20 million dollars.
It all started with Twitter, which was unguarded or written by the wrong-doers, so Muskas will have to get an early confirmation against anything saying or advertising of Tesla "in any form, including, but not limited to, social media (e.g. Twitter), company website (e.g. company’s website), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it has not checked the original Musko Twitter news.
On 7 August, Muskas was accused of investing in securities and the jury’s complaint on Twitter, where he claimed that he had found funds to make Tesla a private company worth $420 – so the company’s securities were worth more than 10 per cent.
The mouse soon withdrew his words saying that Tesla would remain public, and the investors were shocked.
The Commission on Securities and Stocks concluded that the original statement of Musko was “unjust and misleading because it did not support the facts”.
According to Muska’s online account, this error can be corrected: after meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabia’s independent asset fund, he was surprised to be able to agree on funds.
It is reported that the Moscow Commission for Securities and Stocks and Stocks had been brought to a more brighter sentence – it was necessary for Moscow to reject the president's position for only two years and should not be recognised as a loss, but Muskas rejected this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell, and as a result, it changed its opinion and agreed with stricter conditions.
However, according to the new agreement, as in the past, Moscow does not need to acknowledge the accusation of investor error.
Alexandrian patriots committed to supporting the canonic church of Ukraine and urged Orthodox unity
Alexandrian patriarch Theodorus II applied on the basis of the canon of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which belongs to the Moscow Patriarchate.
He said in response to the resignation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the patriarchate of Constantinople.
On Thursday, Theodorus arrived in the city of Odès in the south of Ukraine and met with the highest clergy and the religious orthodox.
Alexandrian patriot is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchies, which only leads to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.
"I am here to tell you: do not reject the Orthodox faith and canon churches," said Patrick Theodore II.
Before his visit to Odes, he met with the Polish Orthodox metropolis Savva, who also supported the canonic church of Ukraine.
The Court also called for the prevention of conflicts caused by attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian Church.
"We will always support those seeking orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of Constantinople patriarchate to recognize the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinepolis decided to send exarchus to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one of the Orthodox churches to imprison others.
Egzarchai are special patriarchal representatives, formally operating a higher position than the Onupriy Metro, who is now the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which belongs to the Moscow Patriarchate.
Moscow's patriarchate has responded positively to the actions of Constantinople and has withdrawn all the joint church prayers and membership in organisations which are led by or together by the President of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that Constantinople had been warned not to take any other countermeasures and that both churches were not considered to have completely ceased the union.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one is recognized as the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Moscow patriarchate.
The majority of Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the Eastern Orthodox Church, which belonged to the Kiev Patriarchate, which was established in the 10th century.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Filaret, who seeks the recognition of the official Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the Moscow Patriarchate.
For the first time in three years, Damascus opened the main Syrian-Jordan trade crossing
According to SANA, the Syrian government has claimed to open with the crossing of the Jordan-in-the-Nasib border, which has been closed for three years due to war operations in this territory.
This can be done because combatants spread land on the Syrian side to the city of Dara.
Nasibas is the most important trade union not only between neighbouring countries but also between Lebanon and Persia.
Most important thoughts from Lavrvo JT
While visiting the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrova was shocked by the "political and brutal force" on the West, he said that diplomacy must not give dictatorships and unilateral sanctions.
On Friday at the United States General Assembly, the Minister said that some Western countries, trying to maintain their "own position of world leaders", do not pressure others to do so.
He did not mention specific countries, but said that they use "political scandal, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for a small group of selfish ambitions.
Lavrov, a ten-year representative of Russia to the United Nations, said that the culture of diplomacy and negotiation is changing, and the unilateral sanctions applied without the approval of the United Nations.
The Minister said that the sanctions applied in many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and a reminder of the many years of the U.S. blockade applied to Cuba.
"But the story didn't pay us anything," Lavrov said and added that "The mayors are willing to bring the price only if it's "very likely".
We recall how often the charges of such unjustified charges were justified by the rape and war, such as the explosions in Yugoslavia in 1999, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the invasion of Libya in 2011.
Of course, Lavrov mentioned not all Western invasions and commemorated the seven-year war of Syria as one of the most recent cases.
The failure of the extremists to convert the Damascus regime could have been devastating to the whole country and opened the possibility of defeating the ‘terrorist caliph’.
Lavrov has re-examined the peace process that Russia, Turkey and Iran have launched together and said that this process has helped to prevent the Islamic state (IS, previously referred to as ISIS) and other groups that want to occupy Syria as a whole.
It is now more important to restore the places of war and to help refugees return safely.
Lavrova went back to the struggle with great powers and said that the United Nations was actually created “the victims of World War II”.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs recalled that in 2018 he was joining the “fashioned” München Treaty signed in 1938, which France and Great Britain agreed to allow the nations to abandon the German-born part of Czechoslovakia in order to defeat Hitler.
Although that year, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times", the war began a year later.
Müncheno's publication shows how far it can eliminate "the country's selfishness and the lack of international law," Lavrov said.
"The colonial era dictatorship and occupation must be a contribution to the history archive or to the library."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the world's problems, Lavrov said.
“If you have questions or concerns, get together and talk, open the facts, listen to your colleagues’ arguments and try to reconcile interests.”
Christmas Christmas Eve?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are sinking into the sea, and Bibi is heading for Iran
The President of the United Nations General Assembly said Tehran has a secret nuclear weapon.
The other accused Israelites may have been blind to something.
Israel's beloved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released the news on Thursday – a picture of high-fashioned places where Iran is supposed to be using nuclear materials.
In a short time, Tehran replied that Tel Avivas would be more concerned with its “undeclared nuclear weapons programme”.
Although Israel has never recognized (but refused) the possession of nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdiev tried to explain whether Tel Aviv should actually seek refuge in his own grave.
The Scottish Government: before January no complaints were made about Alexo Salmando
The Scottish Government claimed that by January this year no complaints were filed against Alexo Salmando.
In January, the former prime minister was charged with two charges of sexual harassment, although he strongly rejected them.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Samsalda, removed from the Scottish National Party, has been charged with the Government of Scotland for the complaint against him.
In reply to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been filed by January.
The representative of the Scottish government said: “The Scottish government filed two complaints against Alexo Salmando in January.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Earlier that year, the Deputy Prime Minister did not raise any complaints about Alexo Salmando and, as we have already said, the first minister first heard a survey from Alexo Salmando in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes, and we will re-examine our position.
The Scottish Government will try to obtain as much information as possible.
However, as we have already said, at this moment for legal reasons we cannot comment on the case of Mr. Salsando anymore."
“ We have nothing to say, ” said the representative, “because our request to the permanent secretary is now under review at the court hearing and we hope that a decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk to the court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glazgas upset Dragons result 29:13: "Warriors" player Lee Jones asked
Glazga restored the winner's title in the "Guinness Pro14" league by winning additional points and defeating "Dragons" Scotton Stadium, and coach Dave's Rennies didn't hide satisfaction, but I think the game could be more accurate.
After the unexpected defeat of the Southern Kings, the team of Port Elizabeth last Saturday asked Rennie to find out the very changed team, and although it was able to collect the necessary points so that it could remain at the A conference, the winding and winding air was certainly not smooth.
"I think this morning we fought well, we played on the side of the field we needed, and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
"We have to play more precisely and we have been able to use more opportunities.
The conditions were unpleasant.
We have created many opportunities and we are happy to do so.
There is a need to play more precisely, but 40 or 50 won points today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We have won additional points, but the next week we have to make more effort to play at home with "Zebre" and another week with "Saracens" in Europe."
Although the weather was cold, the Glazgo team first started to win points, but the TMO prepared all the lost coins of Huwo Jones, including his buried inner transfer from Niko Matavaul to the left camp.
It was not long before the fall took place: the left column of Ollis Kebble's fourth minute was in the middle, and Adam Hastings was easy for the year.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwels Robson received the penalty, and the security took over another player immediately after 20 minutes of mark and the winner won the score.
The first half of the rounds after almost half an hour's mark was won: the Glazgo polos consistently broke the Dragons line, and then the judge from South Africa's Sturutas Barry's was sentenced to 22 minutes for asylum on the Hastings side.
The Warriors were allowed to enter the castles, but lost the castle after the massive transfer, because some of the hardy left side of Matavalu could not control the castle and it was transferred to the left.
The second test was performed two minutes after the interval: Hastings promulgated the Dragons line and wisely transferred the ball to run away from Lee Jones.
The camouflage was returned to Hastings in his position and the result for the waiters became 12:6.
On the second side, the first minute was very successful: Alexo Dunbar's pool was built for the second test by Lee Jones, and Hastings helped him.
However, the Warriors did not succeed – only four minutes later they took the ball in the middle of the street and the Dragons centre broke it down after the doors, thus winning points, and Joss Lewis later took it after playing the game with Robinson.
Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and 54 minutes after the fourth test gained additional points when Huwas Jones moved to the right and Hastings was unable to transfer the box (this was a third failure from four tests).
Glazgas maintained a positive higher position, and a fifth test took place in a few minutes – Dunbara transferred the box to George Horne, and Hastings won points.
Kebble's been announced by the best game of game, but Rennie's been hit by Hastings.
"They obviously prevented us from playing, but we got back in the middle," said the coach.
“He had a few meters missing, but he was cold and was still able to get rid of him.
He's a good shape and trusts himself."
Ayr United killed Morton's result 1:5: Ayr's family team of five stars
Lawrence's Shankland and Craig Moore's won two awards, and Declans McDaidas added another one and thus helped Ayr remain on the champion's board.
"Ayr" ran ahead after Shankland's escape from six yards after Michael Rose's campaign to McDaidud.
Morton's 35-minute first test was compared with the result when Charlie Telfera took a bullet from Robbie Crawford himself and sent it to the Ayr's master, Ross Doohan, to the far country.
Players from the fourth quarter of the second quarter had the chance to get out before Doohana chased Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidseras left a weak sentence, which the governor easily found.
The 74th minute of Ayr, the second time, the second time the replacement of Craig McGuffie's long distance was delayed and thrown to the ground was sent to the gates by another substitute player, Craig Moore.
Moore's delivered the same minute to Shankland, who made 17 rounds this season.
For the conversation, Moore went back to his own half a quarter from the area, and McDaidas sent a spare bag to the doors.
"Alloa" and "Falkirk" end result 0:2: the first youth victory in league
"I'm excited, I feel relief, I'm happy," said Ray McKinnon after the very necessary first Falkirk victory and the winning season points.
Ragers, a retired champion, Zakas Rudden (18 years old), won the victory in both pillars and threw the family team "Alloa Athletic" into the champion's button and released the club from the trauma.
"It was an important game for us," admitted McKinnon.
“After the last three rounds, we probably won more, so three points were very successful in the tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
That would not be a reason, but it was important for us to succeed."
Rudden sent the bull to Patrick Brough in 26 minutes and won the entrance from the middle of the door, when Demanta Petravičius slowed the bull over Governor Neil Parry.
"We wanted to be firm but failed," admitted Jim Goodwins, head of the Wasps.
Hearts circuit petition for the semi-final received more than 11,000 signatures
The petition by Hearts for "Betfred" was signed by more than 11,000 people on the semi-final agenda.
The jury is pleased with the decision to set up both semi-finals on the same day and at the same stage.
The Scottish Police Council, SPFL last week, decided to organize the Aberdeen-Rangers detection units at 12:00 p.m. and the Hearts-“Celtic – 19:45, so to be tested and the Jambos” and “Dons” circuit entrance.

Royal architects and musician Hamilton made the world light about the King's Circle III
The project that opened up a large archive of documents in the reign of Jury III was believed to help the public learn much better by writing, journals, and languages.
Now these documents will reach another audience. The Royal Archives have decided to cooperate with the music of Vesten.
Academics, who wanted to reveal the true form of the king, invited the musician Hamilton III to review the most important documents in the library of the rooms of the Vinzor.
The investigators are trying to make old letters available to a wider audience, so they will be able to obtain digital documents from the exhibitors.
The members of the royal family have already publicly accepted the creation of music, and the performance of the Saxes and Hercogenes will be seen twice, although Prince Hario’s protégé of the scene is always shown.
Michael Gibson, a playwright of the Vestedde kings, said that the documents had to be taken into consideration and helped to identify the kings whose image was the music of Hamilton, the film "Karaliaus Jurgio" and the series of children "Sioubing History").
"We've been dreaming of beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donaldas Trumpas did not handle enthusiasm after attempting to reduce pressure with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unu, and on the sixth day at his supporters' meeting, he said that after the recording, he “sympathized”.
Mr Trumpas and Mr Kimas said that they would succeed in the nuclear bombing of the Korean peninsula, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting that took place in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new stage of history after many years of public disagreement, the leaders of the countries changed with shocks and abuses because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear rocket capable of reaching the US.
“I was as strict as he was.
We were always suspicious," said Mr. Trumpas at a meeting in West Virginia.
"And then we laughed, understand?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."
Lekavicius and Panathinakis entered the Greek castle on the side-line
The Greek poet of the Athens "Panathinais" celebrated the victory in the Quartet of the Quartet, without greater efforts of Luke Lekavitės.

Skuvernel's wing to Shimonyte: Everything decided by the party's "greet"
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernels says that conservatives lack democracy in internal markets, and the party leadership has actually appointed Ingrid Shimonyt to presidents.
The very "democratic" ceremony was quite a change when the party's Greek leader decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps the second candidate did not have the chance to win even the theories," said S. Skvernelis to journalists in the government.
"Conservatives have appointed their candidate, with this and we welcome them," added the prime minister.
The Prime Minister of the "Green Greens" said that I. Shimonyt should be evaluated by the voters, who remembered her work in the Government of the Andrian Cublia.
Mr Skvernellis has not commented on whether he is taking part in the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian Union of States and Greens intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader of the ruling "states" Ramón Karbauskis called the elections of conservatives "unexperimental experiment" on the activity of small parties.
"First of all, we need to welcome an experiment that has not been completely successful.
Only 55 per cent of the party's members were involved, in total only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money was required to be spent on those elections, it is clearly one that this is not correct," said R. Karbauski to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I thought that some of the results would be unfair, because the result is none, the party decided that their candidate was all right, but who spends so much money," he added.
During the internal elections, 79% of conservatives and their supporters voted in favour of the I. Shimonytė candidate.
Lithuanian payrolls are funny: one area can change everything
With the data from the Baltic Salary Survey conducted last year, mostly in Estonia, wages are paid.
Lithuania and Latvia left a small part of their neighbors, writing in the company's press report.
"As a result of a survey of 850 companies and an average wage change in the Baltic countries, we see that the monthly salary before the tax this year increases by 81.8 per cent of the workers and an average increase of 7.7 per cent, and the annual wage with the annexes is 10.5 per cent.
Latvia has little scope for us - here is much more than a kilogram of annual salary, but as in Estonia, less workers compared with our country," says Paul Blusius, the representative of the company conducting the survey, adding that in the face of this trend of wage growth, the economic indicators of the country should also be taken into account.
Employment in Estonia is the fastest growing rate
While wages in Latvia and Estonia were about half as low as in Lithuania, there was an increase in income.
In Latvia, 71 per cent of the employees surveyed have increased their annual work pay and have achieved much more than 11 per cent in our country.
In Estonia, this year, 73 per cent of workers and averages increased by 13 per cent.
Retirement growth trends also have a major impact on the labour market, as changing jobs can receive much greater remuneration than in the previous workplace.
Those who have not changed jobs and jobs in Lithuania in recent years have increased their annual salary by 8.8 per cent. - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In Latvia, the annual wage growth of such workers was 3.6 per cent, respectively.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic countries not only as a medium-term employer but also as long-term employees.
For those who do not change jobs or jobs, the rate of salary is at least 6 per cent: the monthly average, including the appendices, is 9 per cent.
According to a remuneration specialist, such trends often depend on or are consistent with the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their projections, state monetary policy governing market trends.
For example, the forecast of a future economic collapse encourages business to behave more cautiously, less investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technologies, buildings, pharmaceuticals, can also produce common statistics and make smaller changes.
Maximum tax burden for Latvians
It is important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries compared with the growth of remuneration.
In Latvia, employees are paid most of the tax, even 31% or 34%, which may increase more workers to 42.4%.
There is a 24 per cent constant rate in Lithuania, so with greater remuneration for growth in Latvia, workers can benefit from the same or even less combined growth than in Lithuania.
The tax rate in Estonia is similar to that in Lithuania - 23.6 per cent, so in this country we find the most favourable taxation of labour in the Baltic countries.
IT - Competitive remuneration
According to the study, in all Baltic countries, almost regardless of the level of responsibility, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best payments.
The opposite situation in retail trade is the market index in this area, one of the smallest, so employees work less than the average market income.
In comparison with the past years, the rate of employment for plant engineers employed in higher positions, as well as risk management professionals, is high.
This increase in remuneration this year has not increased and some IT positions have increased by up to 14 per cent to a small part of the organizational information security professionals.
In the meantime, the wage for employment in retail trade has not changed.
However, some companies have successfully implemented remuneration reforms, resulting in an annual loan payment of about 2 per cent.
According to pay specialists, the trend is that the growth of pay increases and the needs of the most demanding specialists - further demand for systems analysts in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande is suffering again: the old promise doesn't end
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson, who was diagnosed with breast-feeding, continues to experience his own pain by causing wounds about relationships of the ovarians.
By participating in "Saturday Night Live" he chose to complain about how quickly he fell into serious relationships.
The speakers said that the truth was that just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete broke up with their vows, which took place only after a few months of knowledge.
Pete's tried to create a scenario that mentions his inconsistencies, but it's going to happen in the screen a little later.
It turns out that a humorist, out of his former relationship, finds his own friend Arian.
Such tears hurt her rather than her heart.
At least so far, TMZ has told the secret sources to the foreign news portal.
White or red: Which sugars are recommended for diet
Baltic or red?
Which sugars to pick?
During the hearings, it became clear that while Lithuanians still traditionally collect white sugar, the fact that many of the peoples of this country, the whiteout of the dead produced by the ingredient was rejected.
The sale of sugar has not increased, nor have trade networks representatives.
According to Maximos, red sugar is becoming ever more popular and the people are buying it even more, although it is usually white sugar - according to the choice it is still the first.
Plant and organic sugar sales in plant and specialised organic products shops.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to the Dietology, the main difference is price, and the harmful effects on health can be both.
"The raw non-refined sugar is three times more expensive, but in the health context, these sugars increase them by using their surplus is harmful to the body," said Dr. Vaitkevichitė.
Diplomatic diets are recommended to reduce the amount of sugar in the daily diet.
This will do - benefit from universal Europe - a calm and unpleasant kilograms, improvement and health.
If you use less sugar in a month, it will be easier to reject it as well.
"Every thought we form about a month's time, so when we do this experiment, say, a month's time when we treat a product without sugar - coffee or tea, we will see how positive it will work and I think that we can all reject as much as we can," said the idealist for rejecting sugar.
Doctors claim that the death of white blood cells without the need to be swallowed up by diabetes, cancer, and other diseases can be caused by the use of sedatives.
Therefore, it would be worthwhile to try to consume it at least as little as possible, since this product is added to many food products, even to the bread.
Another "Lietkabelio" step: Lipkeviškolina other LKL teams
The team of the Panel of the "Lietkabelio" welcomed Vytenu Lipkevičium - the pool is being built by the team of the "Skycop" of the Prienos.
In this season "Betsafe-LKL" V.Lipkevičius had a 6.4 point in 22 minutes, recovered 2.8 volts, delivered 2 results and collected 8.5 useful balloons.
In the 29-year-old FIBA Championships league, 198 cm old athlete's statistics achieved 3,8 points, 2,5 bounces, 1.5 performance transfer and 4.8 performance ball within 21 minutes of the game.
At the latest, Lietkabelis will announce a new buyer that will strengthen the composition.
S. Buškevicas joined the train station
The chief coach, Nenado Čanako, of the "Lietkabeli" team, became well-known to the Lithuanians as Sandis Buškevicas.
In the period 2005-2006, 41-year-old Latvians played Vilnius "Lietuvos morning", and in 2014-2017 he worked as a coach assistant in this club system.
Last season S. Buškevicas trained Jäkabpils' team "Jekabpils".
The director of the sport, Jonas Vainauskas, invited Stepon Babrausk to the station, but he is still trying to continue his career as a boxer.
The invitation was also granted by Vyten Jasikevich, but the agreement failed both sides.
S.Buškevicas "Lietkabel" coach station will work with Robert Kuncaichi and Algimanta Bruž.
On Tuesday, Latvia will join the "Lietkabel" and will be in the "Cido" arena during the FIBA Champions level match with Dijon JDA, but we will not grow on the ground, as the registration will be completed 24 hours before the start of the race.
The reduction in biofuel prices will not be acceptable for all
In order to reduce biofuel prices, in 2019 more leaf forests will be reported in Lithuania, says the Minister for the Environment.
According to Kıstuchi Navicko, this is what we want to do with biofuel prices.
"We've got a big deal of some kind.
It is necessary to balance (...).
The concentration on the top pages is because we can also have some effect on the price of biofuels," said Mr. Navick on the second day of September, explaining the situation about forest degradation.
According to K. Navick, this year the price of wood in Lithuania rose by about 20%.
According to the Minister, the next year, half will be cut as much, and this year, and the eggs will be about 80 hectares less.
According to him, in Lithuania wood is grown more because of the favorable natural conditions.
"That shouldn't be next year," said Mr. Navick.
Now 10,2 million ha forests are state and 800 thousand ha is private.
The fight against food prices - no doubt obligation: promoting only the purchase of your area
The proposed obligation to reduce the prices of the measures presented by the Ministry of Agriculture to public institutions and organisations to purchase 50% of the food from local producers is published in the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could also be provided to the purchaser in municipalities by local companies who have won tenders," Minister of Agriculture Virginius Sinkevicius said to the portal.
The President of the meat processing association, Egidius Mockevićius, has no doubt that this provision would make it difficult to check whether the law is not used by the dealers.
The measure on non-compliance is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation, Mr Sutkus.
Macronas calls for Europe to defend Russia and the United States
French President Emmanuel Macronas urged on Tuesday to create a "real European military" to ensure the possibility of safekeeping from Russia and even the United States
E. Macronas, calling for the creation of the European Union's common forces from its own accession to the government, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on the military power of the Americas.
He has recently received an important argument, told US President Donald Trumpu that Washington will withdraw from an important Cold War Treaty on nuclear power.
"We must protect from China, Russia and even the United States," E. Macronas told the radio "Europe".
This was the first interview to his radio since the beginning of May 2017 at the post of the Chair.
"When do I see how President Trumpas announces that he is fleeing from an important anti-dumping treaty created after the 9th anniversary of the crisis in Europe, which will be the main sacrifice? - Europe and its security," said the French leaders.
The above-mentioned rocket crisis has led to the development of non-strategic nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War, through which the United States has deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major factor in encouraging the US and the Soviet Union to conclude the Central Remote Nuclear Powers Treaty (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European military," said Mr. Macronas in an interview with the President on Friday evening in Verden, northeastern France, visiting our place this week before the end of the 100th year of the First World War.
According to E. Macrono, in the situation, "when Russia, who is at our borders, showed that it could be a threat... we need a Europe that is more vulnerable to itself and not just dependent on the United States."
The French leadership has become a major initiative to create a project for nine European countries that can quickly organize a common military operation, evacuation from the war zone or aid in the event of civil disaster.
The Minister of Defence of these nine states will meet on the third day for the first time in Paris to discuss details on how this power will act.
The European Union has also stressed the significant increase in its defence budget since 2021 and for research and new technology development of around EUR 13 billion over the seven years.
The current EU defence budget does not reach EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaras of the French War Schools, who is preparing high-ranking soldiers, said that the vision of the closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of building a common strategy culture is not bad - he told the news agency AFP.
- However, there is a huge gap between the European defence, which Emmanuel Macron's owns, and the truth is that there are very large differences between European partners."
Lukašekka NATO founded by rockets: we don't idiots
On Tuesday, President Aleksandra Lukašek announced that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to be able to reach the Western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be punished, displaced in Poland or otherwise, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially rockets," said A. Lukašenko, a group of American analysts meeting in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its rocket manufacturing industry.
"In the last few years - you have noticed and we have not hidden - we have created our rockets industry and produced our very precise (disable) rocket weapons," the president stressed.
Last week, A. Lukašenka stated that Minsk and Moscow were looking for a suitable and unbeatable response to plans to build a base in Poland and to call it "Trumpo Fortu" by U.S. President Donald Trumpo (Donaldo Trampo).
"Of course, that makes us worried.
If we wait, they say in Poland that they are ready to issue millions of dollars to dislocate some Trumpo for, of course, we are not idiots and of course we are responding to this," said A. Luschenka, attending the Main Group of the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
"To the surprise, we will discuss with our main Union (Russia) how to answer all of this and how to find the answer to the corresponding minimum costs," he added.
Western relations with Moscow have been marked by the Russian anaesthesia in 2014.
Their links also highlight the role of Moscow in the Syrian conflict and this year's war in Great Britain, as it is believed, the attempt by the Russian Special Service to eliminate the former dual agent Sergei's writing of nerves.
The tension between Moscow and Washington further intensified when Dr. Trumps announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia has warned that this step can undermine the global security system.

Alamus Horts could not be used for suspension
After this six-day period, Alalamo’s original player, Jalena Hurts, will not be able to be suspended for this season.
Hurts is included in the sixth-day match of Crimson Tide with the highest rating before the weaker Luizian team, and this is the fifth player's expected season.
This year the NCAA has adopted a new rule – it is possible to suspend the player involved in the four rounds.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts planned to do this because of the opposition of the player and the team coach station responded to them.
Tua's Tagovailoa's season changed Hurts, but trainer Nickas Sabanas said that it was still planning to use Hurtso's skills.
After the last season, Hurts helped Alabama to enter the national champion title before Georgia's team, but the second half changed it to Tagovalayas, contributing to the victory outcome of the Crimson Tide 26:23.

He also ran 15 times with a ball and broke 54 yards.
Owens: Dezas must sign the contract immediately
The former Dalaso "Cowboys" champion Dezas Bryant said soon to return to the NFL.
A member of the Slovenian museum, Terrell Owens, said that it would be better for Bryant to get away with it.
In response to a question on Twitter when he wanted to sign a contract with the team, Brightan announced on Friday a word known as "Twitter".
The three-time selection to the Pro Bowl team does not depend on any team since it was rejected in mid-April by Dalas Cowboys in the middle of April.
Bryant, who was able to withdraw the contract with the Baltimore Ravens, and who was always associated with Cleveland Browns, said before the season, that he wanted to change before signing the contract with the team.
In June, after Owens, still talking about returning to the NFL, the website TMZ said that Brittat should try to get back to sport as soon as possible.
"They must join the team and prove everything they can," said Owens' website.
"All observers think he doesn't care, and he's not as good as he thinks.
Now he has to go to the team for any remuneration, accept a contract for a year or two – that is absolutely irrelevant – and show everyone what he can do.”
In 2017 the British Dalas team received 69 hits, lost 838 yards, and six win points.
At the age of 29, the player spent 23 years in his career, not more than 100 years.
After signing a $70 million contract for five years in 2015, Britain did not lose a single season of 1,000 yards and did not receive more than eight points of profit.
“If the Director-General or Owner thinks your skills are being wasted, you cannot charge or collect the amount you want,” Owens advised.
He also warned that Brighta would have to go to the team as soon as possible, because later this could not be achieved in general and said that it would be possible to return to the difficult times of the Cowboys.
"Of course, I don't know if they're not connected," Owens said, who won 38 times the score in the Dallas team.
"I think Dezo's case, if Cowboys takes him back and he gets a chance, it will be useful for Dezu and French."
Advisory on the establishment of the CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
The representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN) in Kaunas last week appreciate the opportunity to set up a CERN business development centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe where companies receive assistance in commercializing CERN technologies, in producing innovative products and in adapting them to the needs of the public.
Although Lithuania has only recently become a member of the CERN, the establishment of the business incubator in the country has already been banned.
The representatives of CERN Kauna visited the University of Lithuanian Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kauna University of Technology (KTU) in the "Santakos" field of Material Science and Biomedical Engineering Institutes.
At the meeting at the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC), guests with KTU, LSMU, the University of Vytauto, the Lithuanian Institute of Energy, the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Agriculture and Business discussed the Kauna Innovation Ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on regional scientists and business innovations.
"This incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN knowledge and technologies to key problems, such as new technologies and working intelligence, to be used for disease diagnosis and treatment, for the processing of large data," said Dr. Leonas Balashevići, KTU Science and Innovation Projector.
The CERN incubators, like other young business development centres, provide business development assistance - provide information and expert advice on technology in product creation and assist in searching for funding sources.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
This centre includes experts in various fields: information technologies, materials engineering, as well as medical specialists.
The CERN organisation is best known for the LHC, The Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most recent component in the world.
However, CERN is carried out not only by quantitative mechanisms, but also by other areas, from chrogenic (very cold-temperature substances) to partial monitoring and radiation studies.
The work of these technologies and scientists has an impact on many areas of public importance: medicine, safety and industrial development.
"Vilnia's dent" has a new leader.
The new Director-General of the "Vilniaus Degree" appointed Mr Mituz, who will replace Raimond's daughter in these duties.
Since last year, the summer company has been headed by Mr. Bilkka to continue with the responsibility of the Director of the Vilnius Degree of Finance, which is said to be in the report of the Vilnius Round.
Mr. Mituzaus is a co-founder of Buga LT, which is listed in his LinkedIn heading.
In 2012-2017, Mituzaus was responsible for the regional director of the region for the "SPI Group", previously worked in the "Reckitt Benckiser" and "Unilever".
The first quarter of this year's "Vilnius detachment" ended with a loss of EUR 315,500.
During the period in question, the company was employed in EUR 392,300.
The company's sales income without excise duty amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13.16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
More than 100 people are working in the "Vilnius dengue".
STT stopped R. Ača - Business knowledge
The former parliamentary and former director of the municipal administration of the Region of Rases is accused of smoking.
He's in custody.
The Special Investigations Service (STT) reports that the Czech Government officials are conducting a preliminary investigation on possible corruption committed in the municipality of the Rases region.
"The former Director of the municipal administration of the Region of the Rases. R. A. (Remigius Ačas - rest.) is accused of smoking.
In the context of the investigation of the circumstances in which the public procurement was unexplained, R.A., in carrying out the duties of the municipality's director, it is possible for one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with the municipality of Rases in the municipality.
It is assumed that R.A. has received a high value of more than 250 MGL," says the STT report.
The BNS adds that this company is a "Rase Bus Park".
On the first day, officials also held corruption against Vladislov Šimait, head of the Russian bus park management company.
This BNS confirmed the STT representative of the press Renata Unit.
The STT report also states that the claims are also made by two representatives of the companies who bought Mr. Acha directly or participated in the masking of cash in various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, at their workplaces and at home.
Suspension of LSDD
After Remigiy Ajas, who was the director of the municipal administration of the Region of Rassés, refused to submit his report to the Balanese Council, he did not perform these duties.
He was also elected a member of the Seima for the region in May 2011-2012, as a candidate for the party "Tvarka and Justice" since 2004.
However, in 2013 he and this party were separated, and in 2016 the Seima elections did not achieve its own mandate.
Now, Mr. Time is dependent on the social democracys and the leadership of the newly established Party of Social Democrats of Lithuania (LDDD).
Shortly after this announcement, the LSDD president, Kirkalas, informed the press in the report that Mr. Time had temporarily suspended membership in the party until the investigation was carried out.
"The actions of the Special Research Service and the allegations of Remigija's eyes are an infamous step forward, but in all cases, it is necessary to take all the necessary steps to explain the truth.
R. Time has temporarily suspended membership in the party until a preliminary investigation is carried out," said the LSDD leader Church.
In 2003, Time was the leader of this year's President, Roland Pax, who was later removed from office by the head of the Advisory Group on National Security.

"I can't tell you, we were very affected by the functions, I as a seaman, he (R. Ačas - BNS) - administrative work, and I couldn't say, for whatever reason or for what public procurement this has been done," said the first day of the BNS.
He also argued that for the same reasons he did not want to assess the administration of the former administration of the municipality of Ačo.
I was afraid to say something that I could appreciate his work, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as I was offered for public procurement, for competition, said that such and such public procurements, such competitions, after something in the public area, were seen as contracts, which I had already seen as a sea.
Therefore, I cannot say how he managed the administration at the time as its director," said Mr. Gricius.
He said he was innocent of public procurement and had no influence on them.

VZ recalls that, in May of this year, Dr. Victor Bachmetjevas, Minister of Culture, left the team of the Minister of Culture for Culture, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums, and libraries.
At that time, Mr. Ruokytė-Johnsson said that her new Deputy Minister had chosen the same area as Mr. Augustine.
At present, along with Mr. Augustine's construction of the perimantic area of Mr. Blažijūn, the team of ministerial advisers consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidius Galiūn, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and the senior consultant, Eglä Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvila: EUR 90 million fines for non-impact GPAIS business
Simon Gentvilas, Vice-President of the Committee on the Environment, said that the low-performance information system (GPAIS) of products, packages and waste accounts (GPAIS) of Lithuanian producers and importers could have to pay almost EUR 90 million at the end of the year.
"After the end of the year and the GPAIS system has not begun to function normally, the crisis in the packaging management sector is becoming more and more real.
It is not officially claimed that only 1% of the proposed processing tasks were issued for signs confirming the disposal of packaging waste," said Mr Gentville in the press.
On 7 November, the Seimūn shall initiate an ongoing meeting of the Committee on the Environment, which intends to discuss the situation, to clarify why the functions of this programme are not affected, for which reasons there is no actual implementation of the programme module and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative change initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at risk and are again at risk of receiving extensive environmental pollution taxes at the end of this year," said Mr Gentville.
In his view, the lack of the GPAIS accounting system and the lack of effect signalled a serious waste management crisis in the packaging sector, which can be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Concerns about tasks
The fact that part of the undertakings may not act on the tasks of the processing of waste by the State established in 2018 and that some experts are also aware of it.
Following the development of the first half-year package processing indicators by organisations, experts agree on the basis of not being concerned that parts of the organisations may not be able to deal with the required quantity of packaging waste by 2018.
As a result, some companies may not be able to take advantage of the tax relief and would be able to pay the tax for a certain amount of the packages they have released in the market during the year.
VZ wrote that two of the three currently active producer organisations reject such abuses and one does not provide any comments.
Mr Pocius, the Director-General of the General of the Green Point, said that, at least formally, the success of the task depends on whether the problems of the product, packaging and waste accounting system (GPAIS) will be resolved.
The Green Point plans to succeed this year in the task of handling all types of packaging except glass.
Although the task of the Green Point will not be successful this year, the organisation is calling for compensation for the losses caused by this.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
By planning for the government to share coupons in food products and thus to promote the business of family or farmers, experts have doubts about the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that the new system will create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikovas, head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Confederation of Business Affairs, said that the coupons are alive and the problems are not resolved, and the Government should focus on increasing human income.
"The system seems to have changed radically and is taken from older leaders.
If we want to help the public to acquire something or have greater purchasing power, we must turn all our capacities towards increasing people's income, and people must decide whether to buy in one or another's store," said BNS.
According to him, the government, offering food coupons, would impose less income on the people receiving them.
"It seems to be applied to less income-generating people, who are on the roof with the help of a window on which it would be written, and we, this Government, have given you a vacuum, and be pleased with us.
This is due to certain anti-selective promises, where they want to write their signature very clearly," an analyst said.
It argues that the food coupon system will need additional investment, and it will increase its administrative burden, as it will have to monitor whatever it allows to protect them from processing.
The Swedish Bank's chief economist, Nerius Machiusulus, said that with one instrument both objectives - to support low-income residents and small businessmen - would not be achieved.
"If this is the support of small businessmen, cash aid compensates price differences, and residents can buy cheaper goods in smaller shops, it compensates the price difference from the budget by the State.
Then it's a business support, but it doesn't support the population," said Mr. Machius.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and the relatively unchanged competitive situation of small sellers, but, on the contrary, would create an additional bureaucratic burden and could hamper the emergence of new market participants.
"I think it would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with large administrative costs, and it would also be quite uncomfortable for the people, they should buy not at some larger store with larger adsorption more than house, but search for a few specialized shops with a smaller range," said the economist.
In addition, in other countries, coupons are used when the scope of goods or services is limited and must be given to all equal, or to some social group.
The people then receive coupons free of charge and can distribute them to food.
According to Mr. Machuil, they are also used in the labour market by providing temporary tax relief to companies with long-term unemployment or, for example, former prisons.
This practice, in the words of Machuli, has also been successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernel said on Monday that the government's consideration of a new food coupon system would help the poorest people to increase competition, encourage small businesses or farmers' business.
Prime Minister Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is mainly focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get 20% discount.
According to him, the quantity of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not abuse them.
According to him, 3-5 cups would allow a man to have 10-15 euros a month.
In his view, although no funds are provided for in the State budget programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from the European Union funds.
"Not everything that is currently planned or not in the budget will be final, yet he will change the Seima, so that happens, may be funds from one line to another, and from ministries, change may be part of funding.
It is always a matter of priority - or something - to resolve by creating another additional source of income and similar," said Mr Malinauskas on Tuesday, BNS said.
Before deciding what scope and when innovation can be applied.
