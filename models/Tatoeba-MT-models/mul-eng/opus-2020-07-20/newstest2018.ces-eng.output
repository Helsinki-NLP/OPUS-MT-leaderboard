The civil law appeal issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Elimination of Colorful People (NAACP) has published a warning for Colorful People travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of state and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's mission recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls for African-American travellers, visitors and people of Missouri to pay increased attention to the state as a result of the series of anti- racially motivated incidents currently taking place throughout the state," says the Association.
NAACP stated that it had acceded to this step on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which facilitate the promotion of racist acts motivated before the court, as well as the conduct of the authorities in criminal proceedings, which are not targeted at minorities.
"It is due to a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police only because of the color of their hair, are attacked or killed," announced Kansas City Star president NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We are now meeting with the largest number of diseases."
It's about the first warning of its kind that the organization issued to the United States.
Among the incidents that the organisation quoted were racially motivated charges directed against students of black hair at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black hair from Tennessee.
Sanders died in conflict at the beginning of the year after he got a gas station on his way to the state, and the police arrested him without accusing him of breaking the crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent declaration of the state's highest state representative of Missouri, which indicates that the driver of the blacklights has a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The aim of the travel recommendation is to warn people and protect their families, friends and colleagues from what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared - they should take money with them on the appropriate penalty of imprisonment or warn their neighbours that they are going to travel to the state."
According to the current figures of the FBI programme for the reporting of hate acts, in 2015 the percentage of hate cases occurred in Missouri, reaching the sixth place among all states.
The road exhibit is also a response to the new Missouri Act, which facilitates the harassment of discrimination against companies when providing housing or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the adoption of an immigration law, which allows state actors to retain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which, according to ACLU, is to improve racial profile.
The travel recommendation usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to foreign countries, but in recent years, the legal groups have resorted to this measure in response to specific laws and trends in the United States.
The model was killed by the chief.
Her family hasn't been quiet for 12 years!
The murdered Sally Anne Bowman model.
The girl from Croydon was killed by chief Mark Dix in 2005, right in the restaurant where she worked, and she was injured.
The victim and the murderer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana and then kill her.
Vrah then sat in a nearby coffee shop and followed a thorough criminal work on finding a place to do.
Dixie, former chief, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years' imprisonment for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The judge only admitted the attack by the youth, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a dead girl lying on the street.
Three years later, the police testified to him.
Dixie claimed Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sportson had an affair at night.
Vrah said: "He was very angry and, after his attack, a girl began to cry."
"Even though she drew attention to the taxis," he said lyingly.
The girl was supposed to defend herself, but she could, at least, be seared.
Lewis was supposed to hit her on the street.
Dixie's version was shown as a lie and accused him of lying.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his persistence and his feelings for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt comfortable and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was in his former girlfriend, drank alcohol and took cocaine, he said to the police himself Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally began to cry for help, so he attacked her back and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family is headed for another attack on the side of the vandals, destroying her grave.
In the last six months, he was killed four times.
There's so bad people out there who dig these graves.
"So our daughter isn't there anymore," the Miror's mother-in-law told the girls Linda the information about the destruction of the Urn with the ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to fight when she left the cemetery.
The designer vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"Caches are neither prudent nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs a Persian store of intimacy.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic help.
Including those from the Czech designer, Anna Mares.
It's started suddenly, a mess twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friend came out on a bicycle after Moravia.
One of them didn't bring in not only the bike, but also the crates were filled with unscathed vibrators.
"Various baptisms and dolphins and all of them were green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend also decided to cooperate with a German manufacturer of design erotic help Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, and offered to assist with marketing.
When the associate went out to hire another professor, he rewarded him.
Today it runs in the Prussian Beneddictic Street Buttik Intimity, where it sells erotic aid in a way that is usually offered by luxury cables or boots.
Why not?
It's also about design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about in lunch, you're saying?
But come on, don't be such a puritan!
Just Berlin's Fun Factory trade, which proposed the famous designer Karim Rashid, served for a bottle of intimacy as inspiration.
It was opened in 2010 and was completely different from the concept of the erotic trade that everyone here used to have.
No hidden exhibitions, all made in beautiful, decent style, products displayed more than in perfume.
Martin, with his business partner in the Red Sea, began to consider how to acquire the Persian trade, where it should be and how it should be named.
The name of intimacy was popular with both of them.
"It's related to intimacy at last and it's still, it can be said, bad," she says.
She was tracking the purchase of Internet sites and looking for an appropriate space that went parallel to various interior visualizations.
Finally, she won the option, which divided the trade into the yard and the bedroom that leads to bed.
She prepared her for the Dagmar Stépáns from the Formafatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem completely ideal, because he's not on the main street, but because of that, he was sitting in the name of intimacy.
It's intimate.
He's in the street next to the main street, so no customers are looking at him," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a trade that would be different, with a brand-new beautiful thing, in the middle where women who are mainly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of getting into such a business.
When I got into the Intimity button about half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I shouldn't even feel like I'm going to business with erotic help.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure interior elegance, which I know from stores with fashion.
Although there is only female service in the business, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it doesn't mean that the male leg doesn't work here.
Most of the gentlemen here are going to buy gifts for their friends.
"The men in most are unable to determine the right size and prefer more," Martin laughs about a frequent mistake.
These are the premises, the living clichés that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith needs to choose a very big vibrator.
Likewise, a man likes a particularly black thread, where a woman makes it into a pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called satisfier.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know what's going on because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a free-of-occupancy clitor.
Pere needs to hide in me a teenager's face over the serious tone with which I've been given the explanation.
It's like it wouldn't work out.
And that doesn't really make sense.
It's a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so welcome.
It's about the last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the form of a sea horse.
He was concerned that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second time he was a vibrator for the We-Vibe couple.
He completely collected a tab that some men can survive and that he sees competition in erotic aid.
"There are different options," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
A woman may have control in her hands and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the other hand, a certain diver is a category of trailer vibrators.
At least we have it.
Czech women seem to prioritise multi-purpose aid and buy classic vibrators, although they should only use it externally.
Right in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept works exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what men offer," says Martin.
"We also have aid for them, but to a limited extent." Most of them are sold primarily by a masturbator, in this case by the Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn't look like anatomical like vagina, but "spire as a spray gel or as an egg or a futuristic object.
Much is focused on the function and benefits of use.
It's totally different in Japan.
It's a miracle in me.
I was thinking that the Japanese would be very much involved in erotic help, I guess.
"This is the reality of the Internet," I explained.
This whole thing's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic assistance is more closely linked to the use of women.
In Japan, they are simply normal for men, but they are taboo for women."Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese sign of Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity button, is sold worldwide, creates a constant drop of half of what is sold only in Japan.
In Our Waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are no good at all.
On the contrary, we are a hostile nation.
It's decided on a difference between the country, such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical customer of trade moves between 35 and 50 years and "has a certain experience with sexual life, but with some help.
It comes for something nicer, better, which would fill a partner's life, or for himself."To return, Martin Raj with his business partner in the Red Shebelko is looking forward to making sure that each product is fully functional.
We also don't want to go to the specialty of the type of bathroom and latex, because we don't have space for it, but it doesn't happen here.
Such things could affect those we're trying to reach.
What are the people who always had to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would happen to them.
The composition of the products displayed on the police is really popular.
This is also given by the choice of represented renamed characters.
Some even obtained design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first prize was mentioned by the sea horse "and it made changes throughout the industry.
It started to get rid of cheap materials and, instead of working with healthy non-smokers, it started to produce other designs, different colors...
It's nice to see that some of the designs are made by Czechs and by popular designer Anna Maresov.
I've got to say that I've been quite surprised by how many people have the design stuff Whoop.de.do from Anna Mares's purchase, although they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who go directly to Venice's girl from Anna Maresov.
It has led to a truly huge turn of work by representing exactly what we are trying to present to us in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aid can do differently, beautifully, with the story.
Anna's story started as a school job.
Now it's about the finished product that's also made for us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how to make Whoop.de.do products.
Because it's not about big jobs, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going a little against the flow, but I think it's important to keep the development in us in the Czech Republic.
It might be easy to say that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," she later describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is still more open.
A negative or negative presence is not affected.
At least they're the first people to break up.
"But you also start laughing." Currently Anna Maresov has a vibrator on which you can let your personal message be prepared, and this year she also plans her own lubricant gel.
The next year, she should get a vibrating egg and other news.
Limits on healthy sex
I'm curious where he's lying at the limit of what's right.
Is there something that Martin Raj wouldn't sell anymore?
It's very hard to define.
What happens to the normal one, the other may seem to be just abnormal, so we are more likely to mix with the variety of brands.
None of them will be allowed into some extremes.
Just before we get divorced, I have the last question: What was the crazyest question they've ever had?
Right now, in the week, he came in an e-mail in which some woman asked for Masturbation aid for her friend with a birth of 20 inches [20 cm] long.
So we had to write that we had no such regrets.
It's still a question of whether any of us were having a good time," Martin's suspicious opinion is worth it.
And it's been a while...
Morning for Karl Gotta.
After two copper Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štédrý is fighting with a serious disability.
The best friend of Karl Gotta is fighting with a weakness that will rob people of all memories.
"Yes, it was a shame of the truth," confirmed the sad information of Blaske himself.
I know about my disability, and I'm still in control of her circumstances.
"Beru medicines that have the original liver's inability to reduce," he added, thanking the neighbor for his support.
The whole developmental family broke down in order to simplify Karl's life.
The wife of Eva is trying to be home, most of which goes, after her father's home in the White Mountains, and daughters from the first marriage of Zuzan and Teresa, the son of Karel, named Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and gave Slavík his experience to support him during his compulsory treatment.
He's got sixteen chemotherapy for him.
He was able to get back to work and to the tennis court and to the skis.
"I've been told I'm going to be here in the '90s," said Karel Blesk.
He's a warrior.
He's still trying to sing.
"I'm still paying attention to the words of the song so I don't forget them," admit Karel.
The same weakness is now being fought in the constitution and the heretics of the Fiol.
Do you have a family of patients with Alzheimer's?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament rejected the ban on interrupturing, the law of the United States.
In Chile, an absolute ban on artificial pregnancy should therefore not be imposed on health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have brought trouble to the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide on what we have been doing in parliament for more than two years," said socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and, at the end of August, should receive a new president, who is a close opposition under the AFP.
The law of violating the absolute prohibition of interruption, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved Senate on 19 July.
The opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it says it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
The votes cast on the proposal for a law have been postponed in the past month until it is examined by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
In the middle of the proposal, the apostles agreed and did so again after the Senate.
According to the new legislative amendment, there should be a stop in the criminal practice of eliminating pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the child has no hope of survival, or if pregnancy has resulted from rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, and even before the women obtained their right of choice in 1949.
The absolute ban on the interruption in 1989 was imposed by the legal dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before leaving the office of President.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where the absolute ban on interrupturing is paid.
The following are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women in the network, who have been sentenced to three hundred years of imprisonment.
In many cases, this was done according to the defenders of human rights on the spontaneous massacre that the court has designated for murder.
Is there anything more sacred?
The goal of the White House is now Socha Freedom
A poor sign of change in the regime is the criticism of soybean.
The Americans could report it just as well as all the others - see the carefully decorated soybeans of Saddáma Hussiana at the Firdos Bandadian village in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what it was worth when, during a lively debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosto on presidential proposals for a drastic restriction on legal migrants, he expressed a symbolic security at Soch Freedom.
It's worth adding that Miller didn't stand on the couch like that.
To do this, he would corrupt the gift of the owners of the flight ships and the sponsors of the Sochy Freedoms.
However, he challenged its importance, in particular the fact that in 1903 the plaque was placed on the foundation with the famous Fascist Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller quoted Acosta as saying: “I don’t want to be left here in history, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom, which brings light all over the world.
The tax which was placed on the basis additionally, and which you refer to, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not about history here.
One is especially about the disturbing words Emmy Lazarus, who resonate today - calling them not only immigrants, but the stupidest of them: "Let me go, let me go, who is poor, who is willing to breathe soon, who is poor in the midst of the crowded cities."
And just in modern times, we can do better than ever to follow these "big red" on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the meaning of drought is part of a complex political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, just like her friends who after her death, had thought about putting a plate with a ring on the base of the couch, knew quite well that she would be going into a high political game.
Socha should express the commitment of the French and American republican governments to represent a classic theme, and the woman's desire for freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her case there is not an abstract woman's attitude, but has her own voice.
He also has a very different name: Mother of refugees.
The encounter with a woman's representative is a brilliant feminist stage and a devastating attack on American nativity.
And the same way Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the soybeans, the right of recognition is long sought to restore this meaning.
A well-known commenter Rush Limbaugh - Jana baptized in Trup's approach to power - argued in 2010 that Socha Freedom does not actually call anyone to the country, but represents an early non-constructiveism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: “Socha Freedoms is running ahead.
He's bringing out freedom from the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The journey must not be made to the United States."
Limbaugh's buying up on an important thing.
The count of soybeans depends on the scope of the inspection.
Emma Lazarus describes the juice from the view of the exhausted and lost traveler, who, often after a long and terrible swim across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart of the new country.
One is the world's view of people who are looking for a cure and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, it expresses hope and satisfies their needs.
And of course it's a perspective that Miller or Trump are not sure about.
Their origin is not to shed light on the way, but to destroy hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black sings praises to the British team's Scottish team
Elidh Doyle remembers the time when he had only two Scottish members of the British team
The director of the United Kingdom's athletic Federation, Neil Black, stated that a strong 16 Scots box in the World's Mystery team will be “a probationary contribution for the team”.
For MS in London, starting on Friday, the record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland, "something special happens" and British athletes can learn from Scotland.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it," Black said.
"I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The representatives of Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's what they do with what they do.
They think it's on the streets, too.
Whatever it is, it's just amazing."
Several Scottish athletes are going to force medals, including Laurie Muiré and Andrew Butcharta - who will compete with Sir Mo Farahem in the race for 5000 metres, while Elidh Doyle was elected as the captain of the team.
‘It shall be modest.
Her opening words were wonderful," Black said.
“Some athletes, whether Scots or other nations, left the rooms with a sense of horror and motivation.
The feeling of yours and of the unguarded feelings that Elid had spoken with was irreparable."
Commonwealth's silver medalist, who will compete during the 400-metre break in his fifth world empire, said that he is “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 to 2015 is seven.
In the middle of the Muiro Road, only five British and two European records were established in the last year.
The MS will participate at a distance of 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track for 1500 meters. He won the British team race and the annual games in the annual season.
Doyle remembers his first mission on which he was the only other Scottish member of the team of Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team knew that he was “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of his colleagues had arrived in the team but in many cases they would also be attacked at the end of the finals and medals.
"The unusual position of the captain of the team is that I was chosen by the other members of the team, which was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the members is a pleasure," he added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where I moved.
They're athletes who'll think of the first place on the floor.
What about my opening words?
Yeah, I think she did.
I've just warned that we can be proud of the annual ceremony because it's going to be home.
It is important to use the support of home fans and to rejoice that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance for the race and I'm going to enjoy an ineffective atmosphere."
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: don't worry about public function if you don't get the criticism of voters
Our father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the news didn't last long to start criticising her for anything, starting with Turkish politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism left her cold.
But he didn't try to hide criticism.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of expression can be taken away - and foolish and we will be seen as sheep on the stake."
It brings me to Maryland is the governor of Larry Hogan who needs to work on starting to behave like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and reduced contributions to at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, she was appalled by the American Union for civil freedom.
The government's employees rejected the complaint as unfounded and in comments on the Internet there were many views of the type "who cares about it".
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still depends on it.
Especially at the moment when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, it is a highly popular republican governor.
He can take the second highest love of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not crazy.
As it is seen, his state rules with certainty itself and adheres closely to principles.
It has also been shown that it is also useful to use Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - the exception is not even to publish the first photo with Holo head after the completion of chemotherapy.
Blocking people who welcome the government website - which is a public forum, marked as official and controlled by the money paid by tax collectors - is extremely dangerous and ultimately dangerous.
In a speech for Washington Post Hogan's speech, Amelia Chase's governor defended that blocking comments went from the point of moderation of contributions.
However, using images of Internet trolls, spammers or different people is too easy.
Washington Post told several real people who had been reduced contributions.
And that's exactly what they are - real people talking to their chosen leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolleys.
As everyone pointed out, their comments were lively and considerate, not glamorous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, applying for Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramia, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I was surprised to learn that I was disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports," she wrote in the section with a commentary by Washington Post.
"I do not like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, some people are marked for spreading so-called collective efforts instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested people."
What the government employees called "a centralised spam level" would probably call it "a wake-up".
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily make contributions by blocking criticism or reducing negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all the pressures with criticism or arrests or silence the protesters.
And that's exactly what's going on, just digitally.
Hogan is not the last public agent to be criticized for the denial of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a complaint from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The president of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first addition to James C. Cacherise in Alexandria, where she denied access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also expected visits from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, she had a low price of postal virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily printing was quadrupled and the position of the leader confused many anonymous writers.
And even in those times Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the press and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people under the online project Papers of George Washington Project, the petition was gathered in his office critical of his position against the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't.
Freedom of expression, non-compliance and fear lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, and abroad they need more data than home.
In foreign Czechs, they need more from their fare than from home.
Most of them are moving to Rakouska, but data consumption is taking place in the annual season of Croatia.
However, they have more time to browse the website, most of them have no access to Wi-Fi under the sun.
The beach, the shopping and the smart phone in your hand.
So it seems typical Czech allowed in Croatia after customers can use the services of foreign operators at home.
This is due to the clean statistics of the company O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech tourists abroad have more data available in the area than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where there is a minimum capacity of nasals across the winter, data consumption has reached even decades ago.
In the second place, Italy was placed in the pocket of the data used.
Most of the minutes of Czechs leave Germany, where many of them are fired at work during the years.
Croatia, according to data from the Association of Czech Travel Offices, visit 800 thousand Czechs annually, is our most popular destination.
However, people here have exchanged the book for sharing experiences using the mobile phone.
The record was July 7th.
"To transfer data would take tens of millions of photos," explained the details of the mobile segment manager at O2 Silvia Cieslarov.
Although Croatia leads to a range of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
The first place is Rakousko, followed by Germany and Slovenia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy is the sixth.
To Rakouska, we're looking for a quick tourist and active permit, which we don't have so much time for browsing on the Internet.
"Přes Rakousko more than Czech is headed straight to Jadran," Ceeslarov explained.
While the operator has recorded a high annual increase after the roaming fees have been released, on the phone the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes allowed in the roming grew to the end of the year to double.
With a huge leap ahead of the other countries, Germany is ruling here.
"Wolves in the room use more business customers on the workplace," Ceeslarov added.
Ronan Rafferty trusted in domestic atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former golfer, Ronan Rafferty, will be held within three days of the agreement in the comfortable atmosphere of the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, hosted by 25th-year-old Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland last year on the small golf course of Archerfield Links on the way to the finish line under Paul Eales. This year will play the role of Ambassador of the tournament in the representation of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've been watching Renaissance Club gradually grow in front of my eyes and the annual tournament will show the world its beauty," said Rafferty.
"The players will be able to love the first quality of the kitchen.
Jerry took a great job.
He's a hot fan of this game and he's proud of his success.
The annual tournament is in the right hands."
The English Eales will be the first to defend the mystery title, although during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
"I did not have the opportunity to defend my victory on Extreme Open because the year after my victory was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is ridiculous.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I really meant a lot of prizes for me and my wife.
It was a beautiful time for me not to forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after 50 years of celebration of the year.
This event will be his first part from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play at home floor," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to happen to you and then you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I think I'm doing it.
I'm satisfied with the results."
Three players are also joined by former winners Masters Ian Woosnam and senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former competitor Ryder Cup Sam Torrence are among the six Scottish players on the board; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Loss and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei's dinner is over, he doesn't use a break instead.
In fact, it's just how it's used.
In her wooden chart, which is located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually walks in a sweet brown - in the words of the local "note" - straight into the fire.
After half an hour, we'll take off and feel comfortable with our hands.
Bardina sits on a blizzard land - the house is not equipped with a furniture - where she does her daily work, such as washing bread in a frozen water from a nearby motley.
The bed in the room is filled with toilets.
As the youngest of four of her husband's men, she was not assigned any fields to work.
It's common in Poland.
Work in late nights is dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In the village, soldiers are sitting at the bar.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock no one will be allowed to fly around the village," says Bardina.
This is a common view of daily life at Papui’s height, the former Dutch colony, which was declared to be part of Indonesia in 1969 after the controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were brought to vote in the form of public surrender before the occupying army.
The current wave of protests against the Dutch rules quickly turned their anger against the four-year government, which ruled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enerodals are so far away and abandoned, where you will arrive after 19 minutes from the main city of Jayapura to Nabire, and after a five - hour ride.
The mass transport in this place doesn't work.
With 19,000 inhabitants, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bambosian floors, shrubs made of muddled leaves in the farsighted shady and shady colors.
There were only a few Indonesians, then journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christians, local residents worshiped the divine name, Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these watches," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-clown turban, dark triangles and syllable socks.
"We used to carry only letters."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and higher child mortality and gratisity is one of the worst in Asia.
However, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most famous gold mine in the Grasberg world, which owns Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a scaled province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport spent $3.1 billion on gold and silver.
In addition, Papua supports the tree's weight in the estimated amount of $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of suffering and a guarantee of a strong Indonesian army.
A survey conducted by the New York Times in 2005 revealed that Freeport paid to local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuanians calling for self-esteem threaten this golden nose and are therefore strongly attracted.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuanians have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in Papuan territory during the 70th century were similar to genocide, as stated by the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
In the last year alone, the Indonesian police in the region arrested more than 3300 peaceful Protestants.
In Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report of the Brisbane Archdiocese, describes the cruelty to which the last year, such as mymosoid corrections, torture - according to other reports, is particularly popular rape and correction of electric traffic - and brutal harassment of peaceful demonstrators.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because the incidents are coming every week," said Andreas Harrison, an Indonesian research organization's Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has caused the fact that the Papian sources are reaching Indonesia colonists.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are professing Christianity, but demography changes with some Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Javi, Bornea, Sumatri and Sulawesi.
The public canteens sell reduced cooks and gado-gado or green mix with arsenic oyster.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling corn and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuanci," explains four-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Pania and moved to the main city of Jayapura.
"The original people of Papuy - mother-mama (women) - have lost their job."
The Indonesian President Joko Vido, to whom Joko is represented, under his presidential campaign in 2014, promised to address the injustice and abuse of rights.
The former Tesserate also secured his way to the Presidential Palace in the Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, this has changed very little and local people feel hurt.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with hope that he would hear our call for justice," You said.
The fact is, just two months after Jacob's inaugural inaugural, the Panais experienced a great shock.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children sang their night song in the camp fire in Enarotali, where two Indonesian soldiers were stationed on the motorcycles during the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they'd have to turn off the lights.
One of the soldiers had this escape and the tone to which he had been hit and later returned with four other soldiers, introduced local manufacturer Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the basement followed the group of children and slaughtered them with their weapons, reported the victims and witnessed events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was so badly killed that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned down a nearby volunteer committee building and the next day the matter was still under way.
About 1,000 young Papuanian men and women gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military leadership and asked for justice.
They came with the official hunting lights and performed the waita dance - where it runs in the circle and resembles the song of birds - the populace of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began to hang on a stone building.
In an effort to force soldiers, an order was issued through the radio: “If the dose is tried at least three times for resistance, you have a permit to shoot,” stated the TIME weekly in an official document that has never been published in local media.
Jeremias Kayam (56), chief of fourth Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the threat and summoned the people to get to their homes.
But no one's had a match on his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left arm," said the TIME weekly on the edge of his wooden house.
Kayama doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his word, a bullet belonged to one of the nearby soldiers.
"There were a lot of people around and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was arrested three times as a witness to the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure that it was him," said the TIME weekly with a disturbing voice of John, who uses just one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw him dead... I loved him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "insurance" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said a press spokesman from the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder report was filed by the quadrant's media the following day.
Three weeks later he gave Jok a warm word in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the family of the victims and promised that he would be killed by violence in Papua.
"I call for an immediate solution to this problem so that he can never come back," he said.
Minister of National Security Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce a multilateral mechanism to resolve violent acts that took place in the past.
Almost immediately, but they started calling for an excuse.
“Most violent acts have been committed for a long time.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we're going to take these violent acts seriously, but it won't be a simple task," he said.
However, in a discussion on 5 June for the TIME week that took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to take any action in Papua New Guinea.
Instead, say that “all cases will be brought before the Court”.
Wiranto, who has been accused of “crime against humanity” on the basis of more than a thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Spain, have been reported.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Pania praised his claim with disbelief.
"In the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but I have never expected anything at all," said John.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he's still in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Pania residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to his word, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the funeral my body began looking for an army," he said.
And the shooting doesn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at the neighborhood near Deiyai.
On the path where one person and 17 others died were injured, a local and manager of the construction company refused to provide assistance in the transfer of men unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Doww (24) who died on his way to the hospital while fishing in a nearby river.
The Rozzlobe neighborhoods protested against the building company.
According to a statement by the police, they were shot after the related stones and their response was alarmed.
However, local residents claim that the mobile Brigade (the Indonesian paramilitarian police) started shooting at a man and killed him.
"There's been panic, we were afraid of the pay," said the 29-year-old Doming Badi, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to the arrival of wounded.
"I didn't leave home for two days."
The Danish Parliament called for the arrest of the police involved and the removal of mobile Brigadiers from the area.
You were always blind to the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the decision of indigenous peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central heights.
Many of them joined the Huntia for the liberation of the Papuan army (OPM) which protects the rights of the Papuanians by attacking and attacking the Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Spain. They're not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a result of the military attacks in recent years, thousands of Paniai were arrested and voluntarily detained, all under the pretext of "ensure national integrity".
Some of them will never be seen again.
You are known among the people of Papua New Guinea as “a tragic and forgotten place”.
The oil leads to poverty.
This little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the local.
And the bread is also unsatisfied.
More people feed their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaves of vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each makes four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of them are skimmed for the needs of families, the rest being sold on the local market.
Ten cups of sweet potatoes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the time that Nabire airport opened more air routes and started to pass new immigrants into the country, economic inequalities between native Papuans and immigrants have grown.
So few jobs are usually available to more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuanians have at least the necessary capital and education to be allowed to enter the business.
"Young people leave the village because of lack of employment opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Panai People's Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden in front of the world.
They are also contributing to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of the year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the pope because of "the lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they received such a rare permission to film.
Phelim China, head of the Asian side organization Human Rights Watch, Joko, promised in his voluntary campaign to break the strict rules for journalists and for achieving transparency and development.
"The border journalists who work in the most eastern and eastern areas of Papua New Guinea are at great risk: lack of water and entry into the black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia on Papuan affairs is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Šalamoon Islands - UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “various and widespread violent acts” in Papua, including shots in Paniai.
These countries also supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir accused journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights abuses.”
Local people call for foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, in front of the human rights envoy Keesm Van Baarem, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people called on the source that also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the word “we want freedom”.
In 2019 further elections are planned in Indonesia, but the popes claim they will not vote for Jok.
"To Jok is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people associated with a gun in Spain," said Gobau, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jok to know that the people of Panai - except that they live in constant fear of living armies - are fighting poverty, poor education and a health system.
The Gobai claim that the people of Panai, like the rest of the Papuanians, consider their voice to be “a debt, ” which Jacob must pay.
"They don't want money, they want justice," he added.
Despite threats and threats from family victims of panic attacks, the last symbolic act continues: they bury the victims on the ground against police and military stations.
I know that justice will never be done enough, at least not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"It was killing a member of our family," said Yacobus with his head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy held a $1,46 tons of cocaine at the cost of 256 million in Tichomore.
The force was heading towards Australia.
The four-wheeled crew of the ship, which is apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was closed at the time of the occupation.
Jachta, named after Afalina, was deported from South America to the port of Nouméa, a Metropolis of the French coastal territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Reporting Service indicated that it would work with its international partners to identify exactly where and where drugs were directed and to remove the "Litish Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures, which have stopped a large number of drugs leading to Australia," said her executive director Col Blanc.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumea this week.
Australia is due to high street prices of drugs for their feeders.
The country also faces an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current bond is not the first one in recent times.
Last month three men were charged with transporting a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, trying to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't have a sense of humor. Drinking needs to remind them.
The problem may be in the homes of seniors, according to doctors from Geriatric Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádló may be infusion of physiological solution that is being pushed into the skin by a thin needle.
But they're still only applicable to medical devices.
The older the person, the more the amount of water in his body.
"And more the loss of feeling alive, so seniors generally accept less fluid and are very quickly dehydrated," said Mádlová.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting to an old man so fluid is a big problem," he added.
In nursing homes, it's not often observed by no doctor.
In patients, dehydration usually resolves infusions.
"I think even there should be a step forward so that they can get subcutaneous infusion," she said.
In a day, the elderly can add up to two half-carcases of physiological solution.
The lack of fluid can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration occurs as a minor loss of property.
"One day that old man will say he can't get up from bed, he's talking nonsense," he added.
In the event of failure, it may even lead to brain damage.
Blood is absorbed into the brain and it is also a threat of renal failure.
Laundry patients should not be covered with peridium, maximally coloured space.
The problem can also be one-time complaints.
"It's a treatable nurse, but it would be ideal for the patient to open up and let the skin grow," said the doctor.
In Dubai, it's hot already in the area of The Torch.
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest modern blacks appeared in the clouds. The Hasichis had to evacuate all inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 floors.
For the last two years, one has already been the second fire of this tall building, which is not suitable for the name The Torch.
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there was no harm. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard a cry.
It took us ten minutes before we got down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the darkhearted people.
The Dubai Civil Defence indicated that the fires were managed by fire under the control of the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), which continued in the construction process.
The government representatives added that they will ensure a replacement accommodation for the eligible citizens.
The incident could also trigger a discussion on the safety of materials used to store high buildings around the world.
As a result of the investigation that started conducting Torch’s post-fire darkdrop in 2015, it became apparent that the most damage to the coating and the external panels were used for decoration or insulation.
The British police indicated that the London Greenfell Tower isolation and siege system could contribute to the rapid spread of fire in a red fire, where nearly 80 people were killed.
The results of the investigation showed that more than one of the five passengers to the United States provided prohibited items on board the aircraft
The survey between the passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them were deliberately or unknowingly carried out prohibited items via the U.S. government agency Transport Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of the passengers entered the deck with a knife or another sharp object.
Less than a percentage of passengers claim that they have found that they have been on the road with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
As a result of the investigation carried out by Stratos Jet Charterers Inc. - and in response to more than 1,000 respondents - it was found that there is a greater likelihood of breaking the rules in younger travellers.
Of respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to travel with an article prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers with several thousand hours of travel were compared to less than 15 per cent of members of Generation X.
Among the most common items that have been ignored by the TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents were informed of a sharp subject, while 2.2 per cent of women interviewed and 3.7 per cent of men questioned admitted that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the airport.
The company indicated that it carried out a global survey to find out how many of them were successfully carrying out unauthorized items over airport control and how much it did voluntarily.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorized items - whether they already know or not - travel by plane very often.
As the company has emphasized, the TSA guidelines are sometimes complicated and confused.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can spend on planes.
It is not surprising, then, that the TSA has played in the largest number of banned fluids.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would carry books in the same way as the stored goods.
Transport of liquids is permitted within Turkish years, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the revision of the planned guidelines for reducing Obama’s administrative emissions
After the Agency for the Protection of the Environment was accused of fifteen states, its Chief Scott Pruitt called on its previous decision on the implementation of the existing Obama administration’s plan to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide.
Pruitt presented changes to his plan. It reacts more strongly than previous governments respond to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October, when the States should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation for the reduction of the amount of the terrestrial ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that the agreement would extend for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan in order to avoid "the effects of local decisions or threats to economic growth".
Pruitt, who, prior to the Head of the EPA, President Donald Trumpem, has held the position of Public Prosecutor General Oklahoma for a long time served as a reliable supporter of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since his stay in Washington, Pruitt has again moved or removed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The rapid medium-sized business is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agency.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA executive has been in an attempt to remove the inclusion of Obama's administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce the losses of metal.
In a statement issued in the middle of the evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the commitment of the EPA to cooperate with the States through complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards within the given time frame.
"For the governments of the previous EPA administration, they often did not meet the deadlines and waited until they were upset by the active groups and others, agreeing with the timing and other setting of plans," Pruitt, who submitted more than a thousand complaints to the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in the regulation by means of a court dispute and we take the time to take it seriously.
We never complain about our status and authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt can use, in a specific paragraph, “a possibility of a transfer and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that the regulations “will be based on sound policies and best information”.
The Republicans at the Congress insist on a more comprehensive regulation of ozone rules.
The White House's budget, approved last month, shall be strengthened by a minimum of eight years for the implementation of the 2015 rules.
The measures have not yet been signed.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who stood in the head of the coalition of states complaining this week of EPA, stated that the group did not agree to allow legal pressure.
"Working in the EPA's views - following our judgement - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly involved in air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The earth’s atmosphere results when normal harmful substances are released by cars, electricity, oil refineries, chemical electricity and other sources in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The result can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and every year and thousands of premature deaths.
Public health defenders and environmentalists welcome the change in Pruitt's reputation.
"It is worrying what pressure should be put on us to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to deal with the ideological burden of Trumpo's administration, which is trying to help cleaners and special interests."
Paul's husband's oxygen, but he's not safe in court.
You never know what might happen to you.
In one moment you're home with your family and you're laughing, in the other, you're changing your whole life from base.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar judgment was met by Andreas Christopherus of Great Britain, whose face was healed by an unknown attacker who was finally released from prison.
Information entered Reuters web.
In December 2014, someone in Christopher's lock on the door.
Andreas said he was going to open up.
He was supposed to be behind the door, probably the cook who was supposed to give the wedding present for the family that night.
Instead, there was a terrible surprise waiting for him.
The man he never saw in his life, immediately after he opened it without warning, with the words, "That's for you, my friend."
That disease was undescriptable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I felt just an inexhaustible skin disease," said Andreas.
His family quickly brought him to the hospital, but his relatives learned a terrible message - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were still afraid that their patients would be infected, which threatened to enter his wound.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent of the patients ’ skin was infected with a form that doctors tried to combine with other parts of the body.
A great deal of trouble for Christopher became a loss of eyeglasses.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide in front of an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he wrote his torture.
Today, Christopher's got twelve operations behind him, which are not the last ones.
Urases that suffer from oxygen attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment according to plastic surgeons.
Even after oral and long-term treatment, the victims have suffered from tetanus to the end of life.
"Sometimes people don't get tired and fight for the rest of their lives against deformation and degeneration," said Professor Peter Düewulski, a British-speaking association of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The fighter's locked up.
With regard to the attack, Christopher is sure that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
The pastor believed that a man who had been sexually abused by his close friend was pregnant.
The police checked the whole case correctly and the attacker came back.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, it was not later that Christopher’s family’s appreciation for the prize changed fundamentally.
"The three judges finally concluded that the penalty should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
In the last few years, the number of attacks on animal substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed its concern that it intends to provide new guidelines to national representatives on the classification of raw materials.
You should be in the middle of a dangerous weapon.
However, victims of similar attacks are not willing to surrender.
They demand that the government of Great Britain impose more and more severe sanctions on freedom of people who attack their environment with oxygen or other animal substances.
They also require strict controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often available in various trades, because it is a different means of cleaning.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night a famous mraccorrap The Torch, which belongs to the world's largest residential building.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the citizens of the eight-footed buildings were able to evacuate at a time and no one was injured.
According to the speaking Dubai Police, he shot a fire in the ninth floor and spread up.
According to some residents of the house, however, it was wrong.
"It started in 67th floor, so they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by the Reuters agency, fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with the raindrops falling.
We slept.
He woke us up, people screamed.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us from 50th floor about ten minutes," said the landlord George.
Other witnesses for CNN claimed that the flames had captured about 40 homes.
On earth, he destroyed at least two cars when the hot parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to the civil defense report, a fire was sent under control.
The cause of his appearance is still unknown.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was an explosion.
A huge fire damaged Dubai's mrachrap The Torch also destroyed over a hundred homes in February 2015.
There are about 680 apartments throughout the building.
Even then, there was nothing wrong with it, because the people were able to evacuate at the time.
Mirakorrap The Torch was established in 2011 and then became its 352 meters tallest building world.
The record was prepared immediately next year by another douchebag mraccorrap.
The culturist had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win at all.
According to the list of Corriere della Serra, in the sample of Ippolita's thirty-one-year-old, there was a plague of unauthorized means - from steroids through diuretics after treatment with Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
He didn't even help this wild mix to his title, finished fourth.
Now, culturalists are threatened by four-year distance and criminal restraint.
The record was 11.
Loni was an Italian rapist, Davide Vasta, who was positively tested on 11 doping materials, which was at that time a record number of arrival athletes.
A third player started to take steroids a year ago when the culturalists disappeared.
Lucka Vondračkova, Czech Republic.
She was very interested in a former lover!
Sotva Lucka Vondračkė has moved to the territory of Česka, she's in one car.
And he's also paying attention wherever he comes.
The last time her ex-wife, Michael Longey, lived with her for three years.
Herec was 12 years old and had been living with his family.
Lucía was only 19 years old at the time, and she was determined not to pursue her career on the ice.
So they left, but friends stayed today.
Which also resulted in a press conference on TV Prima, where they met for a long time.
They've both been in a bad mood for the blue.
They didn't pick up themselves first, but they got close, and Lucie was ashamed of Michael's daughters when she fell in the back.
Then they'd fight and they'd like to see the photographers.
However, their meetings were not an accident, they were playing together a couple of miles in the new series of Primy Captain Exner.
Islamists have gained a life in Great Britain for the preparation of the attack.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamic bunker who said three men were planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four of the men, two of whom participated in the training camp in Pakistan and were previously sentenced to similar effects, were arrested in August.
At that time, the authorities thought they were going to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found partly a stand-alone tube bomb, knife with letters that mean "unbeliever" in Arabic and a gun-mock.
It happened at the time when the MI5 Secret Service agent was in the service of the rehearsal device.
"Recent attacks have shown how terrible it would have been if they hadn't been stopped," said Sue Hemming's prosecutorate.
Three judgements of 28, 25 and 33 years may apply for exemption after twenty years.
A fourth judge, who is 38 years old, can do it after 15 years behind the grid.
During the process, men in London reported that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an agent MI5.
The court also listened to her, but then rejected the claims of the accused.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In Hodoninsk, 38.3 °C was observed.
The southern temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on the shelf for only two days.
With 38,3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in The Watch Tower in Hodoninsk, passed on Thursday, which has become the last day of the year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech hydrometeological institution.
On the other hand, on Thursday, there were not a lot of heat records.
A record of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations over 30 years of age was reviewed or evaluated on Tuesday.
On Thursday the record temperature was only nine long-term measurement stations.
The fourth temperature in the Watchtower may have been the same as the previous record in 2013.
In January in Brussels, the first maximum of four decades was exceeded on Thursdays 37.4, and in Pohorelica on the current 37.1 level, the record was exceeded by three decades.
Both records have been published in the same way as in The Watchtower since 2013.
It was ten degrees below the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Watchtower, there was the largest audience in Dyjákvicí on Znojemsk and the ship over Dyjja on Břeclavka, where the Friday was held at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not end.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Czech countries, according to the CHHMU website, the fourth highest temperature was only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures began to grow there until late afternoon," said meteorologists.
The current trend in Czech society will be gradually rescinded according to the CHAMU and will be able to reach even greater levels on Sundays.
Most parts of Moravia, but high temperatures will remain on Friday and on the south side of Moravia and on Saturday.
China's missing tourists.
Peking's coming for visa policy for billions.
China, after ten years, is trying to apply its influence without using force resources.
He spends ten billion dollars annually on the support of language schools and the construction of a foreign university, pushes his entertainment industry on foreign markets, and tries to attract Western tourists.
But it won't happen to Peking.
The dark state media are talking about the plan to make tourism the driving force of economic change and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 per cent and a total of 80 per cent of Chinese tourists came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Tchaj-wan.
It is also due to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China is not pleased with the open arm, the assessment of the situation in the most western country of the world's professor of economy from the Beijing University of Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg agency.
For example, which speaks for all is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have an invisible relationship with China, the citizens of the rest of them must have a vision with the front.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore tax-compared with Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The view is $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait a long time in front of him, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions will be significant economic barriers.
Studies in the Journal of Economics and Finance have shown that the need for visas reduces the number of visitors in the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent in China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all citizens, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when the tourist movement uses its political goals, for example in disputes with Thaj-wan and South Korea.
When China mixed transport to South Korea in the context of the explosions around the South Korean anti-traumatic system, the South Koreans paid for it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits increased by 42 per cent each month, while Japan reported an increase of 85 per cent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the US Central Bank Fed, China was able to leave China as a result of China's foreign routes to up to 190 billion dollars, while China is expected to earn about $35 billion annually as part of the sale of exchanges to tourists.
According to the official figures on the development of the payment balance, China then had a 217 billion dollar deficit in the last year, equivalent to 44 per cent of the entire Chinese surplus in trade.
A small number of tourists in the country, therefore, who carefully defend the impact of the capital, are causing a very painful wound.
However, more mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general sustainability with regard to foreigners.
In many parts of China, however, no one actually heard of immigrants.
In 2013, more than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
And Japan, which is not exactly a cruiser, has a twin.
A number of scientific efforts, however, show that immigrants are usually reinvigorating economic growth, business and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find it practical.
The solution to these problems will be political, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visual device.
Other Asian States, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently developed a great deal of effort to simplify and simplify visa-making procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard change, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the rainy season, they multiplied mortally flat beaches.
The Kingdom of Plenary can be enjoyed by the young immediately by three ordinary, dyingly hungry plasmas.
In the exhibition, the visitors will now see only all nine freshly born Turkish mussels.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, which is 2,000 metres above sea level.
"Darest and metro lengths," wrote speech zoo Martin Vobruba.
Young people of the other two species, dying and red bees, will still be able to gather strength in the host land of the garden.
We can't say when people see her yet.
"We'd like to come over," said the healer Miroslav Dohnal with the possibility that it could last for a year or two.
The Australian dying snakes came into the world eight, the offspring of a moral couple from the population around Sydney.
"The only visitor they can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals around Perth," Vobruba said with the fact that in human care there is a need for a 6-8 week winter at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A percentage of success has been achieved by African swimming pools of red.
The bridge in the swimming pool was made up of four eggs of all four young men.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Voburba.
This species in the wild on its victim's skin is one, and it's up to four meters away.
He's measuring his eyes, he can cause his blindness to persist.
Young people of all three species live in the zoo with their muscles.
Up to 40 days in the garden are still waiting for young men from black mothers' bedrooms, eggs are placed in the incubator.
According to an unverified record of telephone conversation, Trump creates a pressure pressure on Mexico due to the payment for the border wall
U.S. D. Washington Post published a copy of the telephone calls of President Trupa with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview on 27 January, she asked Mexican President Enrique Peñou Niet to stop her publicly from reporting that she was not paying for the building proposed by the wall.
The president of the United States read to him that he was publicly removing the building of the wall, evidently saying: “You can’t talk like this in press."
Trup in his campaign announced that he would set up a wall along the southern border and announce that he would pay for it in Mexico.
He also publicly rejected his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, expressing his strong exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. inspection agreement over Australian refugees is "a joke" and "a fool" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which he took to the government of President Obama - would look like a "drug" after he proposed a ban on accessing refugees to the United States.
The trumpet call ended after Turnbull explained that "this is my most pleasant call day".
Tusk once again spoke to the prosecutors about Smolenska.
"I'm afraid of what," said the President's brother of the dead President, President of the Government of Law and Justice Pis Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
"I have no fear, Kaczynski doesn't scare me," Tusk replied and told the country's current leadership that justice is trying to exploit political opponents.
When he left the office of the prosecutor, he was waiting for Tuska on TV TV 24 taxes, which he scand for Donald Tusk! and joined the politicians for a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured him that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and the Kaczynski don't scare me."
The prosecutors have nothing to say, but they have no doubt that justice now has the Polish authorities to serve as a tool against opposers, opposition or people who do not like it, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's already been undercover at the hearing.
Expremier was heard at the prosecutor's office already in the area, this time he was supposed to have been involved in the suspicions of the victims of the symphony disaster.
In addition, the same came for the replacement of the body in the cells.
The families were forbidden to open the shelves, and there had to be some reason for that.
And that's why they were afraid of scandals because he'd make Polish-Russian relationships worse.
"Keeping good relations at every price, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk an important part of the EU," Kaczynski said on Catholic television Trum.
He added that if the conflict with Russia had been resolved, Tusk would have had the chance to win the most important crisis in the Union, with which Poland still has nothing.
At the same time, Kaczynski declared that he had warned the German Chancellor Angel Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but he did not take it for granted.
The shower has been subjected to eight o'clock hearings on the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
He didn't speak as a suspect at the time, just as a witness.
However, many of his proposals for the hearings were considered to be part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of the Pis Kaczynsk People's Party to discredit Turkey as a political rival by linking various scandals.
In Poland, the Minister of Justice is under the responsibility of the Prosecutor General.
The invitation to the hearing came after the election of Tusca, the head of the European Council, who was actively seeking to prevent Kaczynski from visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of the Turkish mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová was protesting personally.
In this case, Varshaw left for the Holillas and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs love?
In the Southern Parliamentary elections, the registration of voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the talks from Barmy, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It is from a statement that manages the delivery of votes in foreign languages.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, which is currently in the memoranda.
Four years ago, a delegation was elected abroad to 10,000 Czech citizens.
"Since the last update of the statement in 2013, there has been some changes that should be considered in these lists," explains the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"In some countries, new representative offices have emerged, some have been closed, where appropriate, to change the level of representation," says the material.
The report shall contain two annexes, the first of which are set out by the representative authorities to which the ballot papers are submitted.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, then Germany, Poland, Russia and Slovenia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a voter in the press version.
They're just on their list with a list of changes.
Four years ago, Czechs could choose, for example, the Czech Republic in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassys are closed.
Czech Republic also withdrew its representation in the Malaysian Bahamas and Japan.
Love won't even be at the General Consulate in Donek.
This Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are new to the list of ambassadors in Kenyan Nairobi, the capital of the Senegalese city of Dakar and the Zambian Lusaka.
In Asia Česko, from the last parliamentary elections, has expanded its representation of the general consulate in Iraq and Čcheng, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-čchuan.
Voting leaves will also be available for registered voters in the Czech Republic in Barmé and Cambodia.
The Czechs had the opportunity to choose a delegation at the optional places at the representative offices or consulates four times before.
Before each elections, the National Electoral Commission shall appoint a country for which candidates are voting abroad.
This was first in 2002, when it was decided between the South Moravia candidates.
In the following two elections, the Czechs went abroad among South-South candidates.
In 2013, the Middle East was also elected as the year.
The number of Czechs voting in foreign is rising steadily.
At the 15-year-old prime minister, a total of 3800 people were voting, about 6700 in 2006, four years later 8222.
The previous snow volleyballs four years ago were sent to the Embassy of 10,571 voters.
Mascar at Moore's Ford: The activists remembered racist links
Ford Mercuriy, from 1948, visited the visiting residents of Monroe, Georgia, and codified with the Bridge of Moore's Ford.
However, before the car was hit by four passengers of black fur and a white driver, a group of white men who were armed took his way to the bridge.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in broken clothes - took a lot of cigarettes and looked at the front of the car.
There's a kind of fear inside.
"We want it n--a Roger!" said the man.
"Bring him to me!"
Quietly cuts off a young black man's neck, which is cut off from his partner's seat.
This scene is the only reconstruction event that came on 22 July.
But when one of the men passes through the Roger's church, the promise will come to an end.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford bridge has been returned regularly to a group of activists who rebuild that fateful night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been close to murder.
"It is with the conviction that for all those years the only person has been arrested - although we still see them in our community; and even if we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to reorganise events, was allowed to hear about it.
"It's a mystery to our history and a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressman in Georgia and a lifelong warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes, he is reconstructing a dramatic challenge to driving, and every year the city of Monroe remembers that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand judicial action and the closure of the case, we want peace of mind and peace, but righteousness above all," Brooks said.
"To date, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
The court doctor is hiding one of the victims of the murder on 27 July 1946 at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI, which received a report from the NBC News, the merger was to involve up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding periods.
But no one's been so excited yet.
Despite the fact that suspicions remain after decades of freedom, citizens' rights advocates claim that both causes of political unrest and sex - were known to all citizens.
On the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court of the Black Plains of the state of Georgia in April 1946, the first right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer was granted.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the farmer had black hair Roger Malcom during the race to raise the owner of the land white hair Barnetta Hestera - apparently because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was believed that Hester had buried his wife, Dorothy, and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on June 25, 1946, the most important owner of the land was the White Plain Loy Harrison for Malcoma, a cashier of $600.
He was sent to the prison by Dorothy and the Mae Murray brothers and George Dorsey.
On his return from prison, just before he went to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects had stolen their way.
"As it turned out, murder planned and organized Harrison," the FBI produced.
"It is also evident that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law defenders who have not only participated in the secret, but have also escaped the evidence and detained the identity of witnesses."
Brooks showed more expertise in the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for voluntary law," he said.
"Always had a clear subtext for all the local residents of the Black Valley: ‘This is what you will do if you register and go to the Volit’."
The annual event reconstruction at Moore's Ford Bridge is organised by Cassandra Greene.
Its presentation is visual, poetic and exhilarating. It shows the depth of the deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider in modern America to be extinct.
Following this reconstruction is not easy and it's even harder to get the air, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about secretion, because we have to deal with unpleasant feelings that are hidden within each of us," Greene said.
"However, the relationship cannot arise between us if you do not listen to what I had to go through."
The main annual reconstruction trials began in June, and on the first day about 30 heroes - thousands of whites, the rest of the blacks - were gathered to a room where Greene met with a very well-planned presentation.
Wade Marbaugh runs the position of the assistant director.
For many years the leader of Kukuluxklán has played a role, but according to his word, he is an exciting one.
"I have a bad feeling because it contradicts who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to return to such a time."
The Hercis Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, the poet of Barnetta Hester, have grown their role.
The presentation begins with the poem - Malcom agrees with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land--e!"
Rascona isn't.
He's coming to the basement.
At this point everyone (at least every black hair) is smiling.
Greene's laughing at everything.
"What happened?" Rascona said.
He's confused.
I was too rude?
'No,' said the Greene's pleasure.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'n-r' to such a tone."
"Exactly," one of the Hermes will cut off the black hair.
"You've got to have a bigger reason for R."
Energy in the room is better at once; friendship is rewarded by a feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants it to be authentic, just to be made up of enough four victims of massacre.
Hearts repeat the scene.
Rascona is now a source of encouragement to the correct expression of the word to N.
No one laughs anymore.
The presentation ends violently and fast.
Grew, shot... and set up silence.
Women dressed in black stand over the flesh of the priests and sing a tired song of Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there's a feeling in the room.
Behind all of this, about a thousand watching people lose their way and tears from their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites.
A couple arrived from New York City, many of whom were in attendance from the nearby area.
Each of them breathes a local wave of about eight hours and Brooks leads to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
By this time the murder could have been watched by the retreat, but now, standing in the same place where it came to the landing, the atmosphere is terrible.
With the last words, the song calls on Greene's taxes to monitor the inspection of the body.
The children walk to the victim's head, follow false blood and invisible bodies, and spit something in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy sighs.
He's gonna run away for a few minutes and Greene's thanks for the promise.
The hearts are in the lano and they're shaking their throats.
Bradshaw covers Marbaugha, a man in his suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona includes his two friends-hers and pays off in their arms; eventually his emotions fall on him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's your role.
But you had reason for it."
She'll be sitting with the priest for dinner the same day.
At one table, a young white couple are engaged in the presentation with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski's nephew found words that would express her feelings from today's presentation.
"It's hard to listen to these shocking words and look at the horrible effects... that people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that secretion is still a topic," added, "only the police lines are called."
On the other hand, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the court's seat, talking about the civil rights of the people.
According to his own words, he has already begun to plan the presentation for the next year.
"Reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment of thought," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to its restoration."
I like instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use are only a scratch.
I don't agree, though.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often drawing surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything were more rare.
So maybe my first gramophone contained only one paper on which the hieroglyphics showed the connection of some parts, all of which contained some secret signs.
After years of showing me something inside, I offered that letter of the scheme, which was not afraid to clear the back desk.
He gave me a tip on which the paper with the labyrinth is appropriate.
Yes, it was a regular help at the chronic deposition of toilet paper.
The game found a broken wire and enabled me to hear the expensive vinyl plates again.
A new era has brought new guidelines.
And the relatively simple fruit picker, where he just kept a cross, demanded about ten pictures.
In particular, it was a map with a description of how to insert one piece into another.
The adjustment was double and the other procedure was simply not possible.
Giving it was clearly necessary to make significant efforts with the need to separate certain parts of the plastic.
My rejection of the instructions ended in my self-examination of Seat Leon's character.
The year of production 2003 was still such a booklet with a hint of minor adjustments, which included among other changes to the glass lamp.
It was simple.
All three steps and the work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author recalled that while the fire was actually changing, only in three steps did it change.
1st division of cover.
2. Make an empty fireplace and make a new one.
3. Name has been changed.
The left arm had a problem in the way the battery's cover was placed.
At first, I thought I was going to put the right top ends into the van in front of some supplies, the screws that they were covering easily and then I'd already run points 1-3 of the author of the service books.
I guess it's feet.
The cover had no place, no room, no room for the glass of the Popelčin arm, and then the General Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and that's all without any success.
The status was still strengthened by my wife's access to the garage, which she called the river and the words that I heard from my mouth quite exclusively.
"What are you doing here?"
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I give up my vulgar terms, there were only two public statements.
I've got my fever.
"And why does it take you so long?" she threatened a victory that could be her last in a long-term contest.
I gradually explained to her the problem, and I was very grateful for the author's torture procedure, where the burning iron on her hand, which she wrote, followed by her tears, that he could never write anything anymore, was the only introduction to the wide scale of Kladiva's instructions to the witch, including his commissional fire on the top of the Losin castle.
"What's this way to fix this box?" said the woman of the battery installation.
In the fourth anniversary it came and then steps 1-3 were as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And that's the day my colleague called, who just got out of the collapsing position after checking two state medical officers.
I know her as a colleague who has lived in the area as a potential and impossible and who can express the wild story with unspoiled voice.
"I imagine I've got a sentence because I don't have a hint on my hand," he said with a weak voice.
I gradually got rid of the whole problem that caused him to think that I had no idea what to do with the patient's toilet.
Its argument to the Commissioner that adults with their hands are capable of doing well, and that there is no need for icons to control that ordinary people's activities, there is no great effect and there is no small amount of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simply filling the preferred means of running water is a primitive act at the level of chromatology that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, conducts this order in ten steps.
So it's necessary to tell you that it's necessary to get out of the water hole.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but finally it's a happy finding that a man has washed his hands just as he arranges for his hosudree from Suklu.
Finally, I have to realize that I was going to let myself breathe and prepare a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
In the matter of demilitarisation, the procedure is uniform, where the problem does not arise, given the certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to draw up two guidelines.
The problem remains those pictograms, because creating a perfect process also means the exact approach of all the atomic details, which could wake up in the former visitor's toilet of certain distortions, because it can finally be learned that he has been exposed to the proper opening of the entire life of his life by a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson company leaves more than 3,000 employees and reduces dividends in order to revive trade
On Friday, the British teaching group Pearson indicated that it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme with a view to changing the trade model.
Another voluntary exemption, which, according to Executive Director John Fallona, will come at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision to leave 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce the costs of another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May under the third programme to reduce the costs in order to establish a sharp trade resulting from the development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, indicated that the annual outlook remained unchanged after reporting a percentage increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Flight to the Kavu in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military army in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. During the attack, one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, the official representatives indicated.
There were five soldiers and a bully, mentioned in NATO's statement.
According to informal reports of an attack in the city of Qarabagh, three civilians were also killed.
This month, the Afghan bomb attack was launched - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday at the explosion in the city of Herat.
On Monday he killed a suicide bomber near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In its statement, NATO stated that the attack occurred after the surveillance of the Afghan army had been carried out with the “local person with the home of the explosive device”.
The declaration further states that all injuries of soldiers are beyond the threat of life and are found in the U.S. military hospital on the basis of Bagra.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a significant source of concerns about NATO's related forces in the nearby Bahamas.
According to the UN, 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the main city.
At the end of July, the bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia Kabul Square.
The Taliban reported to the attack.
On May 31, he killed more than 150 people in the center of town. It was the most deadly military attack in the country since the United States of America broke down the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is already undermining the situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering the increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks that occurred in recent weeks by public trust in the government, its regulations and, in particular, its reputation as President Ashraf Ghanín.
In response to the complaint, EPA revised its decision to remove the rules of dumping
The U.S. Agency for the Protection of the Environment has withdrawn its decision on compliance with the Obama Administrative Act, which ordered the States to reduce emissions, which is only the day after the agency complained to 15 States.
At midnight, the EPA announced its decision on the establishment of the 2015 Ozone Standards, stating that it is proposing the Agency's commitment to co-operation with the State.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and listen to their views," stated EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's efforts to remove ozone-depleting standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine, on the basis of measurement, the limits to be met by October 2018.
The group of fifteen from most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday on the grounds that EPA conduct is illegal.
President Donald Trumpa's administration is strengthening the blockage of many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trumpo's words in an effort to achieve economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have begun countermeasures by democracies and conservative groups who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its websites states that breathing with ozone content "can lower the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The Ladislav Bubnár song got the morning and the blood ran!
This, in our relatively new song, you may already have recorded this year in June of this year, when this very unknown song was arranged by us to the Czech dimension of the monster action that hosted such pre-privity as Mr. Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainova and many others, and the action was not modulated by anyone other than Leoš Marès.
The aim was to show the audience and present your musical video clip to the song Sara, whose baptism was just named.
Few, however, know that the video clip itself that was in Russia did not occur without problems and the Ladislav Bubnár song itself had to be healed.
It was his first big encounter with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and did not go without a proper trap.
The song of Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, in a video clip of songs of juice, he had to mark his face.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into his nose that the young singer had to heal the doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, immediately I got out of my nose," Ladislav remarked the situation.
My colleagues and producers said that the situation was bad and Ladislav didn't react in time.
Unfortunately, the injury was not so serious that it would affect the progress in the next phase.
We now bring you a named young artist's video clip, and you can also record that scene with the title.
Unreported version of blood, however, was not better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at a meeting on the possibilities of mutual double
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could make up the most interesting boxer game in the light bag, first met at the afternoon meeting.
Each of them was located in a private room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, while Garcia - an undisputed champion in the lightweight World Boxing Council - did not arrive down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomačenka, a champion in the world Boxing Organization.
After Garcia’s victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-year World Championship of Adrian Broner on the showtime Saturday, the two boxers got on the list of five best boxers in easy weight.
Garcia took her hat and said: “How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
On Saturday at 19: 00 a.m., the Lomačenko will be entitled to the ESPN by Miguel Marriaga.
Boxeries take photos and manager Lomačenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential boxer file would be “a perfect test”.
"I'm a former champion in the iron chain," explains Garcia.
"I had to pick up with Broner (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
My 63 kg is small.
I'd like to go back to the light weight category.
The hunter has to go back to get on a light weight... so we can run.
After that, he's in pain.
Why don't they do it?"
He agrees.
"Box would win this game."
The climate has made a requirement for payment for sightseeing - which is part of its strategy. The Lomacian should complete his debut in a light weight at the end of the year and the next year run with Garcio (37-0.30 knots), which also expressed interest in the match against the victory of George Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who runs on 23 September on the title in the light weights in the Forum.
"The game should take the form of a look-in payment, it requires fans," said Garcia, who later expressed himself that it was an open opportunity to broadcast the game through a television station that will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will take that kind of attention.
We're waiting for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomačenka as "a wonderful boxer" and could participate in his Saturday party.
I don't know, but I didn't give Garcia's credit when he said that the champion three divisions from Riverside seemed "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about the bone."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers indicated that they felt the tension ahead of each other.
"Just don't forget this game.
There's no other game that's so much attention left to itself.
And I'll put a lot of light into the fire," said Garcia.
He said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a stop.
Their cars are now on Volhy's lake.
Two young Russians, Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
There's been a huge turnout after them, but there's no success.
And the police finally stopped the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple certainly didn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the whole story came.
The sound of their car found a light tap on the bottom of the Volhy River in the city of Cheboksary in Chuvaška.
Only thanks to the evidence left in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The evidence survived the entire decade under water, without which the police would have to find out for a long time the validity of the findings.
A couple were last warned when Zirnov bought a car from his father so that he could get his friend out of work.
The trigger that the car has detected is still in anonymity.
His search was announced by the Czech police, who drove the next day to the beach.
The researchers believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that caused the narrow road along the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been described as a new method of ageing, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as an 18-year-old, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rätttsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of the year.
The aim of the method is to assess the applicant’s application for asylum. The measures were submitted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for landing when determining the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
By today’s date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of 2481 tests conducted from the mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was assessed as older than 18 years, while in the other 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency claimed that the question was “may be older than 18 years”.
In other 423 cases, it was decided that the question was “maybe 18 years younger”.
Tests shall be available only if the age of the requested dispute.
According to Johanna Gåranson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"On the contrary of last month, statistics are kept in busy circles and figures are very similar," said The Local.
The higher the number of asylum seekers, the age of 18 years, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and indicated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned is 18 years or older”.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined 581 published cases and found that 243 cases indicated that it would be 18 years old.
Critics were also expected to determine the age of age, which includes the X-ray of the teeth of wisdom and the MRI scan of the knee nodes, which are then taken by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is also involved in considering people's biological maturity to a age when the person concerned went to puberty.
"I had reason to think about this problem, and I do not think that these types of measurement for age assessment are correct.
It is very uncertain that the age of biological age is certain.
If we can't determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend again," said the Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medicine Agency’s Göransson rejected the decision: “It can usually be said that the risk of misevaluating your child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person in question is strictly under 18 years of age, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all the respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico's phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, on the iron phone of Mexican President Enrique Penov Niet, threatened that he would not meet if he publicly said his country would not pay for the construction of the wall between the United States and Mexico.
The trumpet in the speech said that the funding would be arranged in some way, even though it would have to be secured from other sources.
He also spoke openly with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from a record of conversations that was published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the building of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his Dutch campaign.
Immediately in the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after his arrival at the Trump Money Neta non-diplomatically charged that he was critical of his plan to build a wall.
The southern neighbour seemed to be a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said again in a discussion on January 27th, and threatened to cut off contact with the Mexican president, if he continues to issue an updated statement.
The funding is kind of in the first place, and eventually it's gonna work.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to talk to your gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," said American journalist Trump.
Now he has identified at least the important thing we're talking about, but politics may be the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall of Trump issued shortly after taking over power.
Mexico's construction and financing of the wall is rejected for a length of 3200 kilometres, and the relationship between the two countries has been won.
At the end of the Trup market said the project would still be paid to the United States.
The storm finally met with its Mexican conqueror first at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also announced a telephone interview with the Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28th.
The head of the White House's conversation marked a funny turnout.
In conclusion, it adopted an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees to the United States to adopt persons from international installations in Pacific States.
The trup of the deal first considered it foolish, later he joined it.
"You can definitely say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passports, a telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost romantic, for example when Trump assessed as a good idea of Australia’s refusal to accept the members’ flag salutes.
"You're worse than me," shouted Trump.
But this is where the tone of the conversation has grown.
"I hate taking these people," said Trump.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people who are going to work for local milkers," he said.
In the discussion, he also suggested that an outlaw could become an observer for Boston in five years.
The storm led to the end of the winter, and then a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world states, often within a day.
The talk with Turnbull finally marked at least the most pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he found that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
Before the house, they repaired the murder of Rany.
Her father also came.
The repair went on in the main city of Jemena Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose for his victim the little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi married a girl, took her father's house, where he raped her and laid his hands on her.
And then he raped her body, and then he went to the closet.
The violent death of young girls has infected the whole country, which is facing the threat of civil war.
Jahya Almatari was in the first series of thousands of donations that came to bear witness to reform.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was condemned under the law of the Sharia.
The father of the victim delivered his emotions to the media.
I feel like I'm born again.
I got caught.
It's a new day of my life.
And the other members of the family were present, along with the tax, calling out the word "to live justice".
The rapist brought a police supply that was pulled out of the place.
The police put him in the chest.
One of his officers turned his gun against him and dropped the ball out of his immediate vicinity.
The next tax was celebrated every morning that was burned.
Mr Almatari told the MailOnline that justice was executed in accordance with the legal system of the country.
"Justice, Allah, and the law of magic have triumphed," he added.
I was at the Rehabilitation Center in Sana and I was waiting for my daughter's murder to be repaired.
Then we went to the convent with our family.
We took Ranino's little body and buried him on a nearby graveyard.
Me and my wife, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been executed.
The police were afraid that the tax collected on the site would fall to hate madness, murder would fall, and it would get worse.
The correction was made by a judge who is under the management of the Huts of the Czech Republic.
At first, however, Maghrib was immediately sentenced to 100 wounds in battle, but his actions raised such indignation that the judge decided to execute death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on 27 June.
His family's wounds knew him well.
When the police were looking for his house's door, they revealed evidence that his husband had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
And the animals would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that happened to Ranino's body was terrible," said the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, and that day we reported it to the police, we said it to the news and to all our television stations, crying with her photo everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a guy from the murder parents who suspected their son of a horrible act.
His mother's daughter, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body was found.
The morning she was going out to play with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he is.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the car and drove around, but we were looking for the sea.
The people of Yemen were convicted and began to gather before the police station where al Maghrib was detained and demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice has read the present report of the investigation to calm it down.
The accused did not apologize for everything he did.
Just before his execution, the police had read his sentence, but the judge had just looked at his lawyer for a year.
The entire event was scheduled for national television, but on the Internet there were many records of taxes.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a political change
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening the assembly of President Trump that he was moving to the other side.
" Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned to me behind," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after long prayer and meditation, I declare to you today as a West Virginia citizen, that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The presence of watching explosions in happiness.
"I'll report to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a trainer I can tell you, it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had already promised people a meeting in West Virginia an important announcement.
The trumpet won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes magazine, is the only billionaire in the whole country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice built a large property from his father and owned a few fakes down there.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republic issued a statement stating: "The motion of the Governor of Justice is the next morning for a democratic party that prevents us from going on the road, instead of causing us to take our country."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls at least the legislative authorities in history, the announcement of the Governor of Justice is the last cap for a party that is already missing without a leader, who is very determined to find positive and segregating reports," stated RNC Ronna McDaniel in his statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe commends Russia's "intimate" apology for doping scandal
The former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe commended Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that it has not yet set the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athletes Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which was held on the morning of the MS in the athlete - that his country was right from the world of sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who came in this way for gold and silver medals."
Despite its comments to the members of the IAAF Congress, they voted in favour of keeping the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) reports indicate that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we were witnesses today very honest answers and presentations," IAAF Sebastian Coe told journalists.
"All the members of the Council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia acknowledged its mistake and worked hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also “happy” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today we have been very successful and we have come to a different level, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis state on the enforcement of the punishment imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate decent athletes from these wicked ones," he concluded.
The MS in the athlete starting on Friday in London will compete with 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the IAAF rules.
The head of the IAAF Rune Andersen crisis department said on Monday that Russia must still meet several criteria before being allowed to return.
The drug presence tests are still inadequate and trainees continue to carry out their activities, the rapporteurs in London said after the IAAF Council's final presentation.
The CzechTrade State Order has obtained the company Františka Savova, whose state is functioning.
The public order of the CzechTrade national proexport agency was issued by the Young Front Front of Františka Savova.
Officials gave him a percentage of points in all the qualitative criteria.
It was not surprising to them that the Czech state had sued Savo for tax fraud and asked him to go to the Czech Republic.
The Proexport Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade issued a thorough public ban on four-year editing of businessInfo portals.
The contract totalled 30.8 million kroner issued by the Young Business Front of Františka Savova.
However, in 2014, the Czech police accused him of being a tax collector and sent him to escape.
Savov moved to Great Britain and Czech Republic asks for his release.
In the case, the server has warned you.cz.
The award of the contract was based on the original criteria of CzechTrade to determine from 60 per cent the price offered and from the remaining 40 competitions of beauty and the quality of the project.
As far as Savo's company was concerned, that second criterion was clearly helpful.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz has achieved hundreds of points in all partial criteria of quality.
As a result, it was moved before another candidate, the publisher of Vltava Labe Media VLM, who thus offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a share of 404,900 kroner per month, VLM offered 324,350 kroner.
Unlike the Youth front, it was obtained from observers in all quality benchmarks, a total of 62 points.
Tendru continued to participate in BDO Advisors and digital agency R-Media, which also belongs to the current.cz server under the auspices of the Economy.
VLM’s authorities have made several objections to the outcome of the trend with its assessment of zero and insufficient reasons.
Following their refusal, they decided to attack the Agency for the protection of the economic competition of the EEAS.
The CzechTrade is thought to be in conflict with the law.
"The tenderer is convinced that the tenderer has reached a decision on the choice of the tenderer on the basis of the interest rate of the subjective assessment, a single favouring participant of the Young Front, i.e., for tenderers and other tenderers," he wrote on the proposal to initiate the procedure submitted to the EAGGF this week that the server has published Currently.
According to the Director-General and President of the VLM Michala Klími, the selection committee is being held as an unbelievably and percentage of the young front project in all its members as an exceptional suspect.
"Each independent observer has to consider such a remarkable success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," he said to the Current Climate.
CzechTrade has not yet been exposed to the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency is basically unable to comment on public orders before they are closed.
All information about you mentioned are in accordance with the law published in the Prosecutor's Profile and in the Public Contracts Report.
"After the end of the contract, a full written message will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express ourselves to it," said Dotyk.cz media representative of the agency Štěpán Longowý.
The young front responded to a statement which, according to it, considers it extremely problematic that the issuers of the Economy are engaged in an article in the current.cz competition where they have their own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that Article.
In the tender she could help by providing the BusinessInfo portal in the past four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martin Cuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police for tax losses in relation to the excessive amounts of DPH to his company, which caused the Czech state a certain damage to up to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic has asked the Great Britain to issue it since 2014.
According to Savova, he is a criminalized chief of the ANO Andrej Babish, under whose influence Mafra's publishing is in force.
The London Court of Justice of Loni Savovo refused to object to the issue, but the businessman refused.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere, from Great Britain, we have not yet received any explanation in the matter of obtaining legal power," said Štépánka Zenklov, a spokesman for the Prague City State Representative.
In addition to the property of the Young Fronts, Savov in the Harvestor Limited company has a seat in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech Republic's Pivovar Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is described as an investment fund, buying threatened assets.
He would also have to run the Heavy Machiney Services company, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the acquisition of property from a former Socialist youth.
The engine ran through the corridors and the parking lot, ended up in the trailers.
The motorist turned his attention to the streets, the walkways and the parking lots in the Sušoviči.
When the monitor began to track him, he decided to take her to the Station.
"The police men followed with increased caution when, on one of the next streets behind the Marians of Lazní, they did not manage and the motorcycle entered the field where he had been threatened," said police spokesman Daniel Dvorák.
At the end of the accident, he also had to fly a rescue helicopter carrying the wounded engine to the gas station.
The police later found that the engine did not own a driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were deleted, its production number deleted and the self-containment was removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"The alcohol presence in the driver was excluded, but the test was found to be a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How financial rules fotball impact transfer Neymara to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will never affect Neymar's record transition from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any criminalisation for Paris Saint-Germany will be carried out by the EUFA organisation, which takes into account the European football teams and has the right to ban the participation of teams in the prestigious League of Masters.
The Financial Fair Law (FFP) , which introduced UEFA in 2011, stipulates that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transition has not been financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has only paid EUR 222 million in order to buy Neymara out of its contract and Neymar will claim a fee of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
In view of the fact that the PSG team is funded by a rich xartic family that has enriched energy sales, it can allow Neymara to be brought to the already star football family.
Clubs may be lost for buying large amounts of players, but on the other hand they must show legal sources of revenue, which enable them to cover the government costs of photo-related business activities.
The FFP introduced Michel Platinin after reaching UEFA's headquarters in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that owe themselves to the new forces would ultimately undermine and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules focused their attention on the club debt to monitor their losses.
This change meant that the trading model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and losing the warm sum for players y to build a global brand - it was not so good at all.
In the current three-year period ending in 2018, clubs can show up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Alexander Čeferin, was willing to refuse the ban on excessive loss.
"The FFP has continued to pay and we are determined to strengthen it in the future," said last week for Associated Press Andrea Traverso, which looks at compliance with the FFP rules.
Although the PSG has purchased the amount for the purchase of Neymara in a single payment, the amount may be distributed for the purposes of calculating the amount for the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the translation can be written at EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of FFP's highest sanctions was launched in 2014 with the PSG with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG carried out a fine of EUR 60 million (82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and the order to reduce the crew of the Masters League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25 players.
UEFA pays attention to teams that can try to treat financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies connected with the owner of clubs.
Even though the cash company sponsors the PSG as long as funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amounts.
In 2014, UEFA joined the same measure, which decided that the higher funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of the Neymar income in the PSG could be threatened by some reports by the MS organisational commission in the 2022 photoball in Qatar.
However, the PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar argued that Neymat should be a MS ambassador in the football game and that such a manager would easily expose UEFY agents.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to enforce the rules,
According to UEFA, a dedicated person expressed yesterday did not initiate any investigation of Neymara's approach to the PSG.
The source of this report sought to remain anonymous, since it was not justified to comment on the situation with PSG, the agency The Associated Press introduced it.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling clothes.
The club shall make a contract of up to 30 per cent.
The representatives of the Spanish League, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the largest stars, were concerned about measuring Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG violates the FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of the 'financial doping' club and the state," said the president of the League Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the property of the PSG club as a cash union.
Manager Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnet, shares the same position as La League on the financing of the club.
"This is the result of property that has changed the football world in the last 15 years from the foundation," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as the owner of the club can stand, everything is possible.
Keeping the rules of the financial fair play is very difficult because the state can have different interests at the participation of such players in its club."
Joint Agent Rosic: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Six thousand foot-and-mouthed fans.
Tomaš Rosicky's going to the beach.
Same scene as in Sunday's fight against Bohemians.
The partner's client was running away from the Red Star game, thinking of several heads, but his co-players didn't target the blacks.
The flight team, driven by new multi-million troops, will end up in the European fires.
Was it hard for me to do anything else after the Belgrade branch?
After the incarceration, four shots had to be shot, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose it, to raise our self-conscious mind so that we could get back to the next game.
We had some chance.
We need to work together as a team and play our game.
Why didn't Sparta be able to get to the pool so long?
The game's very well-trained.
The competition combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we fired about once in a while.
Of course, it's very small when you have to win two or three balls.
The second half has been much better, we've been able to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push the opponents more often to such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the set?
Of course, it's one of the diseases when a new man is created.
We've only played three competition games and we've always been changing.
It's about the trainer finding an ideal unit to sit down.
Are you excited that you've already played part of the two games after you?
It's still just part of the escape.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can play it all the time from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have occurred in the Sparta?
We have to be, or it won't be.
It's the same as injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't go back.
Sparta decided something, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will get worse.
The ghosts came back to a great number, but they went to the ruins.
What can you show them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them feel better.
Bring in something for which they'll come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Could a season without fire be at least an advantage for the league?
We're still fighting ourselves, we're hiding, so it's not that good for us.
For an extreme tax union, the entrepreneur has to spend ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the difficulty of the business of Jiří Toman, who had to pay a significant amount of ten years in prison.
The estimated damage is 645 million kroner.
Toman, in his difficulty, claimed that justice violated his fundamental rights, effective detection of courts in Zlin and Olomoci are too imperfect.
However, the Constitutional Court identified the difficulty as irreparable, found the ČTK from the Court's database.
The Court is no longer a court of appeal.
"It shall not be considered as a fourth instance of effective or legal errors which have been expressly allowed by the general courts if they do not represent a breach of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was as close as he was to the top.
Verdit is valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Verdit Court in Olomoci.
At that time, Toman was in the publishing service in Argentina, where he was found on the basis of the resolution at the time of the decision of the EU.
The penalty imposed is on the upper limit of legal fees, which, according to the value, is due to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court identified the case as an extreme tax deficit, which has even a macro-economic impact on the state budget.
He served as president of the World Service company from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million kroner was due only for the period from January to July 2008, a total unit, according to the scientist, exceeded the billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Tom as a whole.
According to the complaint, the World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax recognition.
Instead of the monthly DPHs and the consumption tax in rows of at least ten million kroner, the tax was paid in only statistics.
The World Service and some companies with whom the company was trading have a relationship with the President of the Council, whose case was determined by the law to be machined with DPH in the 13 years of imprisonment.
He also rejected his difficulty before the Constitutional Court.
The series “Firth to Non-Discrimination” and “Comrade Detective” are playing on the nostalgic page
This story is nostalgic as for the positions of the famous 80s; both for the 90s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy scale “The State”); and of course for the modern age, especially the year 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poeherov and Paul Rudd turned to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a simple parody and also a strengthening of our modern Facebook memories.
From the French point of view, it looks like someone's breathing.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well – not only because of absurd humor (for example, it can be a story of the origin of the talk to the green man named H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors turned away from the main funny points - mid-year-old heroes who play adult children - and couldn't cope with the past.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later”, in which adults play adult netting so much on the emotional level and satira is a place to be sporadic, including parody on the thrillas of the 1990s as “Hand on the bicycles”.
In one moment, it will be found at the Apple Powerbook's graveyard, cyclists, and "a set of other things since 1991".
Many of the main historical lines are repeated.
The generous Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has not yet moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
It's not about the crazy equipment included by Ronald Reagana (also Mr. Showalter), which is promoted by George H. W. Bush (very well equipped Michael Ian Black).
As always the best parts of French are many more distant stories.
It is especially fun to watch young Rudda with long hair alias is made by Matt Dillon from the movie Young, which sometimes shows Andy's respect for old paper.
France could start moments of craziness, as we should repeat the series “Seven Up” until it comes to what I think will be a logical explanation: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, when the whole group is finally released at the “Air to the Non-Discrimination” Prime Minister.
"Comrade Detective" in Amazon calls for another type of nostalgia: revivalism of the study of the series "So normal American", the film "Atomic Blonde: No suffering" and even the series "Glow", where icons of east and west awakening scenes appear.
The comedy of the artists Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in the Rhyse Thomas regime is a television scene: a drama of two Hungarian police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism through Marxism-Lenism.
The main role of Gregory and the idealist Joseph is to play Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, who contributed to the English language Channing Tatum (executive serial producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
I'm sorry, but it's not too much.
In some jokes you laugh (as the police follow-up chess on television - parody on American football).
The series won the voice of many famous heroes - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, focuses too much on the unscathed propaganda drama - which includes the killing with Reagan's mask - and it also seems.
Six long episodes are too exciting and not enough comedy moments.
In a shorter stage, propagandaistic satiries in the "Comrade Detective" could operate, for example, in the scene where Gregor and Joseph once again visit the United States, in which two weights of hamburgers are collected at a large gathering.
The clear message for the imaginary communist promise is that Western culture can change everything in the cave and the Orgy.
The Romanian people's thinking was not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with them.
The fleets did not wait for the cancellation of the IAAF command.
The International Atlantic Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian carriers for a State-supported smoking programme.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which will begin on Friday, was expected to be very unique.
For the extension of the ban, 166 delegates spoke against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the refusal is the fact that Russia will not be able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted by the Chief of the IAAF Rune Andersen Special Investigation Group prior to the Congress.
His group recommended that the order continue.
Some older shooting cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard and trainers are still working in the country with a shameful record.
Not even the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can carry out a test under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot more work to be done," said the president of IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, and the Russian athletes came outside of the London Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In spite of the requirement of the existing MS, 19 Russians have participated, who have already demonstrated that they have been tested longer than the Russian anti-doping system.
But they won't be able to start in national colors, and in the event of victory they won't win a Russian himm.
The Bank of England will support the rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to notify that the rate rate will remain unchanged, following an unexplained economic growth and slow inflation, which has contributed to speculation about early growth.
The Bank of England has ensured that economic growth will remain "back" in the context of maintaining interest rates - despite the expectations of family budgets.
The policy makers of the Committee on Change Policy (MPC) Banks England voted six to two times to maintain the rate rate at 0,25 %. The results of the vote in order to increase the rate of the rate supported by poor growth supported by the low rate.
In its annual report on bank inflation, the Bank announced an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, ensuring that family budget reductions will continue. The Bank expects inflation to grow below 3%.
The Bank also pointed out that, over the next few years, there should be growth due to inflation caused by Brexit and also indicated that there should be more economic growth than expected from mobility.
The members of the committee also voted in favour of the removal of the part of the mother package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above above, it should start to pay from the next unit the Terminated Financing Plan, which will offer the Bank of England's cash supply, even though the Bank of England has indicated that it will now offer EUR 15 billion less than the planned $115 billion.
Just before the bank’s decision, the Bank stated: “MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (HDP) will, from a short-term perspective, be combined with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption.”
On the basis of the Bank's proposal, it would be necessary to "retain the accounts of monetary policy" to slow down inflation, which is "in a higher degree" than the market is expected.
Markets currently predict the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and the next growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be “allowable” and “limited”.
The Bank has reduced the forecast of growth for the year and the next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The expected growth in 2018 remained unchanged at 1,8 %.
After publication, the bill is signed against the dollar and the euro.
Freedom of choice is 0.5 % of $1.31 and 0.4 % of EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain the existing status was followed by a dramatic increase in expectations for further growth - HDP stopped at 0.3 % in the second quarter of the turnover of 0.2 % in the previous three months.
The growth with high probability will remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter, although by the end of the year the bank's statement should be slightly increased.
The most recent report on inflation is a sudden relief for households affected by inflation and a massive increase in payments. The Bank indicated that the situation was worse before growth.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the reduction of income in the coming years, but it is expected that they will be "excellent" at the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow thanks to the great interest of the British product in terms of low librarians, which compensates less than a percentage of consumer expenditure.
This Decision came in the year following the fall in the last year in August at 0.025 % in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to the decline in librarians.
The Bank estimates that the full price and economy integration takes at least four years.
Before the decision on the most recent rates, many requested an increase in rates with rising inflation, which further increased domestic pressure, and three policy makers requested an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month fell back to 2.6 % of the red 2,9 %, although the bank indicated that it expected such a change and that in the next month it would have to be re-entered.
The Bank indicated that the overcrowding relative to 2 % of the target was "all" due to weak libres.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, stated: “In view of the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only get worse as long as the creditors begin to compete with the ban with a view to the end of the year.
The market seems particularly good for those who end up in existing contracts and mortgages - the offer offers are free of charge, as well as the low rates they obtain."
NHS predicts HIV Controversy in 10,000 patients
Patients have access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention based on the decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) pill used before sex and reduced the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86 per cent will be offered through the health service in approximately 10,000 patients during the third trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance an experimental period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the last year stating that the NHS had financial resources to compensate the PriEP despite the declaration that the medicine should be financed by the local authorities.
The decision notified on Thursday was adopted by NHS England by Director-General Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’ while the National Aids Trust (NAT) decision described it as a ‘extended moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to take patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented by April 2018 throughout England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
The pre-sex application means that there is enough specific medicines to prevent infection in the patient's body.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify capable participants who sign consent with the participation in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and partners with whom HIV status is not already controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registering in the GP in the United Kingdom can also be enrolled in their local sexual health clinic and be able to participate in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers for £10 million and NHS England signed this week's contract to distribute medicines after obtaining international public orders.
The experimental period is intended to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PrEP, its objectives, use and implementation in a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be complemented and fully developed by an ever-increasing and, therefore, more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milkman in more than three hundred years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: ‘We are witnesses of the decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PreEP is administered properly and in patients at risk, the possibility of changes in the English HIV epidemic is offered.
NSH will be offered to patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool, which is individually controlled and independent of the need to talk to a partner, leading to improved quality of many lives.
We accept this declaration with joy."
Ian Green, executive director Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘The primary number must be rapid testing across the country; we must ensure its availability for each patient.
We are now available as an experimental product of PrEP and are on a good path to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
The Chinese Ministry of Health Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the experimental period of PrEP is a welcome and long-term change in monthly expenses and maintenance by the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be part of our HIV prevention approach and the elimination of this life-threatening infection.
The next tests will bring us closer to full understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect individuals who have been exposed to HIV and thus end HIV spread in society.'
Life on high feet: mezipatro and smart design changed this small apartment at Earls Court in the local houses
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with your property, changed a large house in 2014 in Knightsbridge to stay at Earls Court.
It is located in the first floor of the clever Queen Anne terrace - and is an observational show of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge Square," said Joanne.
“I looked for something more reasonable.
I found this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height.
I fell in love with him right away, and I ran on him the same day."
Since that time, the apartment has been over 1,000 meters of total renovation.
One-bedroom apartment with a complicated parking lot - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - wanted Joanne to add the dining room and the mezipatro to use a high ceiling.
“I used a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
These were my demands," she said.
To this end, Erfan Azadi from the design and design study Duck & Shed sat in Notting Hill and used nearly four meters of space to create houses that were not only a project but also a place to live.
The stream did not reach such heights that two months would pass on to itself - the challenge for architects would thus create a barrier that would be allowed to move forward.
Erfan had to involve his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is complex at all," he explained.
"We had to organize both spaces so we could go straight.
It wasn't just to set up a simple platform, but at the same time to fire the steel structure so that it could rise properly above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to build two fully-qualified rooms for himself - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the meantime, it resembles a beautiful living room of the old median frame in the design of Retrouvius.
The mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro luster Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
A short walk has been taken to look both sides and looks so much further.
The mirror leaves in the kitchen look like a window to other rooms.
In the entry doors, storage spaces shall be located where the measures are taken to harmonize goods and glass.
The exit of the living room, which offers the entire apartment an extremely large area, is possible to separate it from the kitchen if not used.
Sculpture kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this solution, however, are the door-to-doors.
"We had to solve the technical page," Erfan says about the damaged doors.
"The door is designed to prevent it very easily."
Thanks to the wisdom of using the space and storage spaces, Joanne gained another 16 meters of square, second room and better overall renting of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you sell is the usual area - or the valuation of your property," said Erfan.
"The actual broker shall, in principle, calculate its price on the basis of the usual premises when entering the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to raise the usual space in maintaining quality materials that provide a luxury view space.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create emotional tension with the house,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love the construction of electricity in walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts do not win."
As has been shown, quality design and expansion of the living room can change the normal apartment to an exceptional job.
And just like Joanne, you can decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is widening.
California declared its citizens' travel to Tennessee and the other seven states.
The state of Tennessee paid for it and announced a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, there is no objection to a ban in the full meaning that citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout all fifteen states.
One is that California has banned public money on behalf of its citizens to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this nonsense?
California is strong for LGBT and any evidence of non-compliance with the LGBT lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee adopted a law on the benefit of conscience, which states that psychotherapy, which has a moral problem with the treatment of patients from the LGBT community, has no obligation to provide it, but it has a duty for these patients to provide another therapy that does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have also adopted the laws of the religious charitable organization which have received children from their mother after birth to adoption, which do not have the responsibility of these children to provide the adoption of the same sex.
As a result of these laws on the reward of the California conscience, the financing of its citizens' roads to eight countries of the Union from its means was prohibited.
In practice, this means that California professors should not have access to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas spread from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On the way, they have to get either federal grants, but it's absurd that the federal government finance citizens' roads from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has come to be patient and its Parliament has adopted the law by which it also does not like the California policy of high taxes, high government expenditure, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but does not apply to California because of this travel embargo.
It is used as a guide to the California Road Embark on Tennessee.
And the same will happen against any Member State of the Union which would impose a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
At the same time, Parliament has called on all states to stop this madness.
The fact is, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing anti-constitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on revenge of conscience, as well as to decide what their money is going to be and what they should not.
Second, what's wrong with the reward of conscience?
If a hunter has a religious problem selling eggs, why can't he offer only cows, rabbits, pigs and fish?
Why would he be forced under the penalty to sell the enemy if the robbers who offered the enemy were enough?
In Colorado, one baker faces anti-discrimination complaints and a high court because he refused to sign a dot for a gay wedding.
But it also rejects five doors to Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you bring him in and leave him in the room and the appropriate doors don't order him in the hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but the individual states can establish internal, domestic policy in the rights that are not federal, in the interests of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
Only California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, LGBT members of the community at times were right about tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rules of life and let them live where all intelligent people should be guided, but some activists never seek tolerance against themselves or others, even against extreme intolerance against others.
They say that no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if he does so, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're new-time enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history when the states have also acted on political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in times of civil rights struggle, where North and West were on the side of integration and Jih on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
That was the only case in the 50th century, the political cause was childhood, and the North War was fought against Judah.
Of course nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the states of the modern democratic and the states of the Red Republic is widening and the United States is disintegrating mentally.
Unauthorized agitating.
Critic Putin's got a mental arrest.
Russian opposition policy Alexei Navalnyj received 300 thousand rubles to break the rules of the campaign prior to presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court sentenced him to a trial for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, he organized two major anti-government protests and announced that in March of the next year, he wanted to become a head of state.
The managing head of Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidate, but generally it is expected that he will do so and win again.
The officer said the police came to him in the morning and took him to court.
He's done this because he invited people to show video on YouTube's Internet portal.
It's worth three thousand.
"We'll get them out of the judge's pay later," he tweeted on the Twitter criticism of Kremlin.
The Russian Voluntary Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in presidential elections because he had previously been persuaded to vote.
The general, which is considered a fighter against corruption, however, is considered to be politically motivated by the relevant judgment.
Two members of the Naval Pre-Trial Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolay Lišakin, also placed over 25,000 rubles on Thursday.
He went into Russian politics as a anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on a fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign as far as possible.
He was sentenced to a five-year sentence for stealing a wooden company from Kirovles.
In May, the court of appeal confirmed the verdict.
The judgment is so legitimate that the Supreme Court is prevented from applying in accordance with Russian law.
Brothers fight empire at a value of over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of their Italian family empire, claim to be one of the most expensive Victorian properties in the value of $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis live in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paula, who fought for joint property and trade until the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business already in 2014, but the sharp dispute is still before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother, Anna, his own brothers have a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first trade bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
This place was founded by the family of Westco Jeans, who grew into a network of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the entire company sold the family for $85 million.
For the money, other properties were purchased and the family portfolio De Lutis now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers on the property.
Paul owns about one third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is “a significant influence and dominant character” of the De Lutis family, owns not even two thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns $316 million, while Paul repairs property for $176 million.
For Paul, the problem became a direct division of property and financial resources.
"Colin's proposal has been clearly expressed in my eyes in his favour," Paul wrote in a local court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed peace attempts, the first sitting of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers now also argue about who will rule the existing business - from whom Paul said Colin cut off.
Colin argues that this is not the truth and accuses Paul of mishandling certain properties.
In the previous local declaration Colin stated that he believed in a peaceful solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin tells me that the family is one of the most important ones," he wrote.
The costs of the trial are high. The website of local declarations, e-mails and messages from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, provides lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her loyal husband Luigi were Italian passengers who had been carrying milk bars and refrigerators since the 1950s and bought the farm in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when Westco founded "in the last year of high school, Paul was a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to their son would go well.
"Luji often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin stated that Mark was injured at his departure by $10 million and Luke by $26 million.
As Paul, Luke, and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial damage. ”
Colin has been back from that time, despite the fact that he is an ex-member of the AFL club, as noted in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire, knows the television personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisov and their lawyers on Friday.
He only answered Colin by means of a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute was resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to resolve the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, one of the court statements in Colin stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very upset if he saw our current situation," he was left to listen and added that "he's still hoping for a peaceful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will be resolved in a quick time of trial," Colin wrote.
The weather in Czechia.
Teachers feed children.
The MHD drivers make water and summer clothing.
At the Mother's School On Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now coming out on Mondays.
The school is after reconstruction and the exposed trees are still not providing a big wall.
There's no pool there, but the teachers of the children are hanging out in the living room.
In the afternoon, children are staying in classrooms where they have been injured and locked up.
The air is trying to accommodate the clean air because there are no air conditioning.
It's also an order for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature in the interior and outside exceeds the hygienic limits for maternal schools, so in this period we should not even have an open service," said the school director Miloslav Makovic.
In school, there's an empty corridor where the temperature moves around 40 degrees.
We wake up in the morning after 6:00 a.m., the windows are closed, and we have on the southern side of the pain that we protect.
"But it can't help much," he added.
Better conditions are available in the forest school On the Games in Hostivíči, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have growing trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful flower there, there's a table under it, and there's a lot of things to do," wrote the school director Barbara Kompano.
Teachers try to walk to the forest where there is more food.
The children have dark caps and have different games with water on the program.
"We have a hand-pressure questionnaire, which is used for flowering, and we use it for raising children," Kompano said.
The head of the maternity school in the streets of Novoborská on the Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovska also said that teachers try to keep children in the shade and the bodies are water.
"We have a relatively growing garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
It's going out in the afternoon and then up to 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head cover.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweet tea or a sliced juice and have a drink with water on their garden.
Each day, they also have green salads and fresh fruits and vegetables that their parents sometimes bring to them.
"Maybe a mother here today brought about a ten-year-old melon for children," Makovičkja added.
Drivers get water or the same year.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot days of water, iron drinks or summertimes.
Drivers' cabins are also tramping buses are in most cases air-conditioned, says DPP Aneta Greek.
There are air conditioning in addition to the cabins of some trams and in the passenger space.
The tramway rails have never been seriously damaged.
A small injury occurred in the castle of Hostivarí.
At the current high temperatures, we are primarily responsible for providing drivers with sufficient amounts of drinks.
"A glass of drinking water is available in all ponds, strews and trains," said Greek.
In trains and in some resorts, employees have access to sodobars, which produce a frozen soda.
Drivers also get loose protected iron drinks.
"They can also use an annual uniform which increases drivers' comfort during their daily changes," added the speaker.
The hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in increased fires.
On Tuesday, they were liquidated all over Czech, 108, and then twelve long-term average daily.
On Tuesday, when the temperature in Češka was above 35 degrees Fahrenheit [35 ° C], Celsia was in charge of a major firefight.
"The fires in the natural environment, as well as those that are connected with the work of January," said the speaker Nicole Zaralov.
No nightly changes have caused the flow of passengers when the heat on a number of locations has been heated by storms and wave strikes.
In relation to the storm, the storm was driven to 236 steps.
It was particularly about the removal of fallen trees and plants.
"Most of them have taken refuge in the Middle East," Zaralov continues.
But it was also necessary to help trainers in Stockholm, Českolipsk, where 60 people from the children's camp were safely evacuated from the camp because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Persian rescuers.
In the afternoon and in the middle of the night, the sanatorium ran down to ten cases of the area's oxidated with the karate.
That's why people should let their heaters check, protect the rescuers.
Oxide is a colourless fluorescent gas that is released during imperfect heating.
The symptoms of malnutrition include nausea, vomiting, headache, and a feeling of restlessness.
In the event of a suspicion of the holiday, a frozen room should be left.
Trump's new Head of State plans to limit the president of the Media Diet
A lot of people tried it before him, and they always laughed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, it'll be the first one.
Portal Politico stated that the new Head of State in the White House is planning to limit the information provided by President Trupa - including reports on television - in hopes of keeping Trupa cool.
Here's part of the report by reporter Josh Dawseye:
"When the new head of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day in the new function, a key problem arose with the White House Trump, who was willing to do so: incorrect information received by the president.
Kelly told employees that she must personally accept all the information - whether on paper or on a word - because the president can decide better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis really makes sense, but many of his predecessors took control of Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the medium dates back several decades - and now that he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate has been dismissed by honourable reporting countries, it was appropriate to show him that in a positive light, he is talking about a number of other media that was easier to convince," said the former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in honor of Politico.
Tara Palmer from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in the background - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media on which he is being praised."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was sometimes “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these organizers of the campaign know something that the others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more exciting if someone didn't control them.
Of the tweets that Trump never sent, we'll never know with great likelihood.
If his employees were able to keep him at least several times in the back, then their efforts would not go away.
However, no one has been able to stop Trump regularly to raise controversial issues.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of rival groups, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by subduing material - which they can but must not be independent - which supports their view of the world.
The Portal Politico, which covered the problem from all sides, published in May a report on the association of advisers to present false information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's peer reporter:
"The current and former officials of the Trupa claim that the president often reacts strongly to negative media reports, in particular the reports on the exclusion of information, and urges them to find their origin.
The situation came to an end when someone supported the president's copy of the article from GotNews.com - the prosecutor's website, Charles C. Johnson - who accused the president of Katie Walsh's statement that he is a "source of a lot of information" from the White House.
No matter how long Johnson has been exposed from Twitter for charge; or that he has not submitted any evidence; or that he has already made false accusations in the past, and later rejected them.
Trump read the article and began to ask Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the former Head of State Reince Priebus and the Secretary of the White House Rob Porter "have tried to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump".
Would that work?
Kelly is now trying to cross the same strategy three months later.
It may show that he is more effective than Priebus, but Trump's impulse will not just disappear, and his assistants are still very opposed.
These constant factors of Kelly's mission will certainly be very difficult.
Tourists agree on the approach and return to the ‘Millions Square’
Several of the most influential owners of the home in the English county of West Midland will be re-entered in front of the chosen tourists who join the local authorities on the right to re-acquired the field behind their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the ground in the winding streets of Solihull, which is thought to be the ‘Millions Square’.
Bringing horses, children and the army of caravans, tourists return after what was shown in May. They did not miss a chance that was taken to the site on the basis of the regulations of the authorities to prevent their fall.
The tactical group found mercenaries in the army and entered the field with the unguarded mercenary that served as a router.
The fourth citizens attacked the city council of Solihull by ‘the failure to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wanted to stay in anonymity said: ‘ They took this place on the afternoon after they were transferred to the Bentley Heath street where they had dug stones for the rest of the people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Last night, they hit the next one, and today they'll probably get even more.'
He added: ‘Birmingham's board knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to continue to play taxes until the board of directors and tourists is organized.'
Another anonymous citizen said: ‘ It’s funny. We’ve been watching the last traveling tourists lately and they’re back.
And this time it's more of them and this time they brought horses with them."
Solihull's Press Legal Council said: ‘We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to address the whole problem successfully.
In order to gather as many evidence as possible, it is necessary for local citizens to report any ill-treatment or anti-political behaviour on number 101.
We'll get a whole picture that we'll bring to court.'
The husband of the European Parliament broke the car in Brussels.
He brought him a government special.
The government specialty brought the wounded Robert Žitnánski to Bratislav in the middle of the afternoon.
Two satellites were waiting at the airport and the plane was under constant control of the Slovenian doctors.
A long-planned year has gone uncomplicated.
Robert Žitnánski, according to the information TV JOJ at the beginning of the summer, had a serious accident in Brussels.
First he got hit by a car, and since then he's in a serious condition.
After transporting to its territory, one of the fratislavic hospitals was transported to a specialized workplace.
The economic analysis is the wife of the Slovenian MEP Jany Žitnánski by NOVA.
She didn't want to reveal the incident.
He's got three kids together.
Italians are committed to the fight against the saved NGO ship with immigrants on board
Italy notified that it would not be possible for the arrival of rescue ships belonging to the border of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if NMOs did not sign a new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they can continue in their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daili La Stampa.
The warning came the day after the Italian authorities took over the ship by the German rescue organisation Jugend Rettet because of suspicion of trafficking in people, which clearly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which works for the first year, refused to comment on the whole thing on the ground of a complaint by Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartjee.
"It is for us and will always be a priority for the number one saving human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in safe zones at the present time," the organisation said in a statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all the present charges after the collection of all the information and assessment of the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Yuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspicious of the fact that she carried immigrants on board, who were handed over to them by the dealers directly with the people, and it was repeated.
At least one meeting was reported by the applicant only 1.3 miles from the Libya border. During the meeting, Italian media was published.
The ship's crew is suspected of violating the law and treating the Italian coast guard, who looks at rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian surveillance, more than anything else.
The code of conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board the ship, such as Yuventa for monitoring activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations participating in rescue operations have already agreed with the maintenance of the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last-named organisation pointed out on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but friendly, since they do not represent any "substantial change or interruption" concerning saved operations.
For example, the adoption of the new Code of Conduct was rejected by the Free Doctors' Organization (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
At the same time, it was noted that the sudden decline of immigrants in the past few weeks, which occurs in Italy as part of rescue operations, indicates that efforts to strengthen the monitoring of the Libya border and cooperation with local elders bring fruit.
"In the last few days we are starting to watch the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He also identified plans for further meetings that will take place this month with Libya's seniority on economic development initiatives, as well as with the representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who will leave these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Unsatisfied Mesaroša: It was left entirely by silicon and cellulitis!
The hot summer days are full of pleasure, just taking on what's most necessary to hide the most intimate parties.
Only Dominica Mesaroš is doing it wrong.
On Sunday's meeting in the Persian zoo, where it's a hero, moderators, singers and all they have to do with TV Prima, it's just hazy, it's got its body in the mini superal.
And there were only a few regular movements and the model showed everyone their silicones, but also a blessing.
He turned her over several times between half and half, and he showed her so high that she had to keep fixing it.
She had no need to pay attention to the gentlemen and the photographers who were present.
Michelle Carter is judged for sending text messages that promote the murder of Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for committing suicide by means of text messages and telephone calls.
Twenty-five-year-old Michelle Cartero will be held 15 months from the double-year sentence on the grid and then spend five years in the conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the indiscriminate murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is torn apart.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was released until the decision was made.
She was threatened by 20 years of freedom, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red shirts and cream blouse, Carter stood on the ground with tears in his eyes, his hands covered, and his eyes directed toward the ground.
"Your horse killed Conrad Roye," the judge lamented.
"Finished his life to take it yourself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"No exhibitions have been made."
However, the legal representative of Carter said that it was “the unfortunate circumstances that he is impatiently suffering”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or age or even mental impairment have no significant impact on her driving".
Sadly, Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, read: “I will not run away in one day so that I will not lose my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sister and we will face the unwarranted pain that we will carry with us forever," continued the declaration.
Roy's sister, Camdy Roy, testified that she's "following" her knowing that she's never a non-participated brother's wedding and will never be his aunt's children.
"The loss of the person I've seen since my birth is the pain that I'm going to bring to life," she said.
The Massachusetts State does not have a law that would set up a person to help kill another person. This case therefore constitutes a legal precedent.
The Carters were 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the seat of a car, equipped with an oxidized oil.
The incident drew attention to the whole nation after the text messages of Carter were published, who committed suicide.
"I need to get out of the building or get out of it," he wrote in the text messages that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on his family leave.
A few minutes before the murder, she wrote to him, "You have to do this to Conrade" and "It's just going to hit the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz indicated that Carter was carefully monitored by Roy's death and ordered that any comments be kept in the press.
The case raised a lot of questions.
One of the people who stood on Carter’s side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing his British residents in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charge was released.
Ms. Knoxova (30) made a statement in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Cartero deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."
The audit will manage up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to the island's take-off
Last day before the announcement, the Audi car manufacturer BMW indicated that he would offer his customers an update of the software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The president of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to the European city - including Minichov, which is the seat of BMW - which consider the ban or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will adjust three million Mercedes vehicles throughout Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a download.
European car manufacturers have promoted a great deal of the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States in order to comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, the oxygen oxide released by diesel engines is considered as carcinogen and can cause asthma.
It also increases the cost of the vehicle to install devices to neutralise gas emissions from diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers are headed for a thorough inspection, Chancellor Angela Merkel's head is accused of discontinuing powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, who in an attempt to comply with emission limits installed in their vehicles software that reduced the amount of emissions issued, but under normal conditions the software was disabled.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were charged in the United States and the others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, Germany would be under arrest for former driving thermodynamics of the engine development department in Audi.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian nation and is therefore not subject to extradition, and can therefore face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of the year, Audi joined the German police in criminal investigation of Volkswagen's car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to carry out European emission limits - and extended the charges that Audi is facing in the USA.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make a relatively small part of the Volkswagen profit.
The plane just got on the beach.
A man and a girl are missing.
An accident occurred on the beach Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC Noticias said that the plane flew quietly over the people on the beach before arrival.
Some people from the beach apparently fled before danger to the sea.
Two people were complaining about running away from the machine.
On the beach, according to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died.
"The plane broke and they were dead," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nation is not known yet.
There were two people on the plane, both of whom were killed, and the police took them to the station.
D11 doesn't seem to set the distance.
And are the distances in Czech completely complete?
I'll thank you.
It's not enough, even though it started to happen in 1978.
Even if it's not available, it's still working.
And it must not continue to be built, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yeah, rough drive D11.
At least for a few months, the next stage of her struggle had just stopped the children of the Earth.
We're getting out of here to get the distance from the bones, like when they're growing up in the sand.
They turn around and they'll see when and if we even get another one.
We don't want any surprises right now.
We just want a short ride and we want to get trucks coming to Poland or from Poland from the village and town.
The endless traffic of trucks goes directly through the city of Jaromér or Nahod, which is not as reasonable as it is.
Only the last success of our stated course has been achieved in 2008, so nine years ago.
From that time on, it's not like that.
So, as soon as the remaining four kilometres of the uncompleted effort to the Kingdom Hall and to the next steps to Jaroméri began with an archaeological investigation that would begin at the end of the year, you could hear the noise of the sponges in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one's ever believed that before.
Last week, it showed that this year will not be created.
And maybe next year.
The Land-Klub Children's Fund for Sustainable Transport from Brna also paid off the bill.
The children of the country repeat their D1 tactics.
Decisions on construction permits have been taken throughout the scope.
They shall request a review of all the obligations already laid down by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the building master, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Office.
So far, with the D11, we're going to eat a little bit of a village with the express name of the Gührbæck.
So we're going down, we're just going along the road, and we're standing on the next train, and we're giving priority to getting to the colony next.
The worst is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
D1 or D8.
Everyone's got their funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth require?
What is the basis for the problems of the communication building in Czech Republic?
And why is the current remote network virtually infinity?

Levandules from Provence threaten climate change
Levandules became a symbol of Provence in the southeastern France, but now they are threatened with climate change.
Levanduly is caused by dry weather and harmful moisture, causing fear to the faces of researchers and pharmacists who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, a professor of agricultural research at CRIEPAPAM in Provence, stated: “Provence is threatened because in recent years this plant has been exposed to climate changes that bring less friction to the fire and the floor.
This affects the life of the elevator.
They also have cicadas and cobalts carrying micro-bacterials to which the dry air comes."
There's a lot in the bag.
Levandule loves tourists and the oil produced from them is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, uncanny and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these solvents is considerably smaller."
The solution can be more effective distribution of water and reduction of water flow from the ground, but also the flow of light sources to the protection of the mixture of iron and water and the removal of several types of waste from the dry weather.
The newspaper’s campaign highlights growing threats in Mexico
The employees of the week of Riodoce regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss news about the disturbances that are taking place in the area of Sinaloa for the involvement of organised criminals, corrupt officials, and non-exceeding drug wars.
Today, however, recent events are largely due to their own safety.
They know it's important to change their habits.
Two qualified journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children to the office where someone attacked the granite in 2009 or leaving her home.
The security experts wrote on the blackboard three simple words: opponents, neutrals and allies.
Journalists ask for names to be given in each word - there is no need for any evidence, enough to use imagination and prediction.
Choose from what - drug dealers, politicians, dealers and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to hide criminal conduct.
Violence does not stop and the body goes up against the whole country; journalists remain among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, they are at least 25 from President Enrique Pena Nita's presence in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states, they have been killed seven years ago.
Among them are the co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence dealing with drug trafficking.
His loss is painful, even though his presence is progressive - a large photograph of Valdez with the letter “Rightness”, which shows the medium, high in the direction of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a trick with Valdez's photo with smile on their face, glasses on their nose and heads.
The meeting takes place about two months after his death; journalists talk about each other’s traumas, nightmares, loneliness, and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to resolve the case of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, two suspects were indicted.
Most of the thousands of murders that come every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will be informed of the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; although the destruction of these lands is still very dangerous.
Without information about the murders and without a view of justice, the meeting on security is unambiguous, says Ibarra.
"It's crazy to spend time with such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we won't trust anyone."
On April 15th, Valdez left the center of Riodoce in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He was able to take several blocks when his red Toyota Corrolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him 12 shots, all because of the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
Then the shooters got into his car and picked it up from the place where it was made.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind him.
It seems that in Culiacan, the news spreads rapidly.
In Valdez's case, however, there's still a suspect silence.
Since the late Guzmán attack and his iron release into the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest wars in the country, as the opposing group tries to fill an empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the tombs are filled with two - story drug dealers for drug kings, many of whom are larger than homes.
Remember for a moment that the word “meaning” means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious links and important routes that travel to the United States of America.
In spite of this, as well as the fact that Valdez was confidently aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director Riodoce is still aware of the fact that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the ultimatum of the conversation with Damasso Lopez, the leader of one of the anti-drug cartels who joined the war with the son of Joaquín Guzmán.
Peace could have divided the sons; the suspects of the gang bought all copies of the news at the time they arrived at the halls.
The second mistake was not to leave Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the fun of other news in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad and was seen as an important champion in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had been able to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that he would never change.
In the Noroest period, he was practically vaccinated when he decided to sell his share at $50 in 2003 and set up with five Riodoce colleagues.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to drive a journalist and not mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually received a good news of stately and fair reports; the news began to spread.
Journalists were pleased to be able to look into the subject of the problem and publish texts without a censorship - the reader fascinated the reading of stories that no one else had ever thought of.
Eight years after the installation, Riodoce won a prestigious evaluation of Maria Moors Cabot for a report on Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Assessment Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his state report on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when he accepted the price.
The traffic with drugs in Sinaloa is “the way of life”, Valdez said in October of last year in a talk for Rompevento TV.
“You must take the role of journalists – or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do face death... why didn't you tell me what's going on?'
The Riodoce employees were after Valdez, a man who was known for his ridicule and non-embracing language. He was a good friend who loved to give advice and objects - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar against the office and sat on the same table.
Now they ask: Did this routine of his death come about?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do your best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you pay for their wives, children, clean shops, secret parking lots."
"These things have been banned," Bojorquez said.
This leads to high levels of self-censorship and self-sustainment.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like he's not playing anything here, his hands are gone.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "which is the meaning of which you can send... and then came to that thing with Javier."
He says old rules, as well as those of others, are no longer paid in Sinaloa - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to the toxic mix of luxury bakeries, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones in the rooms where Riodoce's employees are found; just a few days ago, there was a similar display of spyware that was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Before the building, two police officers found a hole in the wall of a nearby river.
They were elected by the state for the protection of the office of Riodoc, which is located in the four-storey building in the city square of Culiacan.
Journalists are concerned whether these police officers do not belong to those 50 percent of the law defenders who are, according to the statement of the corrupt government.
It's been a few months since journalists have recently moved to the Horne areas, which are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first of these was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Cháveze in Sinaloe.
They are also subject to suspicious government expenditure incurred in the home city of the State governor.
Recently it also came to a few outlaws in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the state representative's office.
Officially, no one was aware of the identity of the unsub or the circumstances of the unsub, so the journalists were warned when they decided to write about what every city's citizens knew: that restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that this restaurant was registered on behalf of a certain policy, which is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), governing all levels of political scene almost all over the past century.
Several of the rulers of PRI were recently accused of corruption on high posts.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident that one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán left the military unit.
More than a month ago, readers would read about this subject in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information about orphans.
"Valdez would certainly have solved the case," said Villarreal (46), who is referred to as "El Flaco" for his rigid position.
"Now all the informers have turned back to us."
Valdez's office was transformed into a cedula warehouse and welcomed protests against the murder of journalists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez fell a few weeks and came out the next morning to demonstrate himself before the State Representative's office because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
The authorities claim that based on DNA analysis, it is Adame.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and shout at the walkers and building "SOS press".
The editor of the newspaper Bojorquez is the day on the visit to Washington, where he seeks international support and attains justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloy, who was executed on the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of following journalists and their killings to make the truth known.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another section of concern that her anger could threaten her innocence.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "confirmed" by organised crime, corrupt officials, and lobbying by the public.
In his last book "Narco-journalism" he wrote that journalists die not only by drug cartels but also by ordering policies and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media surveillance group of Article 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
They're obviously working.
No one remembers the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who arrived six years ago in the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a reference that clearly signed the Charter of Zetas: “This is how I ended up because of my message. ”
According to the broken heads, there was a keyboard and an earpiece.
Some of the parties decided to close their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, with a seat in the northern borders of Chihuahua in response to the immediate murder of the reporter Miroslav Breacho.
The rest continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after his director was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly quoted the drug cartel article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists ran out of their homes or even across the border.
It's an easy decision.
Finding a job in the ransom is difficult, just like getting rid of the feeling that someone's still following you.
And journalists have been persecuted and killed, for example, in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women living in Mexico City, three months after a run from Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and do not give up their jobs, each day presents a serious risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday afternoon and the Riodoce employee is sitting on a walker in front of the office - the latest issue was sent to the press - drinking beer when he starts calling at once.
They learned that 19 people died near the beach resort in Mazatlán, a gang member and police station.
The wave is rising, just as it has promised many links left in this field of trade union.
Journalists publish this news from the mobile phone on the Riodoc websites.
It won't run for one day and the initial title will change again.
The sound of the police sirens indicates another shot.
Bojorquez takes an annual look at police surveillance to make sure they're watching.
If they're scared, they're never giving it up.
Under the huge portrait of the former co-founder of their period - whose mediator is an explicit slogan for the whole Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow his steps.
"How can we just think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when I was killed by Javier the same day, one of the interns asked me to send her to the street?"
The dinosaurs used a camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a drought, no matter how scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first discovery of the amazing creation of the size of the nostril, which the perfectly preserved remains - which experts called the ‘Mona Lisou dinosaurs’ - found a Canadian mountain.
The remains were kept so high that experts were able to determine the red color of his spinal cord and indicated that dinosaurus had “a troubled past”.
The article in Current Biology stated that it is one of the most “responsible findings of the converted dinosaurs and one of the best types of dinosaurs in the world”.
The cactus is a new species of noosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period Crídy, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly maintained attitude has been alarmed by researchers who have described it as a “extraordinary effect. ”
According to National Geographic, the converted whitelist is now the best known of its kind.
It is found that Shawn Funk, who took the stoneline off on 21 March 2011 on his way down to Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberty.
He found something that looked like a strange object and decided to investigate it closer.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have spent the following six years working on animal recovery from the vast coast of the country of 1100 kg.
After completion of work, dinosaurus is prepared for detection.
'It's going to be a little bit tired and you believe it's sleeping,' said the director Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
“It is certainly written into the history of history as one of the most beautiful and most popular types of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
A study of his skin researchers found that this biologist - although he was covered with burning and reminded the walking tank - was likely to pose a serious threat to the mass dinosaurs.
The heavily converted dinosaur used red and white rubber to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
The experts claim that this enabled him to get better acquainted with his environment and avoid his enemies. The masking system indicates that he was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years old dinosaur Nodosauridae was first published in the news in May. Currently available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Boraelopelta markmitchelli, according to the technique of the museum of Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team with a thorough detection of fossil fuels.
Thanks to the remarkable state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document samples and forms of soap and burning throughout the body.
They discovered a masking method that is commonly used today's animals in arms - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part of it.
Although this masculinity effect is natural, researchers are surprised because Borealopelta’s size is far from overemphasized by today’s animals using the same technique.
It is possible, then, that dinosaurus was such a large number of predictors that evolution gave the advantage of masking before confrontation.
Many modern animals with mascots - such as jelen, corn, or pears - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a benefit, which means that noodorus had to fight for his survival.
“The transmission of the vast and heavy dinosaura turned into a visual picture of the dangers posed by the precursors during the class,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds contained in soups also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably redished.
Researchers continue to study animals and look for more knowledge about his life, including the stored contents of the stomach to consume his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was taken to the sea where he fell to the bottom.
In the area of Alberty there was the same climate as in Florida today, and rivers and oceans flowed much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is fully covered in a perfectly preserved preserved leather and at the same time preserved in three dimensions and we can observe its original size,” Brown said.
‘For these reasons, animals seem to be practically the same as in winter.
You don't have to use your imagination for his reconstruction; it's enough to calm your eyes and seem like he's just asleep.'
During the winters, there were large numbers of terrorists, massive dinosaurs that moved on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyranosaurus rex - lived for millions of years after Borealopelta, this twisted dinosaur could be the favorite of his equally terrible ancestors.
They belong to Acrocanthosaurus, 11,5 metres long monster with a weight of more than 6 tons.
Researchers whose most recent findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that Boraelopelta's body was drowned into the sea after it was mumified in the pool.
It is found that Shawn Funk, who withdrew the stoneline on 21 March 2011 on his way to the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberty.
According to the museum, it is the best dinosaur ever discovered in the world, including skin and skin, which is more complete than a shoe.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two 50 cm left.
The researchers believe that this biologist has crossed the territory of Canada today until he has completed the river that flowed him into the sea.
His underground grave kept his body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this type are also kept in order to ensure that the charged payments around the leukemia continue to cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “finding such a learned unit can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking my finding is.
Fossil residues of this type are also kept in order to ensure that the charged payments around the leukemia continue to cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers guideing upwards.
I can barely count the shoes on his walk.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrello grew up throughout the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, St. Louis and his family moved to a bed in Airbnb's room and made contributions to Facebook on their phone.
She's found it in the contribution of some high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," he continued.
She was surprised that no one else had signed this contribution, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoh has always retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy who shot a white cop in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's body, which lies uncontrollably on the street from where no one took it in four hours.
"It's crazy," thought Ferrel.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left the phone to come back to him tonight when she was watching tweets about people gathered at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed that the father was a victim and held a chair with the letter "The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She followed the live news - one of the police stood before a group of protestors, holding in the hands of a guide and at the end of the shooting dog.
In another video, another policeman, as she pointed out, held the gun, which he pointed to at the tax, and said: “I will kill you all... animals. ”
"It's not normal," said Ferrel.
"This is not the kind of murder we used to and we can call it normal.
I felt the skin's ugly all over the body.
"I was devastated and cried."
Right away, she spoke back and she left home the other day.
Upon arrival at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter away from her father and decided that they'd leave to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrello and the city of Ferguson during the next three years describes the new document “Whose Streets?”, which will be introduced to the cinema on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and reconciliation, the strength and indivisibility of people living in the community who go to the streets and ask for answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell's dialogue with his daughter - dressed in flower dress and the same flower dress - on the subject that they had discussed many times before - "of experience with blacks".
"Remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalls the conversation.
"At the same time, we're going to Ferguson because the police killed 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"It didn't seem to matter that I wouldn't take it with me," said Ferrel later.
"Today's events are a surprise... to which they came in the past.
She had to know it and see it in her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activation and organisation, but also had to know the difference between different kinds of experience with black people and what we need to do in order to be freed.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which racism does not exist in her own skin, there is no way out of the other Black Child.
I feel that if I protected her before this experience, I would only hurt her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florsant Road against the police department, which became the basis for activists who were expecting police officers Darren Wilson's words about his accidental involvement in the incident.
There Ferrell met his daughter with a local businessman who was preparing for the rest of the meal.
They prepared food in the bags and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrel, he slowly began to give birth to a new type of activism.
“My activism turned to the top of my feet after 9 August,” Ferrel explained and added that during a high school study at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and was concerned about the introduction of health care and nutrition in the Black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrello met with a later co-author, Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucaro-Farr wanted to "document" what was happening.
Ferrello, however, wondered: ‘ Are you working on the document or trying to find a story that would be useful?
Such scepticism has spread to the community through many people, often white people who wanted to cause pain and resolve.
Folaana explained in her recent speech: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often forgotten and we wanted to change them. ”
Folayan has already joined with co-founder Damon Davis, who is known as a local artist who is involved in prison all over the world.
His participation in the project was also sponsored by Ferrello and with six other local residents who were watching the "Whose Streets" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"In this document no one speaks for us, but it is our report," said Davis.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrello's experiences - in an attempt to show that the strike "is not about the rescue leader, but about the approach of the community," Folayan said - it was shown that she was just the most open to participation in filming.
The document “Whose Streets” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrel’s life, for example, as she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like wet," said Ferrel with a smile on his face when she thought about the first time she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order to do this work and to clean up the blacks, I have to open up."
The experience of Ferrello also highlights the role of middle black women in the broader aspect of the Black Live Matter.
Two of the three hackers - who responded to the murder of teenagers Trayvona Martina in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMutter - call themselves subversives.
"Black middle women in leading positions in the final outcome stand for the maintenance of the strike," Ferrel said, "because we are still fighting more and more fronts.
Black middle women must endure the silence of these events."
Folano agrees with this statement and adds that “the strike is actually supported by black women and a large number of middle black women."
However, it insists that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrel is not a main source of evidence for his views.
"It was just that she was a source of strength and energy," she said.
“that it has just happened in the previous lines is no accident, because life on these cross-sections in the skin of a black sub-divine woman is dangerous.
You feel that energy pressure even before the screen."
In the meantime, back in Ferguson, the TV stations destroyed their position, but the heavy racial tensions between the community and the police continue.
Ferrello recovers two and a half years of condition to block the distance from the demonstration.
The social political atmosphere in the area that she calls home described as "the mess."
Still, it does not stop in its effort to make a commitment from the moment she was born three years ago to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love each other and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
On Colinska's hot field.
There were dozens of hunters on the spot, and he also helped the gardener.
Shortly after the Czech ship in Colinska, between the towns of Bylan and Liblica, it burned from 14:00 a field of 15 hectares of dispersion.
Fire was spread around 15:15, and the officers declared the third degree of fire burning out of four possible ones.
According to the speaker, Ladislav Holomčíka helped fire out of the air and fire out of the tank.
At 18:00, the fire was lit by fire, the fire caused damage to the 700,000 crowns.
There were dozens of professionals and volunteers fighting with the flames on the ground.
The fire caused a technical disturbance in the engine compartment.
Hasit also helped the gardener who carried out six glass of water.
"We gave the owners a place of refuge until the next 8:00 will be watched by a unit of volunteers," said Holomčík today.
And Becoming Resemblance: artificially creating portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery is now located several faces of various sections of the coat - white, black and snow - covered from the ceiling on the streets. Each of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the posters from the mouth of the wall and hair that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning's samples were sent from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where his former analyst reopens a 35-year sentence for the unauthorized release of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, information and art, and Manning's, transsexual and promiscuous dissident, whose punishment reduced Obama three days before leaving his post as president of the United States.
Algoristic DNA analysis of Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would appear to have created Dewey-Hagborg's bridge, unless an intellectual comment on DNA submissions - as well as many ways that DNA can interpret - and the inexplicable determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since her youth. It was judged in 2013 on the basis of twenty complaints, including six infringements of Spanish laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were kept by prison staff. On the public she was only one black photo in a lower quality, on which Manning, apparently concerned, is sitting on the seat of the driver in a platinum blonde pair that is now connected.
In 2015 there were still positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
Under this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various Forensic objects - such as non-computer cigarettes and candles - to create images of possible forms of these people.
And right now she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"Chistali interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add the article to the portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained when it was possible to open a new exhibition.
However, visitors and photographers were not allowed to contact Chelsea with the question of whether she should be interested in the DNA portrait.
The art and its enchanted museum have been scanning for two years through correspondence.
They even created comics called Supressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was abused and could attend the exhibition personally.
President Obama actually requested a few days after the commission was issued to release Manning, which has been a welcome change in the military prison in Kansas for several years.
It is interesting that the exhibition takes place at the same time as Donald Trump carries out a war with people who seek to publish information from government and trans- heretic soldiers while trying to find new ways to do so in the areas where they should support their tweets.
In response to the question of this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "all is happening for some reason".
According to an art release on one of the gallery walls, Manning's famous signature (the letter “i” in the title is derived from the heart) after the end of “the unique fractionation based on sex, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the other hand, the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA are found - a stanza of letters C, G and A with recorded difficulty.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of art) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how amazingly similar, at least on the biological page, we are all.
"I hope that people will be able to do this that our genes do not depend on who we are and that genetic data are subjective and can be put out by everyone," said Dewey-Hagborg. Her work is also seen by Spurious Memories in 2007 on the theme of the video.
"DNA will tell a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a private room, is the only page from the above graphic news.
It shows Manning, who boasts in the way of King Kong from the United States Discipline Baracks prison with megaphone in his hand.
“As long as they prevent you from appearing, they win,” she writes.
"Never hide yourself."
"It's a direct copy of one of the letters," said the Philadelphian artist.
"When I think about it, my skin's scarred."
Manning's exhibition has not personally witnessed - which has been announced in a comic book - but when this happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genome photos, listed as a Protestant tax.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including about 160 cm high Manings Sox, for which its genetic haploscopies are marked with difficulty.
"In the past they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted to feel the tax," said Dewey-Hagborg about the portraits.
"I wanted to point out the concept of mass movement that takes Chelsea's image and frees her."
Professor of North West University and employee of Oxford University sought for murder
In those days, a national patrol was conducted by the professor of North West University and the staff of Oxford University, who were arrested for suspecting the murder of a man who was found dead in a luxury fishing apartment, reported to the police.
On Monday, a first-class shooter was released on behalf of Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, says the Cook County trial.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several minor injuries.
The Chicago Police reported that the body of the deceased was found on 27 July.
The police were warned about this fact by telephone. After arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market branches.
Cornell-Duranleau was reported to be on the scene for the murder and detectives investigating the case as murder.
Lathem has been working on the position of a hundred microbiology and immunology of the North Western universities since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president of public relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now administratively authorized and has been banned from accessing university schools.
"The entire business is now being examined by the relevant authorities and the North-West University fully cooperates with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
The language university and Somerville College stated in a statement by an e-mail: "We were contacted by the British police and we were also prepared to assist the American police."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked and eager to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, a leading contact with the public of the Chicago Police Department, indicated that he was calling for suspects to appear to the relevant authorities.
"Police has information about their place of residence and the effort to suppress suspects is growing," Guglielmi said.
Guglielme added that the police are helping local, regional and national authorities in the pursuit of suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the building manager Grand Plaza, who was warned of the incident to arrive in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it's not clear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The Director of the Grand Plaza issued a statement for all residents: "Police is now working on setting up the victim's time review and profile and investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"We'll finish the WADA plan in the near future" - Russian Prime Minister Mutko
The Vice-President of the Russian Government, Vitaly Mutko, stated that it will not last long and will come to the implementation of the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At the present time, part of the new plan criteria have been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko introduced on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA's code-recording plan - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which has recently been published on the website of the organizations.
According to the Mutka Codex, there is nothing that Russia should worry about.
“All has been notified and all will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the above criteria is called after a public announcement of the results of the WADA survey conducted by Richard McLaren, on the detailed sponsorship of Russian athletes from the government.
Mutko said on this subject: “We know the investigation, since our antidoping system was obviously down.
It was adapted to all measures.
However, there were no state programmes in our country, and we can therefore not accept anything that had never existed."
Mutkov's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In the discussion for Russian RSport Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping factors, but he added: “In many cases, we have indicated that the report contains a controversial situation and regulation.
No one plans to accept the message entirely without prejudice," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed the planning and integration of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Dumping Agency (UKAD) in June.
After a visit to the Moscow centre of the organisation in July, General Director-General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSSADA is "on the right path" for resuspending.
The police accused three people, one of them young.
The police accused three men of setting fire on the middle of the ordinary wooden church in Trinci-Guutech on Fridecko-City.
One accused is young, all three are Czech people.
They are threatened by a criminal act of general threat to them by 15 years of imprisonment.
Journalists today have been told this by Morazkoslesk police officer Tomáš Kužel.
He said it was a deliberate criminal act.
"It's very clean business and the police are currently working on the whole business," Kužel said.
He indicated that the police would deal with the possible arrest of the accused.
Further information may not be published by the Director.
"I can't communicate anymore because the work is actually being done by the police and the investigation and the state representative who monitors the matter," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came into existence in the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and pictures from the first half of the 16th century.
Weight damage is estimated to be ten million kroner, but historical loss is uncountable.
After the fire, interest began to be considered as a reconnaissance of the church.
Most of the costs should cover insurance, other costs are prepared to share with the Ministry of Culture and the City, the public collection is also prepared and the memory owner's contribution is calculated, and local heritage is available.
A similar wooden church of Saint Catherine from the 16th century in Ostravi-Hrab also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
That's what led to the launch of an electronic installation.
And then there was a direct copy in his place.
State counts with citizens in the defence of the state.
They're supporting their training.
With financial support for State-owned troops, voluntary shooting training or training training teams, the law on the preparation of citizens for the defence of the State shall be considered as essential.
The Ministry of Defence, which has received its work from the government, promises to increase the physical competence of Czechs and their capabilities which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law had been adopted in the future, the state would have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in support of the defence.
The basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system, which would help to enhance the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the state, in addition to the performance of defence duties and on the basis of volunteers.
For example, the State would financially or materially support the associations of radiomaters, shooters or cynologists and would allow their members to increase their capacity.
The payment would provide information on people who are willing to come to the country in times of crisis and their abilities or material equipment.
Accreditation could also be provided by instructors who would help couples and other stakeholders in training or training.
It is also included in the organisation of words with war veterans or people who lived in huddinsk.
One of the possible options suggests that a new office should be established, which should be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state should use their capabilities until the threat status has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the progressive alignment of apparent boundaries between individual types of threat," states a reference to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
The Ministers noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on support for the largest number of capabilities, not just those of the military.
"The basic objective of the objective is to create a very broad framework that enables every citizen to respond adequately to the situation threatening the superiority of the state or life, health and property of persons, to protect himself, to contribute to the protection of others, and to avoid undue misconduct by the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the plan states.
The adoption of the law would result in a lack of financial guarantees.
Their height will depend on the chosen option, according to the Ministry.
For example, the Authority proposes financial support for projects for the preparation of citizens for the defence of the state up to 100 million kroner.
If an administrative and coordination centre was set up, its operation could be around 60 million kroner per year.
Other money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also suggests that the capacity of national military leaders should be extended, which would jointly employ 42 other soldiers.
The representatives of the ministries have already indicated that the law should also help to resolve the conflict of certain Czech policies with the introduction of the European Union arms control directive.
It would allow firemen who would be part of the system to leave some of the weapons prescribed by the directive.
The startups that your company will help you get rid of another Uber
Amy Erretts wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of his e-commerce, but she did not find the appropriate research.
The answers were often vague, ineffective, or even complaining.
And although she promised anonymity of the study, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
"I was looking for continuity and objectivity," said Errettov, owner of the company's e-commerce of Madison Reed hairdresser with a seat in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help outside.
New start-ups from the human resources sector continue to appear on the market, helping companies to investigate the welfare of employees.
The establishment and licensing of the software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' obligations enable start-ups to carry out a rapid vote, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers a simple anonymity of employees and a hot line for difficulty, and in some cases it also allows informers to include in-house and contact the Director directly.
"There are tools on the market such as Strava and Fitbit, which follow your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and general director of the Glint startup in Reedwood City.
Errettov said that thanks to Glinto, she had received more information in three years about what her employees think and how they feel.
In addition to the rapid research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and a regular review of groups with the highest number of problems, as well as a review of low-assessment managers - which allows users to work on repairs.
The companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to focus on the culture of the working environment - for the case that another Uber would become involved in the scandals after an ex-employer posted a contribution to his blog describing the company environment and the burden of employees who are reluctant to speak openly.
For start-ups such as Glint, the demand for business culture is a luxury business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance by 2020 can exceed $118.8 billion.
The Start-Convertent in the state of Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, looked forward to a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, firmly before the Uber scandal.
About 600 Converter customers include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently accepted Uber under his wing as well.
Like Glint, Konvertent allows the company to send appropriate “light” research, collect reliable information in real time and visualize the heat maps of the problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous hot line of text that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the disease is sent directly to the board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has strengthened regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and executive director of the Convercent startup.
If the company is certified by wrong conduct with its employees or non-ethical conduct - and if the regulators do not delay - it may result in costly consequences due to the struggle of customers, employees or court proceedings, Quinlan may add.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant, which employs more than 25,000 people in 500 locations, uses the Convercent for more than a year to increase employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure a easy way to contact corporate leadership.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check his phone number or e-mail on the company’s management, officially give trouble and trust in a sound solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who did not previously have a reliable way to monitor the health of employees.
Now, when the company uses the Convercent, there is a rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been achieved before to managers, officers, on miles away from the real solution of the problem, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair behaviour.
"It is close to the Holistic, a comprehensive look at the experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday companies looking at risk management.
"At the same time, we protect the shareholders from court disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking ethics, values and participation of employees in light weight in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting company collapsed after the fall of Enron’s company in the abuse of ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But even when “you have brought social media all over, ” companies began to realize that online they can’t simply hide their nightmares in the closet.
"Before people started using technology ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of services for which companies pay regular payments.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is accepted by the prudent investors who supported both startups.
Konvertent chose in the framework of his company's campaign for the company as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital totalling $10 million and finally brought the capital up to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are complex in view of the relationship between society, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research confirms clearly that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And on the competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, are not the main benefits of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to consider that they are accepted and evaluated and that they owe their time to a company that enforces a positive message.
"If people are happy at their work, they think their voice is heard and their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, vice-president of global benefits and employee benefits of LinkedIn, who uses the Convercent i Glint.
Investors make up, if they do, companies and companies prosper, if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when an analytical tool is found on the market, which will ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to society, it is not surprising that there will be a number of investors supporting this effort.
It is important for experts in working culture to provide data on employees' satisfaction.
But the data alone are inaccurate, if the company does not take the necessary steps.
In fact, the fact is that whenever a company asks for a return from its employees, it can make a big difference.
And if the change does not take place quickly - in the worst case - it may result in a downturn and a lack of interest in employees.
"When you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, head of the consulting company Kotter International, who was witnesses to many companies who were too dependent on their own data.
"Because as soon as you can't reach the end, the employees will start asking themselves, 'Did they ever hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it interest me?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey between employees, is able to solve the problem one day with Glint.
Following the gathering of feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision and the quality of communication, Errettov was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start learning communication to solve the problem effectively.
Ruby Tuesday receives a very important view of its employees and hopes that from a long-term perspective, it will achieve high employment in the field, which is known to be a common escape.
"If you do not insist on creating a transparent working environment, employees will not trust you," Vitrano added.
“And when you start losing your employees, you will become customers.
And with the benefit of customers, the whole company is cut off."
Thursday became the hottest day.
On Thursday, with 38.3 degrees of attendance in the Watch Tower at Hodoninsk, it is now the most recent day of the year in Czechia.
So he crossed the line that was originally the most visited day of the year from 37.3 degrees.
They informed the staff of the Czech hydrometeological institution.
On the other hand, Tuesday afternoon, but there were not many heat records.
The weather was mainly in Moravia, and in Czechia it was extremely dressy.
A record of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations over 30 years of age was reviewed on Tuesday.
On Thursday the record was only nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps today's temperature was the same as the previous record in The Watchtower in 2013.
In January in Brussels today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum of four decades and in the Pohorelica in the present 37.1 degrees exceeded the record of three decades.
Both records have been published in the same way as in The Watchtower since 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, there was the largest audience in Dyjákvicí on Znojemsk and the ship over Dyjja on Břeclavka, where the Friday was held at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not end.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Czech countries, according to the CHHMU website, today’s highest temperature is only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures began to grow there until late afternoon," said meteorologists.
The current trend in Czech society will be gradually rescinded according to the CHAMU and will be able to reach even greater levels on Sundays.
Most parts of Moravia, but high temperatures will remain on Friday and on the south side of Moravia and on Saturday.
We've had this kind of trouble here.
billionaires don't have the same voice in the voices as every full person on earth.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are as tight as Andrej Babish, who wants to own state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other water colleagues Martin Burdou and Antony Friche, sponsors Robeško Realist.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of insurance and business in real Paul Sehnal, who is also the president.
The convicted corrupter and the king of the Czech hazard, Ivo Valenta, have organized the Party of Personals.
Agrofert's political campaign, as the project Andreje Babiše did not want to name the Romanian elder Jaroslav Germany, is a capital for himself.
They've recently caught their billionaires, too.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, owner of the jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he goes into politics in order to rule well.
The entry in the old-fashioned dress didn't tell her much.
"I've never had any small goals," he said at the press conference.
This means that my goal is to push the ANO to win the old man's vote by twenty percent.
Leckdo's in a hurry.
But it's more characteristic of the grandpa's rebirth.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although she's willing to vote for the voters in the Oldest's dress, she continues to support Andrey Babies.
Grandfather also supported the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a shot-in-the-word and uncontrollable rival of political parties," he wrote prior to the 2013 elections.
But he's definitely not going to politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babi's gonna stay with me.
He's willing to get out of his control world and do something for us all.
Not long after her old-fashioned new violence, she confessed to her surprise to Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Old People to learn how to cooperate with Babish.
Some can appreciate that Grandpa doesn't change his mind and stand behind him regardless of what dress he wears.
Others can speculate if you send Babi to the elders to build up your boyfriend to someone who's so unmotored.
Further questions can be asked whether Chief Jablotron should have been involved with Chief Agrofert in the business and not looking for another way to defend his commercial rival.
The first grandpa's public appearance, but not just around Babies.
Grandpa promised to send the old men to campaign ten million.
And if they need more money first, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop over a similar cause.
Last legally recognized guannik Bakala before the elections in 2010 spread millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agencies Viita Barty, TOP 09 and the population of democracies came together in this way to a total of thirty million.
It's just another time today.
The law prohibits any political party to give more than three million.
When Grandpa's in politics, at least he could learn the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't be asking a question why our politics has such a bad story.
Then, on his first day in politics, Grandpa symbolized the proposal for tax relief to the family with the children who were studying.
People with high school education will come to us every month for a total of tens of thousands.
You're based on a few dozen.
A man with tens of thousands is now rich.
He's 20 poor.
In Grandpa’s view, the company pays taxes fairly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the social state, where they do not share too much.
The rich are short-lived in need of help so that they don't die of necessity.
Old-fashioned people can grab each other's hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandmother, can confirm that billions of people are not good people.
Then there's still a question of who to love.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who are members of their own country or citizens and nationals of the State do not have their own employees and land for their own property.
And in the end, those who want to live well in a rich land are not just people.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced to 234 million.
Selling property is never easy.
And sometimes he can't even help 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that property sells President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down for an incredible 8 million pounds.
He informed about the Mirror.co.uk website.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Stay away from the place like no other.
Nor did the association of real society with the US President bring about an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean silk with an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price was 13 million pounds.
And after that, the villa complex is about 76 medium-sized apartments in the centre of Prague.
And it's not funny.
The catchment seat of 5 acres [5 acre] on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 fully-qualified bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, lots of food, violence and other rooms.
It's made up of several buildings.
The part of the land is also a pool and tennis court.
Ten of them are burned on the ground.
From the terrace is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real experts, the fact that the association with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers has been demonstrated at the price.
Now property is closer to the usual prices of property on the island.
The storm purchased property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
He had to buy property for the purpose of rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
It's a new price, but it's heading to second place.
The property in the neighborhood was estimated at 13.5 million pounds.
The NCAA decided to end with two trains a day.
Nearly eleven afternoons and players of UCLA's UCLA's UCLA's football match is at the back of the new school resort.
Some of them strip off their clothes and expose their shameful background, a cold sign of the first day of the training campaign.
For most of the members of these teams, a few minutes of breakfast take place in the afternoon.
Players will go to the rooms after a three-hour training course to study on final exams before they return to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place this morning at 6:30 p.m.
"For these guys, the next three days will be a regular cat," said coach Bruins Jim Mora shortly before lunch was over in the afternoon.
By organizing two coaches in one day NCAA wants to ease players - paradoxically the training days are even longer - at least when the final test ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainers are planned at 19:15 - to get so busy with so many students' diaries.
For the first six season that Mora spent on the trainer's position in Westwood, the training camp Bruins starts a week earlier than last year and trainers are limited during the summer season. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainees from two to one day.
A total of eight trainers are scheduled to begin formal preparations for the first race against the Texas A&M team, which runs in September.
He must be allowed to hear that he supports the NCAA decision, even though it has added another post to an already busy player's diary.
"For three or four days, players are under great stress and it is very frustrating for them," said Mora.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will be quiet."
UCLA will be closed after the completion of the training campaign, which will not be easy to look at the clear line of surrounding lands from the nearby park and luxury hotel Luski Center, which has equipped players with a secure network for the branch.
Players Bruins should want to get pregnant start this week, but Mora realizes that when the room is empty during the season, it could be a problem.
"The ground will be a security service," added Mora.
"The security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can find a room and store our trains.
It's a good deal with this stuff.
The hotel will be happy to watch protection, as well as parking lot no. 8.
We're using our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything's gonna be okay.
It's all planned."
Facebook is planning a more thorough control of the facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under original contributions in an effort to fight against the so-called "fake news", the largest social network on Thursday.
In a statement on its websites, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible Hoaxes, which will send third parties to the verification and potentially visualize the results of the study under the original contributions.
Facebook has been designated as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is taking place. French voters are flooded with false reports of flower presidential elections, and Germany plans to launch an account on the social media network as soon as they do not remove any angry contributions.
On Thursday, in his next statement published in Germany, Facebook indicated that the launch of the testing of new features of the control of false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to viewing reports from third parties, people ask more content to be better informed and can decide what they can share," said Sara Su, the product manager of Facebook.
He added that Facebook is continuing to test the function of "relevant articles" and is also working on other changes with a view to reducing the number of false messages.
Graphical news: story about A Castle in England
The small mountain Scotney Castle recently played its main role in the music video clip of the team of Squeez and also found its exhibition in Margaret Thatcher during the 70th and 80th centuries.
However, Scotney was a 700-year-old Witness of the Bewl River in the British Kent, inspired by the curvature of Jamie Rhodes from the York City - a famous interest in historical documents - to create graphic novels.
"Look at the letter of a man who is 300 years after death fascinated me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I keep a letter in my hand, I feel personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents family life that lived in the city of Scotney from the middle of the Middle Ages to the Eduardev period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not the first book of Rhodes inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"He invited me to print my fingers on letters that he wrote to a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jacobity," he said.
"It's the print of his finger!
And the letters always smell like smoke because in those days you had to burn a candle to read.
If I'm going to write a letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support is from the National Trust and Arts Council England organization and the possibility to spend almost four months on the wall almost like a dream. ( "To tell the truth, I have to stay a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time studying the Victorian “new” city, studying the archives and studying many treasures and curiots, such as the head of hyenas on the walls and branches that were planted after the fall in the cave.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old city, talked to the hyenas, gardeners, and sometimes also to artists who worked on illustrations in his book.
In the night, he was "drinking whiskey and writing."
A reliable Scotney story is relatively unknown, since the National Trust organization had access to documents until 2006 after the death of its last grandfather, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the place ten years later, the employees began to dig up the archives that Rhodes described as “the aristocracy of many centuries spread the hands of the words ‘You know this to cover’.
The Danish, letters from the British Empire, the striking map of the estate: "You may think the dispute about the land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I found a case when two families were overcrowded.
Leave it to people!"
Some stories in the book use the hill as a reflection museum and dream of deeper into English history, including the story called The Laborer, which follows men who leave the newly built hill to join the English rebellion in 1381.
"I found a record of opposition to the town from 1380, which was in the book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
“In fact, the English rebellion started in this area, and I thought that support was a good starting point.
Maybe it's something to do with the end."
The other stories are certainly in line with the history of the city - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest who hid Darrell’s family after seven years during the English reform.
Or The Smuggler about the 18th century Passover, named Arthur Darrell, who apparently designed his own funeral when he filled out the rock rocket (which appeared several years after the discovery of the cancer).
Rodes ’ beloved family are Darrells: “I was attracted by the men’s kisses - men who were always charged and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of Darrell's families have solved this by reading rich or old ladies - I imagine they were the kind of gentlemen who had their heads dressed with their heads. "
With the end of the stay in the town of Pedro Rhodes after other holidays.
He recently returned from a two-week stay in a Finnish divorcée, where he built inspiration for his next book on Eljemäki, an ancient sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was captured by nature.
For Scottney, however, it's a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said, 'Now I'm going back to real life.'
Washington changes conditions for making green cards
The media published the words of President Donald Trumpa on a new US immigration plan, which will also change when the green card is made.
It is expected that the number of legal immigrants will be reduced by 50,000 each year as a result of stricter rules for the provision of temporary labour visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The legislative proposal will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases debt and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we aim to change the rules for the issue of green card to citizens of other countries.
The law limits the number of passengers and rewards the current scheme.
The new application process is a primary English-speaking applicant, who expresses the financial resources and evidence of the abilities that will come with the benefit of our country," said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual jobs are on the rise - we should be on the watch
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more interesting, a report on the technological development of sexual robots appears on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual jobs are currently very popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and art intelligence at Sheffield University, and co-founder FRR Noela Sharkey, it is necessary to take a serious look at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the beard and the view of the absence of the robot.
"People get involved with them, but sales are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them more often," Sharkey said, on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sexual assistance changes from you to a robotic woman to a silicone skin that is on the touch of pleasant heat - of course is an art of intelligence that likes human behavior.
The user can "set" the robot to the image - from the color of the eyes and shape of the needle to the color of the eyes and the color of the teeth.
It is also a very disturbing fact that many robots have their own "pity" that would attract the Stepford lady.
Modern smokers grew up in a robotic woman with a silicone skin.
The owner of RealBotix's job can set up a variety of character drawings, including shame.
And then here's a sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Company, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah", which is marked by a shy behavior and "Wandy" with a "good society".
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set up to the maximum extent possible to reflect your personality," writes the True Company website.
So he likes what you like and he likes.
It's even cool, just like people.
It can be tired, chatting, or "in trouble".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming now for a few reasons - between which there is no substitute for real mesilid relationships. The most worrying female characters and violent assaults - e.g. Fregid (a number of exciting) Farrah.
The True Company on its websites compares Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a husband have Roxxxy?" he writes on the page.
However, sexual jobs are not just fetish or sexual help.
Their appearance and almost perfect sophistication indicate something darker and deep in our culture - a derogation from ideal or sexual equality by the direction of sex after sex with a volleyball.
Most men don't buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing love, sexual workers remain on the edge of a wide public interest.
However, this genuine interest can be a reflection of modern times.
And most people are not subversive or violent until they are deprived of a free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sexual jobs appear at a time when women around the world are exercising their rights, and in the White House, the president is sitting at the woman’s address, sometimes expressing himself very aggressively.
The most frightening aspect of the series of experiences is not what we see - the body and the eyes spread as the reality of these visions.
The book’s presentation of experience is a step in the right direction, but at the same time it seems to be a small step.
Sexual jobs are available as much as possible to real women as possible (needs with porn rates).
Their shapes are designed to be pleasing to the touch and able to look first as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "humanity", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would undermine their independence or breach their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice kids.
He says 21st century: official.
The NBA star on the green watch.
Curry's fighting in California about a cat.
The star basketballist Stephen Curry did not lose in spite of the first set off at the beginning of the premier between professional golfers.
Double rating holder for the most profitable NBA player played on the tournament Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round on 74 ran and will fight about the cut.
Player Golden State, who received the second title in NBA with the Warriors team in this season, began very nervously and his first vacation ended in a hold on a golf course in a railway park.
Even after that, he wasn't as precise as under the basketball suit, although he left ten professionals with a four-year balance over a couple.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, you have to call the decision-makers right after the first break, but then it's a little sit-down," said Curry with the fall of a huge tree on him.
It was very nervous, to blow the first morning on the tournament, but it was all I had hoped for.
"If you told me I was playing 74 in the first wheel, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Currym is able to fight with a knife that will most likely be set at two wounds under pairs, he will become the first representative of another sport to be able to do this on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've been out of the woods, that's probably going to happen," said the top golfer, who in the past played on tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
In Hayward, he starts first on the tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he got a sponsor's exception and kept an amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under elite PGA Tour.
Tromp's big victory?
In contrast, Mitt Romney is a healthy mind-encompassing.
A poor sign of the Trompo era is becoming political dividends that divide the American volleyballs, and in a micro-measurably disrupt the entire family.
In Vánoc and Thank you, in American newspapers, this has been denied by the Council, how to deal with the friendly people who love Trump.
I bet we're just waiting for the nerves.
However, less attention has been paid to the family's ability to mold.
I'm talking about the fact that this week she visited me in New York my sister - a nurse and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has paid for the Republican crime in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that the connection between the face and the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with the Trupe in the White House, the entire family - including all the Republican neighbors with whom she had been interested in politics for years - is in one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm worried that in a wider context, this represents a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has a great impact on all of us transport.
If we are talking about "normalization" and the Trumps, we are referring to a frightening possibility that one day his scars can lose their attractiveness.
There is, however, a more serious long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the legitimate Republicans who, in accordance with its standards, will be alarmed by what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitta Romney and his version of the crazy conversation - dog on the roof of the car, 14% of the tax (at least we had news of his tax admission) - both of which appear to be a very peaceful outcome compared to the Trump.
After Trupa's departure, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an unwarranted improvement.
We used my sister's visits and took the children to Central Park on the largest circle that runs the New York Park department - you will find no better use for your three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle war is covered with slolaminates - clowns and animals are involved and in the horror they look at their own shoulder - a whole humble view and the cinca music of the shopping cart is a reminder of public transport.
A lot of circles are moving fast: view of the high buildings, panorama is watching, instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
About five years later, I still did not understand the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Switzerland's cheese - not counting thematic Mr. Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the station of the Metro in London.
In the Central Park, however, it is a highly magical experience, and to the point that two two-year-olds, as well as two-year-old women, will enjoy it.
If I could count the circle, I'd deserve a maximum of points, but no one's asking for luck.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to assess my "study" at a level from one to five at the time of payment of the credit card.
In the coffee shop on my street, it's the same thing, with the difference that I can come up with a 15% discount for something I'm buying at the desk.
Not only is this slowing down another fast sale, but the server is forced to turn into a buyer's shop if it's not necessary.
The woman at the store apologized to me with a smile when I appreciated my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is already the area where Pistorius must be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for a number of injuries to the arrest, which, according to the statement of the prison itself, resulted in a fall in total.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original sentence for murder.
He killed his friend Steinkamp in the early morning hours in Valentín in 2013 with several shots through the door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he was online stealing her.
The complainants announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the Six-year penalty of Pistorius, which is too peaceful according to their words.
The National Procedural Authority has indicated that it is referred to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the Court of Justice is still in effect this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with a penalty extension of up to 15 years.
In the Republic of South Africa there is no death penalty.
For the first time in history, a young man was born in the embrace of a respected panda, who was caught in a wildfire.
It's a huge success for the Pand rescue program.
The center is still trying to expand the genofound of the pandas held in custody.
Čang Č-chung told the agency of New China that driving a panda poses a great risk of flying from a neighboring cross.
Only 471 pounds were spent at the end of the last year.
Only two thousand live in the free environment.
He's trying to keep the pancakes busy with these weird ones is the first step to get the pand to help protect this kind of guy.
The Cchao-cchao Patnocile was released to the natural reserve at the beginning of the summer period of 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on the wall, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
She met her favorite Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
A couple of minutes and a half and he got successful.
And this can be considered a small surprise because the monkeys themselves are not the view of the most successful hunters of animals.
Sams are quite wrong when they're ready, and they're often confused and confused about what to do.
The young was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinarily high appetite, it weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn pandy is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on 1st August in the mornings by the Sidonian police.
All were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated to BTV that Bulgarian tourists were released later.
The Greek authorities have ratified the rules of free camping and have imposed strict sanctions on anyone who is admitted to a place where the camping is not permitted.
Checks will take over the whole season.
The Ministry indicated that the court could arrest him.

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are making millions of toxic eggs out of the market.
The Netherlands alone was temporarily closed by 180 refugees due to the incident.
According to the Reuters agency, the Dutch Food Safety Authority announced that it investigates 20 per cent of all Dutch farmers, which means that 80 per cent of eggs on the market are not required.
The Authority has stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of species recognised by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the number of toxic substances in small eggs and for adult hazards does not represent, however, the potential risk is for children.
The Czech SVS Petr Major reported that the eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined in the closure of the cows, did not arrive in Czech lately.
However, the veterinary samples of eggs and chicken are collected from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where problems of insecticide have occurred.
Belgium’s eggs were last on the Czech market in depth and eggs last in May, according to the veterinary administration.
The hot flesh from Belgium last appeared in Czech in June.
In Czech, however, there is a certain quantity of chicken meat from the Netherlands.

Riga's beautiful, I'm going to miss her, she's gonna say a loud sedláček and she's looking for an appointment.
I'd like to have ten more years.
"I need to go back there once," said 27-year-old Sedlček, who could start the season in a bad dress.
It depends on whether he gets involved at the beginning of the new anniversary.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to value it as in school, I'd say three.
I didn't get much in the first year, I had an experienced speaker before me.
I learned.
The second year, I started to get caught.
Last season, I thought they were giving me more space.
But they brought a new gentleman with whom I had a fight again.
Lony, I thought I'd get caught.
But during the initial ten games, we got only about five points, so the coachers started to beat up.
He's got more of my colleague at the end.
But that's what he does.
They wanted to play him for the next season.
What was life like in Riz?
That's great.
It's little Praha.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found a friend there.
We're together for the third year, next year we'll get married.
So I brought something.
How is KHL useful for the bankers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Sloven who have to change their hierarchical style against him.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to pay for it.
It means playing more back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the whole corner.
The difference is that the Russians want to play free.
They're less shots, and even though they've got a slow bank ahead of them, they're better off playing.
In Czech, they only shoot more.
Didn't it make you a problem traveling and moving over seven hours?

How do Lotish people take care of their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole lot of Latvia is watching hockey, together with basketball is national sport.
Fuck you all.
Even though it didn't happen, a lot of people went.
Did Dinam's move in KHL help to make Latvia a small quarter-final in the annual world empire?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results in the darkness of the world began to rise.
At the 2014 Olympics in Soci, the fourth finish with Canada was 1:2.
That was an unrealistic result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
There's still more Latvian players going to Czech extralegiate.
In Zlyn, Roberts Bukarts crossed the line and before signing the contract is Ralphs Freibergs.
Why is it that they're going so far?
They're not any chicken players, they're really quality.
Today's teams are looking for younger and younger players from abroad, Lotish among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL is starting in three weeks.
Why are you still out of business?
I knew at the beginning of the campaign that I would not continue in Russia.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have to start the generals, we didn't agree.
Then it was classic.
We were dealing with different teams, but they finally decided for someone else.
So I'm going to train home in Zlyna, and I'm gonna wait for something to happen.
Aren't you nervous?
It was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I've been home for a while.
I've discovered something in KHL, so I'm taking it different.
The question is, when and where to sign.
How real is the option that a new anniversary you're going to break up in Zlyn?
It can happen anything.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can just wait for the agent to talk.
Do you prefer any competition?
The current season wasn't like this so I could choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government's going on in Latvia.
In January of the year, I wrote in article S to care for the proper economy? I also wrote about the camp in Flights in Orlík.
The subject matter remains the same, and I will allow the difficulty of mentioning the article.
He's been talking about the camp in Letech for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it'll probably be best when they look at official sites of cultural monuments South City.
There, in the introduction of the historical review, it is found that the camp became two kilometers east of the city of Latvia, that from 8.8. 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1.1 in 1942 it became a collective camp and from 2.8. 1942 it became a Chicago camp.
In the next text, it describes the life course of the camp, including the conditions of the Netherlands, until March 1943, when the first years of prison were registered in world transport.
On 4.5.43, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the hairdresser camp.
All of them were 420.
Very sad stories of the unwarranted outbreaks of human beings, which have caused them even human beings and ideologies.
There is no argument that these events need to be kept in mind.
There is no argument that this reminder should be reflected in the memory of these people in the place of their past suffering.
There's another problem.
Socialism was a little remembered in the Jaksi camp, and in the 1970s, it was close to and was built on the site of the former camp.
The history of the camp was beautifully revealed in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, a memorial was discovered in Latvia in 1995.
In the mid-90 ’ s, the government promised to recover and release the web site, but it has not done so yet.
In 1998 the Memorial was declared a cultural memory and since 2009 its management is under the Lidice Memorial.
In June 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the web.
That's such a very special fact about the favorable judgment of the camp.
The government approved the purchase of the web site and decided to draw up a search warrant for the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will buy back the web.
According to Herman's Minister of Culture, "there are numbers, but I would probably measure the intentions if I went to the public with them."
We'll see what a professional trial will bring.
According to some informal estimates, hundreds of millions can be reached, others say the price can reach up to one billion.
It's not going to be easy in any case.
In addition, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stand as a memorial to which the state had invested nearly ten million dollars in 2010.
Even if the UN Committee on Human Rights has financed the whole transaction properly, which is obviously not dangerous, it would be the same as I think it would be a waste of money.
What does the government have no other priorities?
A memorial, a worthy place, stands for the will of the event, practically in the immediate vicinity of the past tragedy and anyone who wishes can be remembered here by the suffering and the slain.
I don't see any reason why it's changing!
Let's do it the way it is, and let's keep the fifth place with maximum intensity.
On the property entrusted, and on the money of taxpayers, the person responsible should, in this case, be treated by the Government of the Czech Republic with the care of the proper economy.
At least with the same thing as your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government is not the whole government.
However, in view of the above facts, the password of the lead leader of the UN is only as an empty preliminary declaration.
This year, I started looking right at the place.
A very good welcome road, a furnished parking lot, refills of wooden camp bars.
In one exhibition, in another integrated toilet with current water.
A small natural amphitheater with a seating option and with a view to its own southern location, which is made of stones located in a relatively smooth stream.
A lot of flowers and bonds.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as it sounds and belongs.
At present, he is at the place of the original camp of archaeological research.
It would be reasonable to consider, for example, whether it would not be possible to preserve part of the open funds and at least in a way that would be visually accessible.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could inspire his efforts.
In the event that he is able to make a purchase of a web site for state money in the government, this will only be another unfortunate step in his case, which is already quite a problem in the role of the Minister of Culture.
Red mass, milk products and chocolate may reduce symptoms of infectious cancer (IBD)
For your digestive system, it can be red meat and milk products at night.
However, the new study points to the true contrast: the fear of rich in animal protein and milk products could help relieve symptoms of infectious cancer.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom causes breast and blood clots, weight loss and extreme depression.
Patients are usually advised not to consume meat and milk products to moderate their symptoms. However, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acid triptofane containing protein helps to create immune cells that support the rest of the body.
The leading study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells protect the lungs and ensure the disposal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of infected cells is assessed by a number of cells that support tolerance and body protection without causing damage to the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the mixture pushes you to the side of the disease, it can lead to an infectious disease of the cancer.
In the research, scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerances in the stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the creation of a plant of triptofane - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between another bacteria - Lactobacillus Reuters - which is a common part of the immune microbiology and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more Triptophane had muscles in their throat, the more these immune cells had."
He also suggested that if it is shown that it is the same for a person, then the combination of L. reuters and the rich on triptofan would help develop a more flexible and less interesting environment.
The postgraduate research of Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, revealed that one group of testing muscles had these cells, while another group of the same human muscle cells were processed.
The result is that one group of muscles has a variety of cancers - a community of bacteria, viruses and fluids that usually survive in the gastrointestinal tract.
The muscle cancer was tested by a method of sorting DNA and researchers found six types of bacteria in the muscle with immune cells that were developed by the second group of muscles.
The muscle that was stored in the sterilized environment and missed them with explosive microbes - then these types of immune cells - were given L. reuter bacteria - and the immune cells were created.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters into fluids and then transferred a small amount of fluids - without bacteria - into the immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerance cells.
After the removal of the active substance from the fluid, it was shown that the next product of the triptofan metabolism known as indiol-3-octyl acid was present.
When the researchers doubled the amount of triptofane in the dry muscle, the number of these cells increased by 50%. After the dose of triptofane was divided, half of the cells were counted.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as the muscles and most of us maintain L. Reuters bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether subsequent triptofane-bacterial L. reuters cause the development of human cells in the same way as in the muscle, but genetic defects related to triptofane have been detected in humans with infectious cancer.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should most certainly insist on the development of these cells because they control the susceptibility of the internal surface.
Potentially high levels of triptofane in the presence of L. bacterium Reuters may increase the population of the bunker."
José Mourinho considers the signature of the contract with German Matec and his transition to Manchester United for 'genial'
Manchester United got into his team "genia" like Nemanja Matiće - at least that's what José Mourin thinks after what the client started in the middle of the summit against Sampdori.
Matić, who signed the contract for 40 million pounds, introduced himself in the first row to win 2:1 in Dublin - the last presidential run in front of UEFA Superpoher, where the United meets on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and acted in his role as deputy next to Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-sessional Asian tour, Matić did not have a form and played only 45 minutes, according to Mourinha's word, it was necessary to work before the start of the next Premier League season.
"It takes time, but it's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant thought - thinking football," said Mourin.
"We'll help him get to the condition first."
Like Mattić, his new co-players Victor Lindelöf and Romel Luka also played the first game at the Aviva Stadium and Mourin gradually form their uniform for the next season.
The independent source of this week announced that Mourin wants to continue signing the contract with the other three players, but it remains that the club carried out a “fantastic work” and brought three of the four most important players into the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four of four would please me more, but I recognize that they have made a maximum for me."
The life-threatening challenge of the king of the swine-skins of Ládi Hrušky.
He wants to learn from Pohlreich!
This multi-slice picture began to be researched through the new series on TV Prima Zdenňk's Academy.
The Russians had a chance right away.
"My Lady, I would like to join your burning academy because I, with my heart, think I can learn a lot from you," he called it in a video on the social network.
And because they've been spying on him for years, he didn't forget Ládja even this time.
"I can teach you to swim from a diet of chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to water and show you why it's a fallen cheese," Hruška said.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to think about the level and learn from the mystery.
"The question is what the boss is about," said Blesk.
But the majority didn't show up because he had a new piece of his next order, yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to Croatia's participation in the Culinary Academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity outside television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich set up his first cook.
In a few days, she was sold over 300 thousand goats!
The new order that Prima presented yesterday at the printing conference to the underground transmission scheme is an unfalse school of smoking.
The majority choose their dishes from a series of bees, and in the 12 parts they are familiar with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show now the chief is making a mistake in November 2014 he left Zdeněk on the back of his trick to win over the overcrowded mess.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"It's just a smile on that rose - the rose is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladja replied.
He's thinking about Lajo's culinary art.
"I don't think I'm going home because I'm not going to leave the restaurant at all," said the chief.
Pohlreich, I'm very attached to Pohlreich's neck, even if he says I'm making smoke in the middle.
In my order, but his recipes will certainly not appear," he did not leave Croatia.
He's crazy!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analfabe or debilit," said Pohlreich about Hruško in one lecture.
"I don't have twenty to be able to raise my hand over them, but I can't solve them anymore," he pointed out on the account of the cuts of Croatia.
The British inventor uses a microscope in his hand to take off the car and the house by rote
The British explorer became the first man in the country with a microchip attached to the body. With a simple hand, he can unlock the door from the house and the office and even start the car.
Three-year-old Steven Northam left a small chip to implant between the pillar and the indicator and at the same time offers the same service through its BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives by using technology.
According to Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted by dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers the service of exchange of doors and cars, compatible with microchip. The price of one lock is 300 £.
The father of one child allowed the technology to integrate into his home and his car the BMW Z4 label, which starts with a simple mouthful hand.
White House requisition is worth thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to fly with the maritime helicopter to South Lawn to the opportunity of celebrating the American manufacturing industry that took place last month came at $24,000 according to the shipping records issued by the TIME week.
Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the president on the deck, was the top of the program on 17 July in the White House, which was a review of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several senior officials of the White House looked at products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was stationed next to the yachts from Maine, a ski train from Wisconsin and an overcrowded train from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of helicopters within 36 hours prior to the arrival of helicopters in South Lawn in the context of the “extraordinary” event, indicated the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of helicopters.
"I wanted to make sure you had information about such important events," wrote Director HMX-1 in an e-mail to his manager, the seamaster's representative on the day before the start of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn 17th of July about 7:00 on the opportunity of a review, whose beginning is scheduled to be at 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete crossing of the whole place planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail further stated that if it comes to the delay of the flight from the White House, a refund will be sent for the return year due to the working time regulation.
The original crew stayed on the site with the helicopter and with them a unit of security workers.
Of the records - which received the TIME week - it was not fair if the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were sure it was all right," the director wrote.
"It sounds like they're blocking you," the deputy president said.
This preview "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political sub-texts.
On his part, the president made a medical reform that went through the sitting and spoke about efforts to keep the government regulation back.
The use of air transport means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is a challenge for a new phenomenon.
The presidents are using them on their way.
However, their presence is not unusual for the sake of presenting reasons.
Trump ordered control at the bottom of the presidential plane when he first met in the course of his campaign in Melbourne to Florida. His Twitter account was blocked by the difficulties of using his predecessor's presidential plane.
"The White House is pleased with the review of 'Made in America', which represented products from all 50 countries producing American materials," said the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train arrivals in Washington and South Lawn and increase the opportunities with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump, at the beginning of July in Germany, participated in the G-20 group summit, HMX-1 held 58 parties in the White House.
The flight to visit Made in America was part of the current crew trainer, a state worker.
One helicopter on the same day flew into the "non-presidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House indicated that no other records were collected from the taxpayers' money.
The Sikorsky spokesman stated that the company was not interested in any way in the meetings on the construction of a helicopter in South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep record of the budget for the presidential year and the exact cost of the review is difficult to determine, according to the statement of the seafarer.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is the return of the DoD expenditure for VH-3D $24,380 per hour.
The unit records indicate 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters move significantly below the given amount.
"The introduction of the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very impressive," Walters said throughout the matter.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, the cost of DoD costs does not include staff costs, but includes the cost of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The next press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer denied the use of helicopters for inspection purposes.
"The idea of watching this week is to represent products made in the United States," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut companies are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defence of our state and that they are providing jobs to hundreds of people.
I think, just like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that divides the production of American citizens.
This fact is worth mentioning."
It is not clear whether Trump was also on his way to the South Lawn on his way to the helicopter. It can only be said that he was seated as a volunteer of one of the Fascian vehicles.
Back in the White House Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives and joked with the media about their own fleet of products.
"Sikorsky I know very well," said the president, "I own three immediately."
A young woman brought her to the pool at Mach Lake, the police sailed to her.
The girl went out to the beach on Sunday morning in the second hour of the morning.
But instead of buying, she was stuck in the mud.
When she decided to call the police on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"That's why police soon lost contact with her," reported police spokesman Ivan Balák.
At the place that she was about to describe, several police officers appeared, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police had to sail hundreds of miles of raccoons before they felt a firm ground again," Balák said.
And the same thing was wrong.
The police were guided by the direction from which her call for help came.
"In order not to come to this connection at least, they agreed with her that the vote would rest," said the speaker.
The police found a woman at three in five in a church in Borný.
She was on the ground of physical and mental forces and took notes.
That's why the so-called sanitizer transferred her to a cescopic hospital.
The Uncle's alliance with the STAN?
There's no news that's becoming a saleswoman.
It's a little irony.
With its web project searchmessny.cz, as a billionaire would say to voters in general that the STAN is suffering from the deficit of the people who are listening.
And he also argued that political parties do not generate more famous old and independent parties, in fact, have no national programme for mass elections.
Her willing candidate will only be able to be a good person after talking to Grandpa, with any political opinion.
He started out like this once, and it just didn't work out.
With his attention to the people and personalities who, if any, are rewarded by the candidates, some of the elderly, who have also left the Gazdík, more than Santa Claus's beloved chief argument that the greatest value is the political audit and experience of the elderly, traditionally the most popular policies, and according to studies.
Now they're calming up quickly gathered unknown personalities.
The total divorce with the people who have changed the logo and the slogan after the Stan explained that the hunter does not want to lose his identity on the candidates.
But if the TAN of identity was suspecting only a small one, after Grandfather's coming, he's only playing the identity game.
Not only did the Gazdík have a long stand against ANO Andrej Babiše, at the first joint press, but Grandpa, who is publicly praised by Babies, said: "My goal is to win the ANO, then the Starost's strike was to be won by twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't break his neck.
Grandfather is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not an accident.
He often talks about politics like Babish, but he doesn't have his own political character.
TAN has long remembered the reality of the show more than the real political party and Grandfather's helping hand as if from no news she's doing more to a saleswoman.
For a while, Stan went with TOP 09, then with people, and now he's looking for obedient people to change.
Let's hope someone's calling.
Police dogs have been riding in the bridge with a wheelchair.
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and tailed dogs have grown in the lake Most of the flights with a vertigo.
The police dog must not be baseless and have fear of flying, said the leader of police cynoologists in Austria, Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training lasts two years.
There was a lot of fun in the bridge as a grown-up dog training, so those who go through the training first.
According to the standard training they had to take in heavy fuel samples around the lake and search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to climb into the refrigerator and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of exercise is to test dogs in the refrigerator.
The dog could go to work without having a problem with a wheelchair.
"Tomášek said, "The dog goes and immediately seeks."
A dog that is unsatisfied or is not able to start working right away on the way to the wheelchair is cut off from the course.
"Most of them then leave the dogs on the garden, for example," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in Austria.
They control German shepherds, but also Belgian shepherds.
He's got a dog on him.
"He's doing it on his own, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animals undergo repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal any medical condition.
If the dog is healthy and non-fatal, it shall be the first test in 20 months.
"It's about two and a half years long," Tomášek added.
The length of the police service depends on the health status of the dog.
Most of them serve eight to ten years.
Then most of them live in their dogs.
Trailer in the 3rd season of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is outside the game and Cali Cartel is becoming the center of Netflix
Despite the closing of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's murder was discovered, Netflix's series will not be over.
The approval by the streaming service was already expected for the third and fourth season - firstly named for the first trailer and for the creation of other obstacles.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential motorists, they operate “as a company from Fortune 500,” in contrast with the fact that they are promoting violent acts and exploiting more and more government actors.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is a director of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis) plays the brain of surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) has an old connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is in charge of New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal is returned as Javier Peña, becoming an American and Colombian rights activist in the fight against drugs.
Among the other priests are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bisè and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will resume its Prime Minister on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on women in politics
The elections may be credible only if all the members of the association, including women, have been introduced to the UN representative centre in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that the election of local representatives is a percentage of women, three women are in favour of vice-presidentship and more than 30% of new registered voters are women.
"The role of a woman cannot be seen," he said in his mid-term statement.
The elections can be fully representative and reliable only if they are involved and women, as well as all relevant processes related to elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has published several challenges to the voluntary process, which is moving international war on the other side.
In the annual elections, the first democratically elected government is to hand over its power to the next government in peace.
Haysz indicated that women's strong role is strengthening the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Volunteer Commission stated that of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women are created.
The unique beer is burning beer again.
Good beer to re-enacted beer.
The excitement and beauty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of the pivovar in Lobchi in Mšena.
Pivovar, the first mentioned in 1586, has a renaissance core and has been stopped in the 19th century.
She was following the summer of the revolution when the beer was most popular with dark beer.
During the second world war, the production was unfortunately halted and the beer was born in 1984.
Since then, they've been serving the building for a state ship.
Part of the story reached the owners of the beer after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and cut down on building material.
In 2007, however, there was a new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jany and Paul Prouzov.
They started to fix the buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully studied archival materials, try to preserve original materials and construction properties.
The beer has the same image as in the 19th century when its golden era began.
Their work was evaluated by the Pivovar declaration for the cultural memory of the Ministry of Culture and the construction was also part of the European industrial heritage chain.
In 2015 the tradition of beer burning was celebrated.
If you want to enjoy a great lobby beer in the small region of Kokoreńska, visit the ski resort in the area of the beer.
When brewing beer here, they use Korean water that flows into protected rural areas, salts from the lobe fields and žateký molluscs.
You enjoy traditional light beds on the floor, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't worry about watching a beer, it's going on Saturday and Sunday in the afternoon and in the afternoon.
The largest steel company in Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest strengths of your type in the global scale?
This unique building had to be the stability of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žaclére, at the top of the field cemetery above the village of Babi.
At first, it had to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected with a vast subterranean.
There should be leadership, cassary, ammunition, materials, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
But the building ended the Munich Agreement.
Within a few years, this was the only possible railway station and underground spaces were removed.
Thanks to the climbers from Stachelberg, who started the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also see here.
The land has already been accessible by 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 windscreen, the area is covered with exposed and ground and equipped with a light refurbishment object, there are two other scattered windscreens, reservoirs and scientific trails Refurbished Trutnosk.
The decoration, the burning altar and the spectacular views of the country are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building came to the list next to such monuments as the Great China Wall, Traian's port in Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrudu.
Klášter Chotèšov originally began in the early 13th century, which is now making the most powerful four-wheel building of the Convention over the beautiful garden.
The list he's got, but unfortunately it belongs to a unique building that threatens the future.
But the superheroes don't want to give up, and they've got a lot of actions to do with the support of the monastery.
One of them is the next dinner anniversary for the Cochèšov monastery this Saturday of fifth August, where it presents me. Vladimír Misík, Ivan Hlas, you will see the Shermish exhibition and look at the place of beautiful bright buildings that are usually unavailable.
Mostly, you enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look at non-intruders in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to Neanderthals in the Pavilion of Anthropos Moravska National Museum in Brná lies on an uninterrupted tour into the deepest period of stone, into the world of our ancestors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with the most diverse extreme climate conditions, mainly by cutting time between ice and ice.
And through their simple material culture, they were constantly successful preachers of their time.
Learn also how they seemed to have what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting mind were, but also their aesthetics.
That you wouldn't tell non-industrials?
Let me convince you in Brno.
The fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival runs on Friday at the town of Veveř.
In addition to great music, you will see the construction of Celtic villages, try the Celtic way of life, including puzzles for children and adults, painting, magic or ritual painting on the body.
There will be no lack of La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, bubonic jamming, game on the head and amazing fire surprises in the Carpe Night.
How's Moravsky?
Seven anniversary of a well-known gastrofestival How it tastes Moravskoslöskoslök horse is on Saturday, 5 August 2017 in the area of the mountain resort Karla Studánka.
Warit will be chief Miroslav Kalina, enjoy culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy musical and dance exhibitions, rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping hill, Shmouli competition hall and of course a series of competitions.
Meet the plant with one click.
Students with herbarians and ordinary lovers growlin will help new free Pl@ntNet application.
If they're going to be interested in which plant they just hit on the passageways, these applications will help them.
The only thing they will have to do is take photos of the plant and the application itself is aware of what kind it is.
The new application available for iOS and Android was presented on Tuesday by the representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education of CEEV in the Bratislavic Horslav Park under the City's Secret Life Project.
The project included 50 Czech and Slovenian schools who took photos of the application database with teachers and added plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French app is free to download on the websites of the City's Secret Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make the most of the people involved in the application with their photos, thereby increasing the number of plants that can be identified by the application.
"Children who hold the tablet or cell phone in their hands may fall into the forest," said the coordinator of this project Ivana Poláčková.
On the basis of sufficient quality photos of flowers, leaves or fruit plants, the application can be identified within a few seconds, which will then be arranged in Czech and Slovenian under the photograph.
The French gave us permission to translate into Slovenian and Czech applications into the city's Danish life project.
Therefore, it is welcome that users can add a picture of plants that are not yet available in the database when the account is placed into the application.
"Francouizes whether it is profitable and then adds it to the database," Polish reported.
Interest of GMB on investments in McVitie's company in Glasgow
The committees require assurance from the manufacturer of McVitie's drying plant about the long-term obligation to produce in a factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish GMB Board of Directors has indicated that the company is currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross industry.
He works in the factory for more than 500 employees who manufacture other than other products and Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis company, stated that over the past few years, she has invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area.
He added that employees and representatives of the committees will be “between the first informed” in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB Committee expressed its concern that McVitie's "will not be given its promises on the financing and modernisation of production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many families and employees have worked here, mostly from the local community and the area of Glasgov, where the work at present represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the field of high unemployment and social decision-making.
From the point of view of work, wages and prosperity - and despite the view of Brexit, the cost of living and the slowing of small production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs the hope of a prosperous producer, whose name is McVitie's."
Pladis’s spokesman said: “The resident Tollcross received a letter from the GMB yesterday and the company publishes the first statement as we appreciate the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the committees.
The regular meeting with the staff and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and a lot of problems were discussed at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and insecure economic conditions, we appreciate our operation on a regular basis, which pays for all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million freedoms in the Tollcross area, particularly in manufacturing lines and operating efficiency.
We highly appreciate the legacy of Tollcross and other localities and, in the case of any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and representatives of the committees will be informed without delay."
She warned PSG Barcelona to move Neymar three years ago?
La Liga will be able to mourn her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germany does not allow its efforts to acquire Neymara on its side after it had made 189 million euros, so the amount needed to buy Neymara out of the contract, but he warned this French team of Barcelona about his record-taking already three years ago?
This sedentary transition has widened the waters of summer crossings. Club League 1 is ready to cross over more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's transition to Manchester United, which paid for him in the London season of $89 million.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax will be collected from the PSG team over $500,000 a week.
Barcelona is disappointed by the way Neymar has been exported from his contracts, despite the fact that he has confirmed a reliable source that the club has always tried to convince Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this fact three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matudiho in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned all clubs that would be interested in overcoming one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll certainly tell one of their players," Al-Khelaif said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences."
It appears that Barcelona exceeded the mental limit when it expressed interest in the PSG representative Marca Verratti in summer.
The PSG made it clear that, under no circumstances, it would not allow the departure of the Italian representative. So it is possible that Barcelona, for her trophies now, now with the departure of Neymara, has a hot pill.
Who's explaining the sanctions?
Does political punishment have a broad understanding of rules?
Donald Trump was on anti-terrorist sanctions.
A day earlier, the United States had imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And yet a day ago, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it will not go on.
And from that, it's a cleaner thought of the sanctions as a piece of bot.
These things can't be locked into one pit.
Madura Venezula was really on the way to the dictatorship, because of the totality.
China's just not acting like the president of the United States.
Russia's capital for itself.
But if someone wanted to hide all this so that even a ordinary volunteer, American, European or other, understood what he was doing and what the system of regulation was involved in, it would be almost impossible to do so.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only asks what President Obama has already found, but only gave a ruling.
So why such a mess?
Loni was afraid of Europe if she won the U.S. volleyballs Trump, we'd go with Putin and call for sanctions.
It's a terrible show.
But it's really wrong.
The Troupe doesn't release the sanctions, but they're speeding up.
Only Europe is afraid more.
German Prime Minister Zypries says the Trompo sanctions violate international law.
It's like cosher's only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
However, there are no EU anti-terrorist sanctions.
The head of the European Commission, Juncker, again complains that the Trompo sanctions threaten EU energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
A regular fan of tapes.
For three years, he heard that the judgments against the anti-virus sanctions depend only on compliance with the Ministries Agreements on the right of Ukraine.
It is now known as EU energy security.
Love taupe and wider.
In Russia, sanctions are coming because it's too much to be mounted where it's not.
China's a little bit tired of mounting.
The Venezuelan President is convicted of building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or just ideas have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, a rule or a rule?
Andrej Babish: I don't think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, circled the Republic with his vision book and finalized the voluntary program.
Except for the Pardubic country, he's already got all his candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not literally record them.
He even agreed to have the Moravskossläschk here to meet with the ANO Ivo Vondrák Stinister of School.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a messenger or a hero," confirmed his previous position, Babish.
With all the representatives and the national policies, you were angry that the elders and primers should direct the cities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Do you really think so?
It wasn't like that.
I am the recipient of direct democracy, we love the President, and I am convinced that we should also love the elderly and the prime minister.
In my book, I'm not talking about destroying agents. They can be there quietly.
It's a question of how many of them will be.
At the presentation of your book on what I'm recording when I sleep, I heard on my own ears that you were talking about breaking up representatives.
You don't remember that.
I was talking about direct elections and reducing the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the receiver is counting on a little bit to set up and not complete big projects, but she has no competence for that.
It also pays for the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I don't say they did well.
The current prime minister, but he doesn't control anything, he's just fashioning the debate.
That's why it can't work.
That's why you want to cross the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to change.
In the program, we only have a change in the one-off election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a closed mandate of Ministers and the adjustment of the Rules of Procedure to prevent the remaining exhibitors who should work mainly in committees and committees, from attending the meetings of the House.
It certainly is not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
Only your opponents are afraid of it.
That as a dictator, you will manage the government, check the record with 101 Members, destroy the country and the Senate, and rule the whole country through grateful elders and primers.
Well, it's definitely not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron announced a reduction of the legal assembly on the third, and there are 57,000 French lawmakers, while we have 17,000 Czechs.
Macrona is still nobody's fault of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won most of the elections, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The evidence for those who have a majority of parliaments is, however, large enough to look into Poland or Hungary.
There is no danger in the case of an ANO attack.
We just need a team that will work for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't need to understand why we couldn't agree that it's just higher pay for teachers, cultural workers and social services.
Why would they vote and add 21 percent to the GIBS, who are now taking 60 thousand?
Would you like to take that as a prime minister?
The Prime Minister should be involved when ministers behave in an uneconomic manner, he would like to run with the travel office and for the money of the state like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers don't have to argue in the government, they have to say the same thing.
There's no place for co-exting, no loud voice and no hats, there's to be decided.
How do you want to have a team in charge when ministers behave mainly side-by-side?
There's a constitutional law on the side.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition contract was not paying, and he expelled Babies from the government.
This can be done by any prime minister.
But if it is personality and has leadership ability, a similar gesture plan is not needed.
It measures everything the same and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you'd suggest to the finance minister?
I don't even think about it, because we're probably not even going to work with this government, and no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done.
That's not what it's like.
The elderly have found a businesswoman who would like to cooperate with you, and in the people you may have won the crown of your forced Jiří Čunka.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the association with ANO, in the ODS it may be used by Václav Klaus ml, who will not oppose it either.
I'd like to leave it to the wolves.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of the UNO Richard Brabec said you have many points with the SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the ocamurists come to mind as coal partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he's been running for the VV, then he's getting money from the Society for his company, and he's been there for a while.
Of course he is an outstanding personality.
It's kind of urgent somewhere.
When I take the program, there is a wide involvement of people in society, direct democracy, which can be agreed.
I'm not asking you anything about it at all.
I wonder if a friendly person who has xenophobic views is talking to demonstrators and wants to come out of the EU?
We don't think of cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine it.
It's obvious he went to politics to benefit from it.
And what is the silent support of the Communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but they're determined to do it.
It's about winning with each other in order, but God knows who's winning and who's two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on the Coalition Government programme.
Let's go back to your efforts to be a company.
But the government just has to run, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, he has never decided.
Coalities such as CEB or EGAP did not function.
Because Sobotka is his lawyer, and that was also my reason why he threw me out.
As soon as he did, Chez ruled the Czech government.
However, it is unbelievable that the prime minister has brought a resolution written by the ČEZ management, which will give finance ministers how to vote at the ČEZ fair.
If you become a prime minister, will you change your personal measurements in the Board's survey and replace the ČEZ top management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm a prime minister, I'll see you.
I'm not her yet.
It's a joke that Chez has already sent the signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to change for even better with the UN.
Well, maybe after the calls, it's all going to eat again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Lobbit of Pokorne or Rose, I'm an independent unit, and I don't even get rid of it.
So answer me directly.
If you stand in the head of the government, will you force the change of leadership of the Czech TV or the General Health Insurance, then the institutions that you criticise?
I'd like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
He's been doing what he wanted for years, and thanks to the traditional political parties.
It's enough to check Mr. Schwarzenberg's records.
Although he had to stand in the ČEZ Majorate, he never directed him, he was there only in numbers, which is bad.
It's a trivial matter for me.
WHAT Dukovani should take, evaluate it, throw it into a subsidiary, arrange funding, make an additional competition or join a co-investor and set up a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state has to finance and create new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her orders are bringing me a permanent target campaign, but I don't and I won't have any competence to challenge anyone.
But rule yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public advertising and television charges of 7.2 billion dollars a year, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How do you know he doesn't?
On the other hand, the Council agrees with the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the position of the general directors of the ČT and ČRO.
See how these reports are being processed on the super power package Sobotka Godusek, which has always worked.
It pays for the current parliamentary commission for the students from the research records, as well as for the lessons of Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let the gods touch me to get out of the government, which played a percentage of TOP 09, but ČSSD picked it up.
They're afraid of ruining their corrupt system, and so they're talking about threatening Babish democracy.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President of UNO Jaroslav Faltýnik builds a powerful ground by bringing his son to the Council's opinion of Tepláren Brno and arranges for an agreed lawyer, Quatoslav Hlín's contract with the city and state companies, such as the Prague transport company or the Czech dragons?
That's where we have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I read it several times.
The counterfeit argues that the cited lawyer works mainly at lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, Kratochvil, Bresin.
If we had any sign of censorship, we would've fired such a man right away.
I'm not compromised in this direction.
If something like that happens, we'll get rid of anyone, it's totally one who would be.
