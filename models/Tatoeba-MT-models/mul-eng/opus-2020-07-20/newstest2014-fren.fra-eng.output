"Wingsuit" show above Bogota
The sportsman Jonathan Florez celebrated the day of a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
A wingsuit (a small aisle combination), is over 160 km/h above the famous monasteries of Monserrate, located over 3,000 metres high, where many baths were gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners have a bad idea of finding the money needed to repair the road infrastructure in a short time, many are having a solution in the form of a small black box that is located above the board of your car.
The devices, which record all thousands of cars and transmit information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and the government offices of planning to maintain the absolute funding system of major American roads.
The sector, generally uninterested in the planning of large axes, has generated a strong debate and strong alliances.
The libertarians joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep the track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road on which you travel, then use the information to edit a bill.
The Tea Party is on fire.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of private life.
And while Congress members do not agree to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, during the next decade, they will be able to go through a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental virus.
This is really necessary for our nation.
"It's not as if we had the choice," said Hassan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who provides that the State begins to record thousands of car accidents by every California car in 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure stems from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by the taxes the Americans pay for the pumps, is financially fragile.
The Americans don't understand much more than before.
Cars can travel more than a thousand miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased since 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 percent, while the essence prices are high.
"The tax on essence is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at Minnesota University.
His State recently installed trailers on 500 cars to test a payment system to the thousand.
"This seems to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wunks calls it the cost of using the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea is seducing liberarians, as taxes could be used to change behavioural patterns in order to reduce greenhouse gases and emissions, for example.
California's planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious laws on climate recovery.
However, the representative, Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the Chamber of Representatives, stated that he would also consider it the most viable option in the long term.
The free market participants of the Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying drivers to the mill.
"It's not just a tax that is involved in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are seeking.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretaries to Transport, who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to go in the way of payment to the millennium.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-M pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
However, the Presidency of the Chamber has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel thousands of miles every day to work or city.
Nevertheless, many States and large cities are making progress.
The most determined is the Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These car drivers will soon pay to the State of mileage instead of tax on essence.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City's dream is one.
Illinois is trying a test on a number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studied how it could implement the change.
The concept is not universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their best practices and practices.
"The concerns of Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who is managing the strategic management of performance in the Department of Transport of Nevada.
It's not something people want.
Since the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU has warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into fully localized devices."
There is no need to build a huge and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will be unsurpassed in order to preserve the records of people's daily departures and arrivals.
Nevada is part of a few States that are now seeking to find an affordable technology that would enable the State to know how many miles a car passes, but not knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small start-up from California on the name of True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not intend to help car drivers paying taxes to States.
She was trying to find out in the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay for their mileage.
But the devices it tested have more to plan for large axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Serious errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are less honorary means and less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different options to car drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment, preferring to pay a standard based on the average number of thousands per capita in the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to poor citizens by allowing the equipment to do more, rather than sufficient.
In New York City, transport operators are seeking to develop a tax device that would also be equipped to pay the station costs, provide a "performance payment" insurance and create a set of data on real-time speeds from other drivers that car drivers could use to avoid traffic accidents.
"The motorists would be encouraged to participate in the benefits offered by the system," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on payment to the mill is not just a huge difference.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the Bay area of San Francisco, the officials say Congress could easily manage the Highway Trust Fund failure by increasing the tax on the essence.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume much of their income, so that each pays its fair share.
"There is no need to resort to radical surgery when there is simply a need for aspirin," Randy Rentschler, the director of public law and business with the Commission.
If this is done, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about the protection of their private life and a range of other things.
David Bowie: Four Indessions in Listen
The English musician didn't just surprise this year.
From The Next Day, in January, he made a revised luxury version scheduled for November 4, with several independences.
Four have already risen on the Toile.
The announcement of the appearance of a new album by David Bowie had left the whole Pantois world.
On its 66th anniversary, on 8 January 2013, he declared that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, 2003 date) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to scintilize the pop scene.
A party for her fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than a round in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he celebrated a real festival for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in three forms: the original album, free studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already opened clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain the total 10 additional titles in relation to the original album: the three Deluxe edition poems, five songs especially released for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful cover in a video.
It introduced both of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and posters, a card to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives a preview of its new Atomica title, typically in the wine of The Next Day, with very early guitars and a highly controlled rock electricity.
Inhibits already heard
But Atomica is not the only title to release her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toilet.
The Informer is double-faced: an intro worrying before a light horse ride that progressively slows down to leave a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, does Bowie want to make a little reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, even to Gravity?
With this title added, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has feet on earth.
Space Odity, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his foreignness: would he come from another planet?
The flow of guitars, sending, gives the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie shows herself in any event to play the camel with these titles: information tour, man on the side of a fusada, potential martini...
It looks and reveals both, playing to adopt different personalities, as it has done all along its career, including its characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Not surprisingly, therefore, he had a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to the Travel, of the brand Louis Vuitton, which he takes in his new face.
It will appear in one of their publications, broadcast from 10 November.
Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, stressed that wounded soldiers were not in a summary release from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by liberarians and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson made sure that before their release, members of the army had followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them have been released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the Government of wanting to save money without allowing wounded soldiers - who do not respond to the military's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the period of 10 years of eligibility required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadiane, including that of a freed soldier last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reserveman in Ontario, was released from the army despite his request to stay for a further year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Colonel Glen Kirkland, who announced to a parliamentary committee last month that he had been moved to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of the service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to start with plans and consultations, but that was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with the Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major wars in Afghanistan, the army has been trying to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit for the fight.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have suffered for up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that 199 of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons did not reach the required service period to obtain retirement benefits.
The liberal spokesman for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, called for the reintegration of Cap. Hawkins, while neo-democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney set on tablets to launch an animated series
The American Media and Entertainment Group Disney decided to prefer the tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The nine first episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on the watchdisneyjunionor.com site or through its application for telephones and tablets.
His global launch on Disney group chains is only planned in 2014, detailing the announcement of his Disney Junior division.
The animated design, for children from 2 to 7 years of age, describes the adventures of Callie's cat, the sheriff of a West American city where she regulates the order with a magic laser.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interfering with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, vice-president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the Communication.
This type of experience comes from Disney's efforts to "extreme the life span of his series and build new relationships with his audience thanks to more important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of less than 2 years of age have already worked on a tablet or a phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, respectively 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence service spokesman, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Thursday, Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to criminalize political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, it is accused of spying and flying State assets.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will be able to make it possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany were severely tested as a result of complaints by the NSA on the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary group that oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely destroying relations with the United States, he would have to take advantage of it.
Mr. Ströbele, German President, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be safe there, said the honourable Member.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "hard and sustained persecution campaign" that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression act".
Citizens around the world as well as high officials, including the United States, have concluded that the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent monitoring was of public interest.
The letter continues to offer cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and finally the video service on Netflix's application via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far.
The Cogeco branch indicated on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests on the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to value more contemporaneous interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco's president and chief executive, Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Cable thus owes no advantage to its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco branch has not yet had a precise date for this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and forget," said Mr. Audet.
The last goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The telecoms agent Rogers has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that their service is available through their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cáble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper in its speech to the Throne on October 16th.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"It's almost two and a half years since we say that the idea of forceing consumers to buy important chains doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) would be based on interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco.
The CRTC has been consulting the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the coming spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that he had recorded a net benefit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ by action.
This is a return compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¿ per share, of the same period in the last year.
The company established in Montréal explains the cost of amortisations related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor established in the United States in 2012 for 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the demonstration company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the amount of 526 million.
As for the income of Cogeco, they have seen an increase of 41.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main branch, Cogeco Cáble, was 43.9 million, or 90 million per operation, calculated by 45.7 million, or 93 million per share, of the same period in the last year.
However, the income of Cogeco Cable has increased from 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers in Cogeco Cáble rose 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about seeing the number of clients running out of luck.
For me, this is not the indication of a change of attitude, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to another with a very live competition.
From horse in products to cattle
Of the horse meat has been decomposed in cattle-based storage boxes, sold by two small British low-cost distribution teachers, the food hygiene agency has announced today.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in Romania in January and sold by the channels Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained 1-5% horse DNA.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A survey on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes has been released in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's examinations, France was the most affected country by the presence of such meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles took four wounded, early Friday, on the 131th road in Lanaudière.
Just four hours ago, a car driver traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost his car master and lost a car coming in the other direction.
The four owners of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic was normal until 6:00 p.m.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement, it indicated that passengers could carry the unopened pen with them to the bottom of the plane.
The new baggage costs relate to the bags listed in the upper room, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said she would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the ship's door.
The Frontier spokesman, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage passengers to pay the costs in advance.
"We do not want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers began to pay the first and second bags recorded in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much things as they could in the bags in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These costs are a way of ensuring that passengers transport less on board.
O'Malley said these new costs will not really serve to collect money.
This is to make sure that customers in Frontier understand the most faithful that it becomes increasingly difficult to find the place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the boat to a port of ship Frontier could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in the boat could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they arrive at the door.
Frontier baggage costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other costs, but airlines worship them.
They believe that baggage maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street view the addition of baggage costs as a sign that air companies pay enough cash to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, a large number of them have not been affected by baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first baggage costs three years ago, and the Alligian low-cost company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, who announced the consultant to the airlines Jay Sorensen, who follows closely the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the costs of Spirit's baggage were $50 a year.
Sorensen, an old Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled to Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the shipping door when passengers would discover the unusual baggage costs imposed by the company.
"I've never seen a shipping procedure so fluid from all my professional career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth cuts and a bagar to open the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passers are mounted on board at the speed of lighting."
Frontier also does like Spirit and apply $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened pen with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
She'll always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but it came back seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline company followed.
Frontier's decision to pay baggage costs when passengers do not directly pay their tickets to the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Air companies pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of online travel agencies.
However, Frontier is far away in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through a online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased by a online travel agency would result in 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful client in his city of origin, Denver, but his business is stolen and it loses money.
The revenues decreased by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results published by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to re-direct Frontier's funds by selling the airline.
NSA causes an internal error and not information pirates for the panel of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow declared on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panel of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers like some have claimed it online.
"NSA.gov has been unavailable for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spy agency in a statement by email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations under which the panel was due to an attack on distributed service data [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been in use for at least 6 hours, and some users could not always access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was not "not of all" compromises.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least a group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the NSA site panel by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to launch a target site until the servers are loaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-attack is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the intended system.
The NSA is also a further secret, a time known as "No Such Agency", found under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticised over the past months following a series of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programmes – which are part of the NSA's secret files to the agency and disclosed by the former consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund owned by the building has sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not always found a new job.
Delta promises not to let her employees fall.
Employees came to see employees directly on the ground, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director for the Labour Relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The close of Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund owned by this building had options to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue his operation, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition was very cheerful, and there were many new hotels in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else, and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, a director of the Traat Tourism Charry School of UQAM's Sciences Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for elderly people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be seen here two years ago.
For Titan's PDG, "The Goodyear Amiens Purchase Project starts with zero employees"
After sending the sponge with faileds in January for the partial recovery of the Amiens-Nord Goodyear site promised for closure, Maurice Taylor, PDG of the American pneumatic Titan, says today is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 that accounts for the plant.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Product Retirement, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After you cancelled the vehicle purchase project in January, you are back today.
You have pronounced violent attacks and insults, talking about "soi-disanting workers", which "work three hours" every day, "foos unions", looking at the CGT.
We don't understand this time-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to make anyone happy.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries, eight hours of work is spent on disabled people in France.
In India, China and in many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices on France.
What I see, it's a plant that manufactures good agricultural pines, has good equipment, is well-placed and has space to grow.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
However, with the right price and competent workers, this is worth the effort.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up compensation, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys at Goodyear the closed plant.
From then on, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens facility with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
Mr. Montebourg also needs a Titan commitment before trying to bring the CGT to sit on the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear are seeking an agreement on starting-up benefits for all employees.
At that time, there will be no more employees in the facility.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting-up payments.
If all employees accept them, the vehicle purchase project will start with zero employed.
How can we provide long-term employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg comes to the conclusion that CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan is buying the plant, we have a strong intention to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The benefit of Bombardier is low, while the delivery and command of aircraft requires
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in his net profit on Thursday, under the pressure of a reduction in orders and supplies of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in his Trains Division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has no further data on flight testing for all his new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will respect its ambitious commercial service schedule before September.
After the inaugural flight of the pilot aircraft there was about a month and a half, the latter wanted only three times, and the question was then asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results have not been high and the course of action has been 8 per cent at the Toronto Forum.
Cameron Doerkssen, an analyst within the National Financial Bank, dropped his note on Thursday, passing "super-performance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of the increase in the course of the next quarter or two next quarter.
"Although the drop in air supplies has been largely anticipated, we are truly relieved by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doersksen in a note to customers.
We think Bombardier will record new orders for his CSeries on the ground and as soon as the pilot programme is in progress.
However, if no new order has been announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sensitive to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was launched in March and landed for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of closed orders for CSeries aircraft is modest to date at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and the potential of the new line aircraft's economy.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments to 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and head of the board, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 closed commands before the first aircraft is placed in commercial service.
The leaders also encouraged the analysts and the Thursday media by indicating that the programme was moving in line with the calendar.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground for longer than planned," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that tests on the ground and software updates were planned during the time of the aircraft's stop.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to proceed to a first flight and plan an update period, and that is what we have done.
This will be re-produced throughout the flight programme.
The second of the five pilots should be sent in the coming weeks, the others will follow a little later, the company has indicated.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was in the process of evaluating the entry calendar in service and would provide further information over the coming months.
"This launch of flight tests – although apparently in accordance with Bombardier's internal calendar – strengthens our view that the entry into service will be suspended in the first quarter of 2015," said Mr. Doerssen.
On the third quarter of September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 M, or 8 cents per share, compared to 172 M, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted action result was unchanged by 9 percent.
The income was slightly collected from 4.2 to 4.1 MD.
Analysts expected 10 cents per action and $4.56 MD income, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 years earlier.
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 before.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 MD to 30 September, a variable figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were declining,” said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautic income dropped by 13 per cent to reach $2.Md.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, reported that the income of this division had increased from around 11% to 2.1 billion MD.
The order card of the Transport Division totalled $32.6 MD to 30 September, or slightly increased from 31 December of the previous year.
The Transport Division's margins have been affected by implementation problems with regard to some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's action course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit on the board of directors, fell from $8.5 per cent to $4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third aeronautical manufacturer and competes in Bombardier's nearest competition, reported a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23-27-year-old spéléologists had been missing in a golf course under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, and they had been trained on Friday at the Isère Sèléo rescue.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one party to the practice and the other not, were on the ground on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
There has been no news of them since then, the same source has been specified.
"Specialists should have attended around 5 a.m. in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to Spéléo in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on the ground
Twenty paracursors, ten members of the French Speléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and pumpers were on the ground.
At the end of the afternoon afternoon, the two spelologists were located.
"It is another group of spéléologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the city, sent information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th battle of Chambéry's Alpine Chambéry's Chambery Chambery's Alpine chasseurs were found to be "extended, but not injured".
They lost in the network, returned on their way waiting for relief, explained the prefecture.
Realized, they should withdraw from the welcome with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists union invited Thursday its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services on the following day for further updates on the activities of American and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid the new order to use Google and Yahoo search engines and messages," she said in a communiqué.
It judges "candals" the information of Washington Post, according to which the National U.S. Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government of Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union that claimed 38,000 members.
Repeated fires: a member seeks the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "relifting" of the signalling lamps in Brussels does not appeal to the whole world.
To recall, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this afternoon at the centre of Brussels a draft test to repeat 16 signalling lamps in the region to the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both to "increase security" and "bruiseless identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repeat all the brussels signalling lamps for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "trip-funk", according to the Brazilian Member, Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flanning" the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "demission".
"We are not pleased to spend a lot of money on Brussels's relieving of signalling signals to the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its capital flashing operations," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxes, she finally repeated herself in yellow- blue-white-red-black Brussels's trolleys.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brussels ministers deserve more than seeing their money spent by a CD&V minister who personally implements the NVA programme.
It's time to stop Troie's horse from the Flanders.
"To remember, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only by 2,245 votes to 0.5% of Brussels!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the Port of Pont-de-Bus demounted
The Scottish port of Pont-de-Buis, around which was held on Saturday a violent protest against this tax, was held on Thursday morning.
Grapes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and the movement on the country was broken into the crowd.
The decision of the management, announced by the Prefecture of the Mercredi Finistère, was taken by Ecomouv, the port manager.
This is the last of the three eco-taxes in operation in the Finistère department, the other two were demounted or sabouted.
Launching a Google Glass accessories store
A online store, offering multiple accessors dedicated to Google Glass, has recently been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signged satellites.
They can thus acquire an audience, a driver, or even a ranking study.
This store, strictly reserved for developers already available from Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a carrier and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a micro-fibre protective box or an intra-auricular speaker.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with fine wines, no large-scale marketing date has yet to be confirmed.
Five years ago, my father was expelled from the world of the living.
At first I didn't kill him, I was talking about him right now,
I was so scared of forgetting it or I didn't know how I would go on "freaking".
There is no income, employment mode to pass the wall of the invisible and find the senses.
Then signs appeared.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the seat while I was driving.
Another time, a soft night-long wake-up to watch her show that doesn't leave me anymore, put on the night table.
It's the picture of my smiling father who accompanied me in my daily gloves.
Our mother left us after her battle against cancer.
That's at least what I thought about the day I found his body empty, crisscrossed on this hospital bed to the frozen bodies.
Also, its funnels were a glazed glazed clay around the main hole of the canals that would cross its circle.
I thought she was part of it.
Little by little, by little daily or night appearances, a bit shy, a little frustrated, she quickly came back into my mind, moving toward the fur and as she took her place in the landscape of my mind that seemed to be lost.
And then, she showed up at all by revealing to me my own faces that I had not yet understood, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person, but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who cared about that person during his stay in life.
At death, this woman had perfect life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This decline in the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that people who love us never leave us.
I'm like my father, "to the teeth like the outside" is what he looks like.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he became old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I was hurt...
He talked to me, he encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at my eyes, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscriminate.
I could have a personal life.
He would leave me alone.
It's been a long time since one day it's gone.
Finally, it was comforting and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents aren't anymore, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mention it: what would they have said? What would they have thought? What would they have done?
I'm constantly dreaming of them, maybe not all night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, just there's always something that keeps me going.
I often wake up excited when this happens to me and I feel deeply left out.
Sometimes, some dreams bring me to the opposite end and are written in my history and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The guard of my echography where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I woke up, I was out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor, and he would be so happy I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my bedroom to mean that he would happily share what had happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I'd like to tell you this common memory after his death.
Just five years ago, my mother would move from cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused to the young basketball player I was at the time.
I've done everything I've done, but I've done everything fast enough.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times of difficulty, or even when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to make it a master in a large school, have not been, with the recult, anadine choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before rehabilitating France at the time of independence.
The values she has entrusted to me are still present, although it comes to me to think about how she would like me to act at a given moment.
This is also true of my attitude: I try to be at the height of the generosity and right of the one who was a charming believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a kind spirit, a lifesaving spirit.
I see his eyes staring at me.
My mother died 15 years ago.
Dead after I talked to the phone.
I am passing through all stages: misunderstanding, anger, pain, tears that come out alone, wherever, at any time, in the insolent places, at any time.
Then time passed.
There's no need for him, no answer, no answer, no need for him to trust me, to comfort me at the heart of his sweetness.
However, she's there, quiet presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his eyes worrying about me, I see the tears that admire his gaze, the cuts around the lips that believe in cigarettes, the more that mark the face of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looked at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes.
My wife and mother of three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we were little to laugh a little more, and declaring his name is no longer a taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to him in the middle of the night when the absence is too bad, she invites me in my dreams when morality is a bit achieved.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the rest of our time makes us realize how much she was the head of orchestra and we try to stay in the way she's been tracking us.
If a person has loved you very much, the absence can't draw you from your heart and memories.
In some ways, being loved becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't help her fatigue and three weeks after her death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from yours, I always ask if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in a different sense, I don't do it and I always ask what he thinks about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is this genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a little bit like an egg, he didn't need to talk to us.
Bref, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It took about thirty years for my husband to die at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain I then experienced has certainly come to an end, but it's still near me.
Very often he's "debarking" in my dreams in such a precise way, if living in the wake I'm even more sad to see that it was not just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I said no, he answered, "I'm going down," but with a voice so real that I woke up above, excited and lighted up the headlight looking everywhere, hoping he would come.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I come back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the parts, I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world, I wouldn't leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I have to make it clear that I'm familiar with a matter of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I laugh, I'm a mother, I'm a friend, but my heart and soul belong to him, and I never talk about it with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the most bleeding month since 2008
October was the most murderous month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published this Friday of official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication will take place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noory al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what's happening in Iraq isn't settled, it's going to expand, and what's happening in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a live terrorism virus spreads?
Noury al-Maliki spoke to the U.S. Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They would fire the accused, among others, to be a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug dealer of a police investigation was imprisoned.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Assets.
A large defence lawyer, who had reported a drug addict to an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction was not revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarbrough regarding his drug-related investigations after he committed himself because of his habit of cocaine consumption.
The lawyer, who was named "Bash" and considered criminals to be a "primary file", was arrested in 2011 following police hearing operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers named Sarborough, 32 years old, while depositing three cocaine bags at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while visiting a barreau dinner with confres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this Class A drug after tests showed cocaine traces in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain information illegally on the arrest of two men for the account of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored by the police at the time as part of an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the county of Lancashire, Cumbra, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police took heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 M, as well as over $200,000 in species during a series of rabies.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he was afraid that his drug habit would not be revealed on the big day.
Today, at Liverpool, Ditita, who works at the Forbes Solicitors lawyers' office in Blackburn, was disappointed after having been found guilty of two heads of prosecution of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police investigating Scarborough discovered that he had been regularly in contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and reported him arriving at the house of Ditta and placing the drug, 60 per cent below the village of the lawyer in a black golf gang.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the foot station of Ewood Park, the founder of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned to him, discovered the drug, and called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her head, on her wallet and credit cards.
Dita was arrested later but did not consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the drug dealer who was alleged to be his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta grabbed his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all caught and a hair sample was taken.
In a questionnaire, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that he had been called by customers for legal matters.
However, the court heard evidence that he called for major drug dealers, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were currently doing.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know he doesn't have to violate the law, he's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer and of being too involved with particular customers.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will certainly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this is far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He stopped the police investigation as long as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disappointed him.
He was too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he had to compromise his independence.
"If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lieutenant Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has been a criminal lawyer himself since he began drug trafficking with criminal organizations."
Its addition to cocaine has made it ever and has made it vulnerable to the thinking of members of organized criminal groups responsible for obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta put this trust and tried to open up behind the varnish of his profession.
The unit responsible for the serious and organized crime of Lancashire conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was recognized as guilty of three cocaine charges and now through justice, bearing witness to his commitment to the continuation of criminal justice.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you to the courts.
Scarborough himself has been imprisoned for 14 years after he has repeatedly complained about the complexity of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/responses about himself during which he said his dream job would be a lawyer to represent customers in the death cycle in America, his last dinner invitation would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.

The classic song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school client who will be targeted, an initiative that has been well-known during the previous season.
Through five sessions imagined and interpreted by the artists of the region, vineyards with a strong dose of humor, young people are allowed to enjoy classical music.
In addition to this show, the Lyric Art Society of the Kingdom will come back with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now serves as a living room for the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
In these activities, the Lyric Apero was added, the concert-beneficiary held in August last, with the competition of the soprano coloring Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as an air of La Key-Souris.
Without providing specific figures, the president of the board of administration, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to show his surprise.
Despite the pre-carnation that is the lot of such cultural institutions, the future is well designed, even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant support.
"The funds are floating and we hope to endure until the 50th anniversary of the operation, a step that we will break in seven years," the administrator commented.

Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court Friday.
New collective appeal against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new collective appeal was filed against the brothers of Sainte-Croix regarding sexual assaults that would occur this time in the office of St. Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the witness of the applicant, identified as "J.J.", which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first to Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the office of St. Joseph, where he was serving as a carpenter and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only intended for three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said, "I, I was in such a place, can I be registered?" said lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has in particular allowed for the addition of complainants from any institution where assistance could be provided by members of the Sante-Croix Congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the brothers of Sainte-Croix.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the Oratorium of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, has "allowed that sexual intercourse be perfected against children", that they have "performed a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they have "in the course of perfect sexual acts and have yet to meet them", and that they have "studently and knowingly chosen to ignore the problem".
These last accusations are based among others on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research in the archives by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the cases.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once accepted by the Court, the hearings on the ground are held at the second stage.
In the case of the first appeal, the Sainte-Croix Congregation had agreed to regulate the friendly before hearings were conducted on the ground.
Importing fire in a trade
A fire has severely damaged a trade in LaSalle's arrondissement in Montreal on Friday night.
The rescues were called to 1h, Friday, due to a fire that was declared on the floor of an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dollar Avenue, near the intersection with the Rjejane Street.
The thirty pumpers who were sent to the places had spent about an hour mastering the brasier.
Fire caused "a significant damage to the structure of the building", said the chief of the fire safety service of Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the pumpers arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty houses, located at the first and second stages of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments could have to be temporarily accommodated, indicated the SIM.
Many opposition to medical help to die at the Palliative Health Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, will be held a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Medical Aid Act in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to cope with their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a Canadian Palliative Care Association spokesman, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasia would be minimal.
The President of the Québec Palliative Care Network also rejected the bill on medical care to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences of the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also head of the home of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless in any way.
We never are asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the draft Quebec Act dissolutes the population with regard to the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario's gonna take the step.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the notion of the end of life should be clarified before the draft law was adopted.
Kenyan press declines from the media dispute law
"It is an exhilarating country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from paying for the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper in reply to the draft law and asking that it be declared constitutional.
"This law is Dragonian and very penal, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – Owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected radio stations and Internet sites in Kenya.
He stated that the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would lead to Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "the power over the media". The Standard stated that in Kenya, democracy and freedom of opinion "had taken a heavy toll" and destroyed the bill as a "draconian".
At the same time, the adoption of the draft law involves a train of measures to strengthen national security in the settlement of the attack by armed Islamists at Westgate's commercial centre in September last.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities by spreading video surveillance cameras on which groups deployed at the scene of the attack were more than the commercial center of luxury.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the summons were withdrawn after a bullfighting in the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be able to be passive to cover up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "red" or of being unable to receive official accreditation.
The court has also the power to seize the property of a opponent if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single measure is enough to parallel most of the FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By reducing media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want at all costs.
“ No one will ever be able to do it, ” wrote Mutuma Mathius, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, the political men would put the country in a trap and put us in the trap and trap."
The Kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the people in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Committee on Salaries and reimbursed their Mirobiliary Salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month, which are among the highest in the world.
A hard year for pharmacists
The launch of nearly 10 pharmaceuticals at the Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval caused a great deal of excitement at the direction of the City-de-la-Santé Hospital, which was held in 2012-2013.
Because of multiple departures, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmaceutical department has found itself very weak in staff.
Nearly 30% of the costs were needed, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSS decided not to engage in independent work, which may cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't take advantage of it, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities have been rationalised or reduced within the establishment to rent, the time that things take place.
Of course, we have worked hard to interest our young people [pharmaceutical residents] so that they can come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this dry period, 2013-2014 is more easily announced for the CSS Pharmacy Department.
Already, three pharmacians are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacies have been married over the past month.
In addition, the efforts made by the Department to maintain results have been made, as the four students currently living in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS.
Now, it's going to be much better, highlighted the pharmaceutical.
By the end of the financial year, we have seven new pharmaceuticals and three maternity returns.
So this will bring together our departures from last year.
Always Growing Needs
However, the situation remains fragile.
Several factors, such as the shortage of patients in hospitals or the prevalence of young women in the metere, make it difficult to predict the situation in 2012.
For us [the number of factors] is always decisive, because we have a young environment and we employ many young women, so with the grandparents, we are always running almost three maternity leaves when it's okay, she added.
In the last year, there was much more and there were no pharmaceuticals available for replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old model top doesn't start its career in cinema by the small door.
Realiser Lars von Trier chose to take Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This Greek pornography drama, in eight chapters, which will appear in two volumes (January 1st and January 8, 2014), is the erotic memories of a quadrennial increase in sex since its teenage years.
The similarity of Stacy Martin with his age is striking: a brandile silhouette, a diaphane tent and the origins of Franco-English.
Not to forget a certain taste of the risk: the one who did not have the ability to put anything on the frozen paper will appear in more sulfate situations on a large screen.
A Nymphomaniac extract has raised the temperature on the Toile: Stacy Martin there appears in bed and full extension with Shia LaBeouf.
If the promoter film asked its actors to put their power on the record, he had used X professionals for the most obese sex scenes, before fusion all the bodies numerically: above the station, it was the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of throwing his actors into their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't just talk about her.
A CGR room in Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following picotations at the throat felt by the viewers.
Immediately, the director of the establishment carried out the evacuation of the room and prevented the pumps for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people were out of the meeting.
The persons were examined, and the room had no full recognition.
Mauvian pleasure on the back of the lacrymogen jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the director of the film has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers.
The room has been aired and everything is in order.
The film was able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
A woman from Halloween tried to enter the country two kilograms of cocaine dissimulated in lemons, Thursday morning, Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It is during the examination of passengers' baggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pre-visible litres.
The drug was then transported to the Canadian Royal Gendarmerie Office (GRC) that took the rest of the investigation.
Canada's Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, the ASFC spokesman.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border officials at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have committed 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border officials in the Quebec area conducted a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Air raids against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered the Lebanese Wednesday airport at the beginning of afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8 cargo of missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
The new outcome of Tsahal's flight in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz) has not been confirmed either by Israel or by Syria.
The rally took place in circumstances that were almost identical to the one on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American officer who had confirmed an Israeli attack on CNN, aimed at this time at Yakhont's soil mission, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their frustration at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forced President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches failure
The standard & Poor's notation agency dropped Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic to meet its financial obligations for more than a year.
The public debt note of the country goes to "B-", which is based on the specific investment category.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, at least one chance at three that it will be again reduced by one year.
"It is less likely that the government's strategy will provide sufficient foreign loans to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. agency explains.
The agency notes that Ukraine's exchange reserves fell by 26 per cent between September 2012 and September 2013 and provides that the trend will continue.
This is complicated by the repayment of foreign credits.
These reservations, to which the authorities have applied massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, deepening, the agency is increasingly likely to consider a devaluation, which would affect its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports in Russia, which is accused of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of live tension with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the following day of publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had risen between July and September, its fifth trimester of contract follow-up.
Its start was relatively modest in recent years and S&P estimated at 33.5 per cent of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budgetary deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months, which had provided it with $15.3 billion in 2010 and has blocked it for only 3.4 billion.
The Fund, however, refuses to provide any new tranche until the country has adopted impotential reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new infringing mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external funding needs" were "a vulnerability", although relevant "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect a short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that impudent reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections were scheduled in 2015, the expert was asked by the AFP.
The only hope is to improve international cohesion.
S&P also refers to the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels provides for the release of opposition Joulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but it could have a short and medium-term negative impact on Russia's response," explained S&P, who fear "commercial restrictions" on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth Ukrainian exports, warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green Fire at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicists and Omnicom said on Friday that they had not received any objection from the American authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger is closer to the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group have announced today the expiry of the period of review of the previously announced merger by the Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," both groups announce in a communication.
They also state that they have received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HR to the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several conditions for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on the acquisition of other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese Army has passed the M23 rebels.
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would pass the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of the North Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of fighting after being expelled from the north-east Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that it had been monitoring since the beginning 20 months ago of the resurrection.
"We will continue the M23 and hide it everywhere because it is criminal," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC.
We don't have to let them reorganize because they've been marrying the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come for peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the premises under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, had stated on the RFI that these military returns would not in any way alter their claims to the peace talks.
These last ones, according to Ugandan media, returned Wednesday to Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23.
Increases are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last place in the hands of the insurgent to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebel saw the day in 2012.
As a result of their support in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of the province of Nord-Kivu, benefiting from the escape of the government's fines and the passiveness of the blue cases of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in RDC, the most important in the world in terms of efficiency, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the majority of the FARDC states have been rehabilitated and the army has been subjected to violence against M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to touch its end," said a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historical - this would be the first time that Kinshasa's government has succeeded in fighting a major surprise.
And this would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the RDC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which does not support the M23 of military support, of becoming the starting point of conservative consuls.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to give evidence of detention, announced a spokesman from the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military hostages following the massacres in Rwandan territory.
Mercredi, the people of Bunagana invaded the bourgeois streets to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived for a year with the M23 and it seemed immeasurable to us to be a day free from the army," testified a resident of this Ugandan bordering area.
"We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized," added the man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He explained that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
Mardi, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of reaching, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already killed 50 people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, made a drop in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production has increased steadily in relation to the group's objectives.
Its net profit of the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per operation, against $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per operation, a year ago.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, increasing by 2,52 million bpj products a year ago.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in the expected production since 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment costs have increased from $7 billion in two years and should reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The benefits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the benefits of the activities under way (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This reduction in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus, Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, has made a net profit in decline, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Elector transport: the complaint received
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the cost of 150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transport to two residences, a service offered by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a media service proposed by the Commission and I was interested," said Ms. Lefèvre.
According to it, the CRS was invited to a mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk, to play and find solutions," Mrs. Lefèvre said.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization simply meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbrogate around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu's emergency
On July 10th, a party of staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, decided to "declare the schedule for implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that could not take place on 4 November".
An official application was made "to avoid any risk of emergency arrest in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed not to generate the PS campaign for a few months in the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial guidelines, the closure should also be effective at this date.
Although the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
On 4 November, the pumpers that provided approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual passengers to the emergency of the Hotel-God will all be received to reduce the thirty serious cases per day to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the interiors.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency-specialized interiors will leave a place on Monday to five general medical facilities.
As regards the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The Hotel-God's emergency reception service must be closed in the shortest time, and it is 4 November for us," says Loïc Capron, president of the APHP Medical Committee (CME), who supports the management project.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients with pumps, only people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an urgent manner, " it is slowing down, estimating the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the ground to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will stay in place, as well.
However, it is up to the ARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"It's happening progressively," replied Nicolas Péju, the ARS spokesman for which, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service done."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," laments urgent doctor Gerald Kierzek.
As a result of his position as Head of the SMUR in July to take the lead against the reorganization project, he was defined as a "warning launch" against a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are in the process of seeing and seeing the emergencies that were renewed less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they're regularly involved.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière's emergencies.
The ARS argues that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent a "valanche" in other emergency services, where human resources will otherwise be strengthened.
The "new hospital model" has already been on the road since 7 October and should continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
From now on at the end of the year, liberal general physicians should also be involved in the establishment of an "ambulatory care continuing".
"Where is it going if people are asked to auto-diagnostics", Gerald Kierzek asks what "the concept of not serious urgency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical reaction".
This will take place as for level 3.
People are not crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the Minister does not take action on Monday, we will change our arm, Christophe Prudhomme, an urgent doctor and a member of the Health CGT.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and will reflect on presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalia Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, counsellor of the 4th round Paris, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of the emergency at the Hotel-Gode, it would be technically and financially impossible to reverse them if they are returned to their responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again reminded her of Monday morning on France Inter that she had been sentenced to a moratorium for not closing on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, note Bruno Juliand, her speech port.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot allow it without an acceptable plan to report to other hospitals.
Obama finished listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to finalize its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, indicating an American official, Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to retake the hand in the case of NASA's hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, who was refugees in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and the World Bank have been monitoring the information agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked about the subject, a U.S. government official replied: "The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance at the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
In expressing himself under the anonymity scheme, the officer did not specify whether such surveillance had been put into place in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be discontinued during the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at the same time that it ended the hearings of the Onu General District in New York.
In this context, the Senate Committee on Information approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but allowed them to continue.
The Commission introduced new restrictions on data that information agencies are authorised to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the preservation of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been put in place 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began to be held in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that it was now time to “overtake national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adapt the process to set universal sustainable development goals (ODD)," he added.
These ODDs will support the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to meet the mandate of the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the WTO.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, founder president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she changed her work clothes against a tee-shirt bearing the mention "We want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the site of the Independence of the Jewish Capital.
For two weeks, there has been virtually every day reports of conflicts between the Government forces and the Renamo, the best progress since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was also a prominent rebel movement, supported by the White Government, then by the Government of the apartheid of South Africa in efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became a party to opposition.
Analysts believe that the country should not resort to an open conflict, but recent events have angered foreign investors and the local population.
The survey is significant for the full growth economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and carbon deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investments over the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, the Brazilian Valley, Eni, Italy and Anadarko.
Frelimo, the party to power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo has been refusing to be responsible for tensions.
The Renamo states that the Government is the source of recent attacks and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Bastion of the Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels were then triggered when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlaka, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The Government renders Renamo responsible for the outbreak of conflicts and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza stated that the French press agency, the French press agency, would consider Mr. Dhlaka as a "lost" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insists that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that the Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness,” said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties failed to meet the tensions that had been fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlaka) who do not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open and specialist university conference in Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would take municipal elections to take place in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as a attempt to obtain concessions and a treasure of war on the part of the Government.
The part of the suffering collected by the Renamo has not ceased since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by an old member of the Renamo, should receive more suffering from the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term – wanted to destroy democracy in the country next year.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has led to some disturbing attacks on police commissions and vehicles on a major North-South highway.
Most of the arrivals took place in the province of Sofala, which is located hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export the coal.
In June Rio could no longer use the railway route for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was very shy when he was asked if the Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things would not go well in Mozambique”, said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations caused by the government, says Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slowdown in development and the recent wave of eviction.
"People think that the country's future leaders are the Government and the President, and that it is the latter to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people wanted only stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
It should teach myths and legends to children as “models of lifestyle”, says the author.
Thor's legend could show that "brutal force does not make the weight of the subtile Russian," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscenities to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "minutely selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it amazing that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been praying for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly educational ” means that children are“ completely distracted, ” the messages are “suppressed ” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author written for adults and an adult author written for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or done well, but there is a sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlined; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The foundation knows what we're showing and what we're not saying.
A fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed this night and another injured by an Israeli war machine in the Gaza Strip, learned medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists carried out a border surveillance operation between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they pulled out an Israeli blind eye.
NSA spying: the United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of spying, recognized State Secretary John Kerry, in this first Polish-full Washington era with Europe on the mass collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandals, revelations and demilitarisation between the United States and their European allies, the first time an American government official explicitly endorses practices that are disputed in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I congratulate you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this will no longer happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London where he has participated since Washington on Thursday 31 October by video link.
In his speech, in the presence of British counterpart William Hague, the head of the American diplomat has long justified information and information collection practices by the necessary anti-terrorist fight and the prevention of potential attacks.
Recalling the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry made sure that the American authorities had already added many pending projects, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings don't explode and people are killed, because we were able to be on top of these projects," the U.S. diplomat argued.
And John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been misled."
But we strive to collect information.
"And yes, in some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate way," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal in a tournament last week in Paris, London and Rome.
On Thursday evening, he made sure that President Obama was "solved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would be misled".
But the controversy between the Americans and the Europeans continued to influence this week with new developments in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted hundreds of millions of users from Google and Yahoo.
The journal, which quotes documents obtained from the former consultant of NASA Edward Snowden, states that the baptized program "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British counterpart of NASA, the GCHQ, allows both agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by Internet genes.
In one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the last month - from metadata on e-mails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interventions would have taken place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have broken all ties with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have widely intercepted data and communications from United States allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European States and while fugitives in the U.S. press claimed that the American President was not in such a hurry, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this issue, calling national security.
On the other hand, the master of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, claimed that his intelligence agency had arrested tens of millions of European citizens.
He even referred the ball to European information services that would be received from these communications before they were provided to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these Otan allies co-operated with the United States, and this would not mean Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the Polynesian was going to be in Asia on Friday.
Indonesia called upon the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission was accused of being used by the Americans in the context of an extensive international spy network that also caused China's air.
The Paris Saint-German will receive Lorient Friday without his master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces League 1 club in a release.
The PSG, leader of the Monaco Championship at the different goals, published the list of players held for this game on the 12th day, without including the 32-year-old attacker.
The communication simply indicates that it is "damaged", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered a left knee inflammation when he returned from his selection, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of cremated deaths
The Crematorium of Father Lachaise organises, at 11 o'clock, a lay ceremony, in memory of all the cremated losses in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris office, must attend and then explain at a press conference her funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsessives, more than more than French choose cremation, instead of inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September in 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsessives of a neighbor, it is the reverse: the French prefer the inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they are unhappy about losing a child, they're only 15% to choose the cream.
In his book The Death in Censorship, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, emphasizes the "violence" that constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence committed to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a bag of ashes" in a very short time, not after a decomposition process, which "would accompany the stages of pain".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which is related to the "excessing of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the anonymat" of the cells.
Why is what is accepted without punishment in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poor in France?
"Because Cremation is a new fact," answered Marie-Frédérique Bacque, president of the Tanathology Society and author of the book Apprivoise death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to accept it.
Acknowledging the Crémation is for François Michaud-Nerard, Director General of the Sanitary Services of the City of Paris, who is also worthy of a ceremony to which he is entitled with inhumation.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a strong attachment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77 per cent of French people want one, for their neighbours, whether religious (53 per cent), or civil (24 per cent).
At present, 73% of the people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or atheists also want it.
Crematoriums are adapted to this development of society.
"For decades, they have tried to avoid family violence, without waiting, for an hour and a half, immediately following the removal of the ashes," observes Mr. Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the institutions now offer ceremony teachers, who, in the presence of the body, attend the following ritual: host the assembly, appoint the deceased, associate others, invoke it, give meaning to his death, organize the evening.
This has been the case with Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony teachers are often people who have become converts.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that since 2010, the Crematorium of Father Lachaise has been organized by La Toussaint, a number of ceremonies of memory, lay and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is re-transmitted inline, to the attention of those who could not move.
The crematorium has allowed us to renegotiate it.
In La Seyne, the settlement for rats turns to polymic
In the beginning of the week, a family left its apartment in the red-twisted out of the Furctidor D2 furniture, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, to assign the couple and their three children to a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took extreme proportions, which was considered by Joel Canapa, the director of the office.
There's always been rats in the cities.
The delatation company takes two steps a year, and in addition, we intervene on our behalf at every request of the inhabitants.
We have done so, since the end of the last winter, 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats don't puke in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, delating products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two races, they will not kill a dog.
"We haven't invited rats at our home," the father of the family who left his apartment to install himself at the hotel.
We are soon without sleep and are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo's Exchange ended in less than 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Forum ended on Friday in spite of good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The quota has fallen from the recovery of the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to the export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
Nikkei's index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and Topix passed 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house with a flame-producing in the Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in the Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than thirty pumps were shipped to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames were declared in a house of three houses divided into four stages behind the Québec Seminary court.
All the tenants were left in the fire.
The fire was operated an hour after the fires arrived, which was many to intervene.
As soon as our first pumpers arrived, they really saw smoke coming.
"Then the alarms did happen, because it took strength to attack the building, because it is buildings gathered here," explained France Loiselle, a spokesman for Quebec's bombers.
An investigation is ongoing to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: New York's tenth anniversary Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where the stand-up was born in America: nearly 100 years ago, the Valudeville actor Frank Fay, who had the role of ceremony teacher at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell lies directly to the public, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of the heads of the show rose to Carolina, and they knew a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", an evening of comedy and music for the benefit of the former combatants, organized in Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took the width, just like the comedy world.
Several of the comedies participating in this year's festival are attended by non-traditional circuits, such as television shows, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cabled chain (The League on the theme of the fantasy football happily left the FXX chain) and now has his own chess show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" broadcast and participated in the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is still more known for her violent video series "Marel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedys with the single voice (the surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the Iranian defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralised world of the American comedy.
One of the main attractions of this year's festival will be entertainment: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television performer, as well as an official story of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he launched a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
Meet him at the Villa Hotel, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comical DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that, when he was here, he sometimes went down a street between two furniture and said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here again."
The oil price continues to decline and is approaching $96 the barrel.
The oil price continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks are offset by a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing industry is developing in electricity.
The U.S. delivery gross price in December dropped from $14,96.24 at the end of the morning in Europe in electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract was lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a drop of 5.8 per cent for the month of October.
The massive supply of raw oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy indicated Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector on Friday, which show an increase in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to recover after growth increased by 7.8 per cent to the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known since two decades in the previous quarter.
The gross Brent, a reference to the international gross already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) barrier in London.
Reimbursement due to the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal re-established in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary abortion which had been blocked by a court of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in this State and giving rise to the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The decision made by the appeal court means that doctors who practice IVG should have a "priority of admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, based on his status as a hospital carer, to allow a patient in a hospital or medical centre to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
VAG advocates claim that the content of the law is likely to be translated by an immediate closure of one third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a first court judge had been deemed to have observed the entry into force of the law that the provisions governing the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional.
However, the Attorney-General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the government's position, called on the court to cancel the trial of the first court which prevented the application of the law.
A full hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a return to power, with audiences, with 1.3 million TV viewers behind their television, or 5.6 per cent of the audience.
But was the show at your meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates were present at the 10th session, to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, why André Manukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, TV viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why is it so disillusionment?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first one.
As every year, the first audition emissions bring a wide range of female singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some have found their accounts there.
They are many to have tempted the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the end.
Behind TV screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others have just the intention of laughing.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD's control and flagship policy
A federal appeal court blocked a decision by a judge calling for changes in the control and background program of the New York Police Department and decided to the file.
The U.S. Appeal Court (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the appeal was filed by the city.
The judge had held in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme aimed at controlling and questioning citizens.
The city called for its conclusions and corrections, including a decision to appoint a controller to assist the police department in modifying its policy and training programme associated with it.
The appeal court heard yesterday arguments concerning the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be critical of the case because it violated the Code of Conduct of the Judges by committing the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part due to a number of complaints given to the media and public statements in which he responded publicly to the court's criticisms.
The judge had stated that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, targeting black and Spanish men and their own origins under their control and flood program.
It has appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in areas where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons whose case was rejected after police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal should take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of control and mobilization have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and dust system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls mainly relating to black and Spanish men.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and became a collective action.
The participants who have made changes in the NIPD control and patrol programme say that they will end wrong practices, allow police forces to be more effective and trusted, and will be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opposers said that these changes would lower police morals without reducing crime, would represent a money-saving and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after the police had been severely reduced during the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the practices of control and noise, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way NYPD carried out its controls.
The tenants have to vote because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the apartment that goes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides the amount between each apartment.
We are obliged to increase the rent to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in town.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us for $100,000 fires, lands of $4 to $5 million for the case where...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for Elysée chef
Entered into the 500 m2 elysene kitchens as commissioned after working in ambasadas, the cook took all the steps until he became the boss, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing by Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacations, and fed an incalculable number of great people in this world in a nearly anonymity that he is currently only breaking at the time of retirement at 60 years.
The man with open face, black garners and intellectual moons, born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is a patriarchal CAP.
His mother was the same cook in a tent in Sologne.
"I've been away from a castle the other one!", ironis Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the ways of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their husbands and some of their exemplary guests.
"He's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," as she had forbidden women in the kitchens of Elysée!
Instead of moving to the heads of state who showed relative indifference to earthly food, "they are all gourmands", Bernard Vaussion is warmly accused.
Jacques Chirac had certain "a little bit more developed."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the fraud, the hostages were alive!
As for François Holland, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal that he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who has recovered the lost kilograms before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime application".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially in the days of state in Elysée: "between 200 and 250 people in an hour should be used".
The night before is almost white.
Those people wouldn't understand there were errors.
The former chief cook of Elysée's kitchen, who took a glass Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, part with a penance in the heart," François Hollande came to greet me."
He told me about the elegance.
"They're on the human side," he said.
The head will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been for his part for seventeen years in Elysée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the projection of the flame in the Vieux-Québec Friday midi.
The building of four houses, located at 15th of the Hebert Street, was designed by three alarms from the fire service.
The fire was declared before, but it was raised on the three steps of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Québec Fire Protection Service, explained that the rapid intervention of pumpers has made it possible to avoid the spread of flame to adjacent buildings, a challenge of size for this sector of the city where buildings are built in a closer manner.
The burned house opened four houses, but no tenant was found in the places at the time of the fire.
The damages were all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the experts have distinguished the subject of a criminal act.
Le Loup de Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets you get some pictures of his next film, whose role is to play, the role of an ambitious new Yorkian court, is taken by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will discover you in his role as a slow trader.

Decades and extremes are the master words of this folk of history.
The Scorse-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The exit of the new Scorsse took the delay due to its too long mounting.
He'd look like the movie would last 2h45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the race for righteousness to the oscars.
Coulson used the phone pyratage to check a tuyau
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone pyratization, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a tweet of a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in exercise, Charles Clarke.
Professor Andrew Edis QC told the court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false room in May 2005 according to which Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "good special advice".
He was notified to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pry Pawlby's vocal box and to "plant constantly before his door", but Coulson also called him and left him vocal messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house waiting to surprise them, is the kind of person to like to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three means to investigate subjects: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is at the turn of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first thing?
Does he know the phone pyratage?
He says otherwise, but we say "Of course you do."
Rumors on a connection involving Clarke were first taken by the editing office of NotW when a source, trying a sexual attraction to Mrs. Pawlby, said to her, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was taken to the home of Multicari in August 2006.
The investigators also found information on the computer of the private detective regarding Ms. Pawlby and her sister listed in a "Projects" file.
During the period during which the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's parents received anonymous calls for information on her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have monitored the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's minors.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett with a relationship with a married woman while he himself had frequented co-defence Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks did not have any plans with others to dial phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Multipliers, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having done telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives the first Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The US President had to receive on Friday, 1 November 2013, the first Iraqi Minister Nouri Al Maliki, in the United States, in a request for help to combat the worst wave of violence for five years.
Iraq became known in October for its most murderous month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people were killed in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are increasingly lethal despite enhanced security measures and military overcrowding operations launched for months by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the whales.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence is alarmed by a new embezzlement, while Syria is in the process of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, museums, weddings and funerals.
Men are beaten in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction with Sunni minority, under the power of Saddam Hussein, who complains of political marginalization and of being the target of unjust arrests, has promoted this scourge of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the following day of the death of at least 26 people in a series of waiting units, including the explosion of five cars in northern Baghdad.
A good part of the violence was imposed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the East (EIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (sunite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of the United States of the First Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in the country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and the Congress elections.
Thursday, he called for the international community to engage in a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance in Iraq is supported by political and democratic senators.
However, the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a poet, who gave him part responsibility for the repetition of violence by his "sectary and authoritarian policy".
They also asked Barack Obama to understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Pekin accuses a group of oysters of the Tiananmen attack
The head of Chinese internal security charged on Friday a group of shadow separatists from Xinjiang to be behind the alert to the parked car, which took five deaths on Tiananmen's place in the centre of Beijing, Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, focused on the crowd on the famous place of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the death penalty in 1989, and took fire by killing three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office on Internal Security, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkey of being the promoter of this attack.
Many oysters, a Turkish minority installed in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkey.
For the Chinese Government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that have been fueled by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing has been organized and premeditated," Meng said on Hong Kong TV.
"The group held in college was the Islamic movement in eastern Turkey," he added, repeating his proposals by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of the origin of the noise and explained that his wife and his mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained filled containers of essence and a cloth with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident hit 42.
The Islamic movement of East Turkey is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey across the world on how parishes manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce, and marriages formed by people of the same sex.
The survey asked participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the ties of marriage.
The survey was sent to each national conference of bishops in mid-October, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope François intends to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States.
A speech from the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in a proper manner to examine the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: Army attacks the last fief of the rebels
M23's unreductives, or hundreds of combatants, were withdrawn almost 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jamba, two locations located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of Nord-Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue in spite of night," said a Jamba resident in the AFP, connected by phone at 12:30 a.m., and said that a girl was injured by a ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the attacks has decreased a little," he added, "it seems as if the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have resisted some of the rebels."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, soldiers had "overnight" in Jomba before joining the front for a "rating operation".
It was very clear behind him of food cuts from small arms.
From Bunagana, the political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion fell to Wednesday, an AFP journalist was able to hear heavy weapons detonation.
According to a source to the United Nations Stabilization Mission of the DRC, the battles were "in a final phase", the FARDCs "instrued the remaining M23 positions to discuss them".
Since the resume, Friday, of the conflicts between the Movement of 23 March (M23) and the army, Monusco has not directly participated in the fighting, but has provided government troops with a firm support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several tens of soldiers, well equipped in ammunition, mounted on the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launch.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, on the bridge with Uganda, civilian-aided soldiers were carrying a multi-rokted launch mounted on a nine-flamming FARDC truck, to ensure the removal of another device plying the M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, once again called on the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" under the penalty of "force" but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without results.
In place, the M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished talking, there remains only Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbal, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without the immediate confirmation of this information from the government side.
The M23 was born in April 2012 of former rebels, mostly Tutsi, who were integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which are opposed to Kigali and Kampala.
Nord-Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the RDC, and its subsolated subsidizes the combined mine resources.
In Bunagana, Uganda's border border, where about 5,000 people fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the DRC that was closed in the morning turned into mid-day.
"Tomorrow we went back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to repeat ourselves," said Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by nine children, including a two-part meal.
We have the impression that the sparks are approaching the peoples.
Early in the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a table on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Musical comedy, this scene
Classics, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, canned and dancing productions take their place.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: music in French claims to be a kind of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame from Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the attempts would stop in the ridiculous.
And the conquerors like Cabaret or the Misery bear the aureole of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Châttelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenarios keep titles like successful tubes.
The first rehearsal, this Christmas, is its excellent My Fair Lady and announces the following world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Belle and the Bed" could be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, music shows such as "1789", "Bastille Amants" and small musical comedys such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" focus on the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Musical Comedy Stories" and a conference at the Theatre of the Châttelet, analyzes the reasons for success if it is lasting.
How does French music come about?
The offer has multiplied.
There are at first the "musical shows" that evolve in the music of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true history as in 1789, the Amants of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year bond under the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the show.
Then there are musical comedies with the suspicious productions of the Châttelet that make us relive the old Broadway gold and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment is popular with English-Saxon musical comedys of diversity by adapting them to French.
Independent French producers try to make a profit.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Rainbow of the Aragine" or "The Spring Level" have a bad effect on funding.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, music comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these metrics in many schools.
The jobs are many among the regional theaters, tournaments, Broadway, the off-road...
The life of talent is also the result of the number of posts to be provided.
Why have the villagers in the province been so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatres go round and it is often the boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Musical shows are missing.
These are the same young people who love telemetry and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the insurance of the neglect of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are certainly held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very awaited when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The Mayonnaise is located in Paris and enjoyed by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms in France in the same way as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the line of Brussels
An accident on the road caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 a.m., on the internal line of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a phantom driver, who is responsible for it.
The ring was closed at 9 a.m. on the scene of the accident, when the road is derailed and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has not caused quite a stir because the accident took place at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The movement was then due to this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction to Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured following an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
Its vital forecast is no longer involved, but it is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Calaeb Pirates".
She was closed to the new order.
RDC: The Army is preparing a new attack
Children play on a carbonized blonde belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba, October 31, 2013, in the East of the RDC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the latest M23 revolts near Bunaga, in the East of the RDC.
The aim is to discuss the M23 of the hills that cover Bunagana.
Here, we've taken the bugina Colline, which covers the Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from itself.
He'll only stay with Runyonynyi's college.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," said North Kivu governor Julien Paluku to the AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to return to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political Fief and the last strong place of the rebellion, this place is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was repatriated by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Since then, a few hundred M23-reductibles have been withdrawn almost 2,000 metres above the farm hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and nearby Jamba.
In Jomba, a resident who had fought all nearby Thursday all day said that the situation was "slow from this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by guards and buried.
One girl was injured by a ball, and three others were injured, including a robbery, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resume of the wars between the FARDC and the rebellion on 25 October, the two Belgians have given no balance to the loss of human life.
NASA's revelations increase the paranoia of companies with regard to State oversight
With a beautiful end day in August, a German police helicopter, the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany, was on the ground.
On the Order of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Information Agency, its mission was to photograph the front of the US post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that BfV is looking forward to identifying the presence of audiences and that the operation has resulted in an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of American Information Services, once again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capacity to "flight the industrial secrets of foreign companies for the account of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their benefits".
However, since Edward Snowden, the consultant has become a complainant, has begun to reveal his inalienable treasurer of information on the secrets of the United States oversight, European governments and business leaders no longer know if the Director is to be trusted by word.
Reports show that the U.S. National Security Agency exposed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US storage service providers in Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, more than ever caused the company's paranoia with regard to State surveillance.
The revelation that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the taste of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between American information services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is reasonable to use these data in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States poses as important a risk as that of China when it comes to industrial and flight data, according to a survey published in July by the EY Board.
However, in all documents published by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Political men have been concerned about the fact that the EU does not have sufficient information and the Internet and that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German parliament member said we should create a German Google.
I can't just close my eyes and slowly rub them...
"This is not the best way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company SAP.
If a strong European IT industry was to be sought, then it was not necessary to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the size and sophistication of American spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock for some companies who thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is being made in cloud information because European officials have been aware that the data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of that jurisdiction and are thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional agency, some 10% of non-American members rejected their plans to use an American storage service provider in the cloud after disclosures on the American Prism data exploration programme.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers today ask us a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data should therefore be kept at all price.
It is not surprising that there is economic tension.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has substantially changed in the context of the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, director general of the BASF Chemicals Production Company.
The Americans are spying on the commercial and industrial level as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the prevention measures they have taken, where this would leave the advantage to an enemy.
Large companies have long pointed forward to the message that is for the least unwise to recover a free USB key at a professional salon or to leave a laptop without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the sound car manufacturer's board, says that the collection of portable telephones before the Council meetings, so that they can't be used as remote hearing devices, is a practice that has been happening for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple portable phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of reaching the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, a large number of SMEs are world leaders in their own ranks.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," warns BfV in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic spy activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States called France, as well as Russia and Israel, to the second degree, to have done economic data piracy acts behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a known German company considered that when it comes to economic spying, "Frenchs are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former French Internal Information Director, the DCRI, stated in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a teenage in Georgia, who died under insolent circumstances, think that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenage girl in Georgia, whose body was found in a rotary battle tape in the gymnasium of her lycée, thought their son had been murdered, declared the lawyer of the Jewish family.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th, in a tape supported at the top of his school gymnasium.
The investigators of the Chief of the London Committee concluded that Johnson had died under insolent circumstances, but the family of a 17-year-old boy replied to these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“ They think that this challenge is all logical, physical laws and common sense, ” adds Crop.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered to the sole purpose of covering the death of their children.
"They sent their son to school with a cardboard and we put him in a dead bag," he added.
U.S. Prosecutor Michael Moore stated Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation on Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to give you the facts where they're going.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was dead by "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he put in place elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do so.
The representative of the sheriff's office in the county of London was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities to submit all video surveillance records that were examined by the investigators.
The parents of the adolescent said that they expected video images to contain indications of the circumstances of their death.
The CDC publishes advice on allergys in children for schools
Mercredi, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage the food allergy of children at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the American Government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergy has been severely reduced.
A 20-year-old in the United States suffers from food allergy today.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergys in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the professional body and the staff of the child's food allergy, and on how to treat them in case of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most widely used – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative meetings of States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something touches my tongue", "I have the impression of having a head on the tongue" or "I have picotetes on the tongue".
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on information
How can you explain the controversial attitude of the French Government, which on one hand is publicly provoked by calling the US Ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the crossing of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the room of his presence on his board by Edward Snowden?
I think there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande phoned Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the United States ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the world's columns a few weeks of interval, on the one hand, the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other, a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a hypocrisy wave on your part?
Journalism is not a moral position, but the search for interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to lose his or her opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the road to analysis by the American diplomat of political issues or others around the world, we consider that this is an important clarification in terms of American power.
When we describe American interference systems against French diplomacy in the United States, this is not the case in order to avoid this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we hide from American collaboration?
The establishment of highly powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States have, in particular, established procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described in part as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah has been reported to the French through the NSA.
France can, for example, be used to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the contrary, it has been said quickly - Americans can provide information to French about other regions of the world.
The question of the background of this matter is, therefore, not the capacity or right of the countries to have interceptual tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, in particular within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the time frame that must be theirs and, finally, the question of freedom seekers.
What are the United States really at risk? A degradation of their image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by the Americans can be doubled.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their State, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have developed.
Another effect can be more economic: more and more European or South American companies demand, in the light of the disclosures, their confidential data to American suppliers submitted to US laws, and therefore to the NSA.
Last element: the broad movement of revelations committed by the media around the world, which contributes to a debate on the monitoring practices of information services so far, could move legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their information services.
Intersexed children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants with ambiguity.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be assigned to them in a strict manner at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare their child’s sex, allowing them to enter a “uncertain” or “not specified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure imposed on the shoulders of parents who could make informed decisions concerning a surgical procedure of sexual reassignment for their nutrition, and to combat discrimination against persons involved.
According to the BBC, one person who was sexually abused would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, contusioned and balafré.
It is estimated that a child of 2,000 born each year is neither a boy nor a daughter.
They are intersexual, the intersexuality that is part of the group of six diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term that designates persons with atypical chromosomes or gondolas (ovarians or testiculars) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been involved.
Sexual identification is not always well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and sex-identification specialist, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
Intersexual children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but that is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to have sex without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science that consists of how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described persons who were intersexual or transgender, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not only that of a man or only that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and is not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics may appear themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, pilosity, poitrin and statue), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of discrimination against persons who were intersexual and transgenic with regard to employment, as well as the scope of acts of harassment and violence and of crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young non-compliance boys now have fields that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to sign male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after having won his appeal trial that authorized him to keep a "unspecific" sex in life.
German passports will contain a third designation by M or F – X for intersexual purposes, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in that country originally signed a petition to remove the “general theory” from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed the German law, writing that "because the world is brought into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of a nurse also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be given to babies at birth.
“The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child’s sex,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodite, according to the name of the Greek magnificent god who had a double sex.
And after a decade, the medical community would consider the type as an ardoise, which can be removed and on which it can be redesigned.
But now many are those who reject the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that doctors can sometimes cheat, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“ In the mid - 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat pregnant children was launched by Dr. John Money, of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the species to be undesirable.
He used the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signs – the way parents learn a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to make it known as male or female sex.
But in one case of 1966, known as "John/John", his theories have given rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut off when he was forced to throw it away completely, also taking the witnesses, and raising him as a daughter.
"Money presented it as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “always repeat this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the Internet's arrival, those who survived these sex-change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result".
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who is born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguistic sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical breakdown of the external body and the witnesses and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he had a vaginal disease.
But depressed and aware that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered frightened him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man, following a testosterone treatment, and his heart was removed.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to standardize the perception of persons involved.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Reported Choice, fearing that the German law "encourages labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their children a "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law would give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third gender call".
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions on a legal nature," she added.
The German law concerns the award of sex at birth.
It's not a battle for young children to go to that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in the Mammographys in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and helping thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law would "response" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete insensitivity syndrome to the Androgens.
Due to the lack of their Androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but not uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married to a child psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or pregnant mothers.
"The law leaves some literacy to parents so they don't have to make critical decisions," Baratz said.
This allows them time to do some tests and to understand them, and a time before they enter "male" or "female".
So everything's fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You do not have to precipitate for surgery that is irreversible.
"This puts children in the heart of the decision and waits for the feeling of anxiety that causes parents because they are afraid not to do what they need," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels most comfortable – and that is something to be ashamed of.
This allows the child to decide for himself.
Letter trusted in the longevity of his Government
The President of the Italian Council, Enrico Letta, believes that his Government will hold until 2015 despite strong tension between the left and right within the coalition to the power of the Senate to vote in favour of Silvio Berlusconi for his mandate.
In an interview in the newspaper La Stampa, the head of the left-wing centre said to "strengthen the intention" to continue to rule with its coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper room of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more enemies than supporters, declares his resignation.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People's Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as he demonstrated his refusal to surrender to the injections of Berlusconi, which he had already wanted to break down the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the American Transport Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire.
Bombers called on the places of the drama claimed that they had responded to a "many injured" appeal.
"The forces of the order are on the ground," explains the airport on his Twitter account, while television images show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a fusion," said AFP a spokesman from the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna will show a person evacuated on a brand card, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at 9 a.m. (12 a.m. in Montreal) airport terminal 3 and also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times state that themes 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately if one of his employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport were suspended.
Israeli Army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza-sces
Israeli chariots killed a Muslim Palestinian soldier of Hamas yesterday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, after learning of sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting in this region had erupted, as Israeli charismatics had broken the border and had been watched by their shootings of Palestinian killers.
The Israeli army was pleased to invoke a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel qualified as a "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, cross-border and where the discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be letting Biden fall for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama were, in the biggest secret, to replace Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event that is in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Dubble Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and told yesterday that the next president's colleagues had carried out "deep work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see whether Biden's exemption could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes went low.
According to the political representative of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign officials and of the House-Blanche, namely the former Secretary-General of the House-Blanche Bill Daley, with a view to measuring the impact of the Vice-President's replacement by former Secretary of State Clinton.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been stored in the Chicago campaign QG and inside the Oval Office.
Only one-half of the president's close advisers – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina and the former counselors at the White House David Axelrod and David Ploffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Dubble Down" indicates that Daley took the lead in replacing Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve the chances of Obama's success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said I had considered a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that the president was not in shape at the time, so we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified for the "concert" review, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested much to find out if the change would be beneficial during the survey.
"The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know whether Obama was on his team to review the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss had been in the course of any repairs.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president "was in the current" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had.
Martin added that Double Down did not definitely answer the question of whether political investigations had occurred at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's exemption from the presidential list had been examined.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
Did you want a flow of ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the medusic world.
Charlie Francis took part in the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light collage.
It was the idea after reading a study of drugs and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recover the bright protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it bright.
Chris explains that, as the ice cream starts to cry when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the smoother it becomes, the more bright it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this trick cost about 200 £."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral pH.
So when your mouth absorbs protein, the pH level increases and the ice is lit.
We tested it in the last months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a brilliant effect.
It's probably the sweetest ice I've ever created because the light of drugs is worth four times the gold.
Each bowl cost me about $140.
But she's pretty good!
The company at Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfumes such as beer, cheese, beef and gold sheet.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It is virtually impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the medus synthesised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was practicing tha chi, revealed his wife, Laurie Anderson, in a letter published by the regional newspaper East Hampton Star and intended for the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died tomorrow morning, while he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st move of tha chi, with his hands of musicians who were blowing the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was the master of this, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's husband also explains that she promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and to take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here these last years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the awesome joy of living that he had," she added.
Lou Reed had a fever last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bunnies, go to bed late and get us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I'm becoming more hunger.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed one good and I would certainly not do it this year.
But the states show I'm the yellow bear when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in bonuses, decorations and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
Derogations should represent 1.2 MD on 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, unanimated sexual objects are burned.
Women no longer need to be sexual professionals; they can also be sexual foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
For men, I look forward to seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I think the Daft Punk space men will be among our photos Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most researched wastes are zombies, Batman, pirates and sorors.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We wiped out our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not alone.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 M in livestock waste this year, according to the NRF.
It's doing a lot of curious dogs in hot dogs.
When it's good, we don't laugh at it.
The Americans will spend $1.9 MD in bonuses this year, according to the Nielsen Cabinet.
This represents some 272 million kg of Hershey bars, suites, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for 41 million children who go to the stock market in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, not tell us stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
The maize beans are the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 well-known well-known houses in the United States, which generate about $500 of recipes, according to America Hauts, and this includes these beautiful photos of you putting on your friend's Facebook and that you can't remove and on which type you really like to leave a comment on the "good head" style.
Finally, we're talking about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were gammas, and sculptured a lemon in the form of oranges, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've done since we've been small.
Fortunately for us, the "birth-citroull trend" has begun only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have sculptured these powers and did not have to sit down.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 M in litres, according to U.S. Census Bureau.
The Lanternal Citroules that slowly float on your home's porcelain are probably from Illinois, where 542 million lemons have been grown this year.
If you are trying to notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathhisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg lemon.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create in-house a stand-alone (bad bank) structure comprising 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure to shut down its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The Bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of the doubt assets in its balance sheet in the coming two years and hopes that it has been fully netized in the three years.
RBS also stated that it would include a provision for the deterioration of additional doubt credits of four to 4.5 billion books per quarter, a writing related to the construction of the canton structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free 10 to 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its ability to borrow.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow a treaty to be drawn up on the past, and the government in particular was accused of joining the RBS management.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a big bank for the client and the UK," said the new Director General Ross McEwan at the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has 6-point back seating and 6-point gardening seats, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options, we include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, director general of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and a realistic access to international events.
We are truly happy to offer such a partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rabies in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for the strengths and realities of rabies.
We had a lot of pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the champion will be really palpitating.”
In addition, Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The pumpers were called to rescue a lost chip after being stuck at 15 m above the ground on an unstable corner in a career.
Ruby, a cocker Spaniard, escaped after an accident on the road without gravity
She was reported three days later by a person walking her dog in the street.
The pumpers come down to remember the length of the falase to recover the dog and save it from a certain death
A shell had the chance to escape to the worst after the pumpers were called to recover it safely while it was dug up at 15 m above the ground on the unstable floor of a falsity.
Ruby, a 9-month cook, escaped after a road accident on Sunday after noon and survived for three days only before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, moved to the Flappit race in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched an appeal on social networking sites after she disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity.
At 2:15 a.m., a person on the right side of his dog was referring to Ruby on a corner in the street, 15 m above the ground.
A technical relief team from the Cleckheaton pumper casserole ran over the places and went down to remember to save Ruby using a bird for animals to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical assistance specialist Andy Clayton stated: "She was in a premature situation."
She was in the middle of the hall, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She did not completely move during rescue – she was frozen.
But she's going well now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's incredible that someone noticed the dog.
Specialist of technical assistance Peter Lau said: "Ruby has had a lot of chance of getting out."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was driven to the veterinarian for control; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exacerbation and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the rescues."
At first, I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him again in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had disappeared, she would probably have fallen.
The pumps were terrible.
What they did was very brave.
They are so well-known, each of them has been absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid she fell but she didn't move."
The pumps were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mike Jagger says he never loved Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio broadcast this week, the pop star said she was choristo on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he pulled me out when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very kind."
In a Jewish statement, 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "has not made progress in Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she is confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tournament this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed in the first place of the charts this week.
Pekin caused a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The support in the coalition is from the Islamic Movement of East Turkey based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security authorities' boss at a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted last night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the political office of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), was in Tachkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese officer appoints a special organization after Monday's waiting.
According to the Chinese police, three Ouijhours of the same Muslim dominant region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, had precipitated their car loaded with guns against the entry of the city to Beijing, in a suicide attack that had resulted in two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of eastern Turkey, former Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations associated with Al-Qaïda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic problems in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's eclination gives the Ecossais a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Ecoss would have to join the European free movement zone in order to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbeled children along the Wall of Hadrian.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper has indicated the economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this would not be included in the great titles (and it was expected).
No one has said that EU Member States spend much of their time around their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer against all that it wants to obtain from Scotland.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dirty account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange London's fight against Brussels, especially now?
This is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Through Europe, parties who oppose the EU or who fight for the adoption of the euro as a common dividend are winning from the ground.
Even in Germany, the alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived at no time, gathered nearly five million votes in the federal elections in September and came out of the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our liberals-democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the draft creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turnaround.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the weighting of national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis is not too great to be seen with national governments that record excessive budgetary deficits – that was only true for Greece.
The European system has rather put its members in favour of exchange rates for German exporters – what German political men want to do.
Without the possibility of an assessment of the national divide, the countries of southern Europe are facing an internal productivity problem in Germany.
The only appeal is to make cuts in public salaries and expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as the United States.
It is an inconsistencies in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's salt gels will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by a well-marketed American skimmed gas.
As a result, the revolution is large, particularly in France, one of the major EU players.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to go wrong.
Result: Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the Socialists to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffering – an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot be based on the principle that a division of right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single and anti-European anti-Money block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are well represented in these elections, as far as possible, such a block could be controlled by the European Parliament for the first time.
That's what I think: very soon, Europe's single anti-European and anti-Montenegro feeling will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will be more similar to the 'European of Nations (Sovereign)' free-of-priority Europe by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could save the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own share.
I look forward to the United Kingdom taking its distances in relation to this project, and I hope that it will make the United States soft eyes.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific makes it clear that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a small region of England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could be able to accommodate a more free European agreement on the condition that we keep our own debt.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scotland SNP government is – and is to note – the best successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it has won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed sombre cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the labour force, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/democratic coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Faster
Studies show that young girls in Africa and Spain tend to reach puberty sooner than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that obsessive epidemics could be a trigger for early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced in boys.
The former CNN representative Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's breasts and breasts begin to grow at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite recent among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time comforting parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” said Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast burgeoning, arms and in the public area and body ovaries, appear earlier in the girls.
But there was only a slight improvement in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, when it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
“ Once the poitrine has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear, ” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”.
Time is the most precise test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate on what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "precious" when the development of poetry is accompanied by a Sudanese growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, slow or stopped development – this is something that a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems such as tumors or coughs.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: early ageing of the os that can slow growth and small sizes of adult age.
The recommendations for medical and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the development rate, the rate of growth and the attractive maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that “the control of puberty can cause some behavioral problems and feelings for young girls to be different from others.”
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle health issues," Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose first rules were made when she was 10 years old.
Although there were signs and we talked about rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She has come back from the frozen school and troubled to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories that have led to public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or the sexual messages generated by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study of girls between the ages of 6 and 9 who placed the percentage of fat mass at the beginning of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influences.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty sooner than white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by all, economic conditions in the climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger public area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced in girls as well.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic pools is current, even in foods and babies.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice on how to communicate with their children.
“ This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned, ” Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will respond in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that even when this happens earlier than planned, the process is part of life.
Humanity to the People of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen brothers, the Grand Price of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and playful film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that began to resonate before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film came to be a retrospective of the French cinema, had celebrated the Cannes Golden Palm in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In default of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen, they threw their debate on the U.S. movie star, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs interpreted directly, Oscar Isaac reveals a performer and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagion.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich surroundings of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less exciting clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the jury owes to the medal when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" describes one week the suffering of a folk singer who is not able to hunt and swim with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements to the feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documenter's air
"His relationship with success has been tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of evils, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist, but integrates, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, co-founded with his brother Joel of several Oscars and price in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two fans of folk music built their story about real characters of the time like the folk folk Dave Von Runk.
The idea was to show the moment prior to the arrival of Greenwich village, this New York district called to become "the center of the show of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film is then taken from documentary halls, of the 33T-invasive pussier music label invented by an elderly secretary, the music choice of contemporary studios and the coffees where singers were produced.
Brother Coen's magic still works by integrating a role of character that goes through the film constantly: a great red chat at the cracking glance, a lucky companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his personality, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had remembered that he had "greatly grown in Tennessee, washed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good", "hasard can also start the career of someone", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let anything stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He would never have known the word quoted.
The French edition phenomenon, Gérard de Villiers, who died yesterday at the age of 83, was quite right to publish its 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, New York Times appointed it as "the author of spying novels who knew too much."
He then spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of 198 and 199 of the famous series of spying novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved during this journey with a decombatant.
And before Afghanistan, it was also divided into Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, would avoid the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, there was almost a half century ago.
"There's no doubt between 120 million and 150 million people in all countries," he said last March.
His burman chat on the knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of the Foch Avenue on two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he mentioned some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, drawing a pile of books on the bottom table between the bronzes or the wires of the 130 countries that are burning to place their novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional coverage with the photo of a young woman in the prosperous poitrine, carrying a gun or a rifle.
On the inside, his senior sergeant, Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat and aristocracy of the CIA to pay for the repairs to the family castle, starts at the tops of all the earth's evils, communists of the 70s and 80s, and from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a six of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," explained Gerard de Villiers.
I consider myself an accountant who writes to distract people I don't send messages to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters of Albert Londons, who went on their way and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS' father said "make a kind of geopolitical sheet".
"I'm in constant custody of my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," said Gérard de Villiers.
On top of that, I met journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some 20 or 30 years.
At the same time, many of its SASs are often premonitious: thus, a month before the attack of a command centre of the Syrian regime that killed several high officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damas".
In the "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to discover the existence of a CIA secret control centre in this city, Berceau of the Lebanese Revolution.
In 1980, he recorded the murder of Egypt's President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Colot du Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the 4X4 Jihadists columns based on the Malian capital.
I'm not going to come, Gerard de Villiers defends, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, in time, some of my hypotheses are realized.
After these trips in troubled areas, he was installed within a month of his machine to write IBM to Marguerite since 1976 "and all the parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in style.
At the walls of his office are surrounded by AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photo of the author with African warlords.
Regularly inspired by feminist links and racism by human rights organizations, Gerard de Villiers dismissed these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I've always been very welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gerard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He's not gonna die and he's not going back.
No more than me.
Airplanes are concerned about the width of seats while large orders are in play
The debate is one of the main air constructioners on the wide range of the tourist class seats on long-time flights, opening the way to an intense confrontation at the Dubai Air Station, which took place this month.
The conflict concerns the range of seats proposed on long-term flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most shortest for airlines, but for which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the Aeronautics industry to set up a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major American rival Boeing states that this should be the company's decision.
The dispute was resolved while the aircraft were seeking to sell even larger versions of their long-distance motor aircraft, hoping for a record of orders during the event to take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be available behind the plane – in particular there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that his modified "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 18 large-scale seats in ranked nine.
Aeronautic genes often exchange cuts on technical issues by advertising in professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Airport, where 777X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently been able to account for what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of a photo of three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Do you accept this?.”
"Boeing offers long-recorded flights in tighter seats than in regional turbo-propulsors aircraft," said John Leahy, the commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-time travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health data.
The average American market size of the twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival approaches to a headquarters concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the conference of the newly baptized "jet seven" device was closer.
Airbus added that it had ordered a study indicating that an additional drop in the seat width would improve the quality of the room by 53 per cent.
Boeing argues with Airbus's figures on the width of seats and claims that this is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the experience in the cabin depends not only on the width of the seats.
"It is really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of the satisfaction of passengers at Boeing.
They don't want us to tell them what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more likely to have some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is more a question that could affect their results.
Following the debate, a course of aircraft orders is closed for an estimated amount of at least $700 Md at market price in the coming decades, sufficient to balance American and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between all the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest long-recorded motor model 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model set in 9.
The unit costs gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats currently in service.
"Boeing does this to allow more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passager at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing suggest that many passengers arrive in favour of a more denser configuration, which can go along with less expensive rates.
"A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the proposal of Airbus is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert inside the cabins of Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but they offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines have to choose.
Air traffic vendors who travel around the world also carry with them a meter to check the competitive settings.
While trying to offer comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer planes with high-density settings to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater passengerization of cabins by offering wider seats on some of his planes.
Without the support of another major manufacturer of large modern devices, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft industry to establish a standard of size for busy seats could be forgotten by 777X.
Oracle's shareholders are upset by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle's shareholders voted against the proposal for remuneration for Founder and Director General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it has drawn the picture of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune, just golden out of the victory of his boat at the Americas Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted against her remuneration.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 year in May due to the group's bad performance, which had lost its growth goals, but he realized about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
At the end of the 2013 financial year, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5%, while the Bourse course was 27.5%, completing the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
One single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the lives of nicotine-dependent rats.
Other tests are necessary before the human being tests begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, despite all the methods currently available on the market, but find that their addition is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an indefensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary for the design of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected with liver cells, which then starts producing a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodys trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents smoking from having its nicotine dose.
In the tests, the vaccines to which nicotine was subsequently administered continued their activity normally.
But the rats who had not been vaccinated "were in love," said the researchers, indicating that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous vaccines against tobacco have become ineffective because they contain antibodies.
The injections should be repeated so often that the antibodies levels remain too high that they were too honorable and low in practice.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into anti-body tools.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addition to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not take any pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but indicated that more extensive research was needed.
The head of Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a strike of an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
However, those responsible for the information, the army and the movement of activists have stated this time that he had lost his life in this battle, which took place in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The guard, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, moved to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been undertaken with the Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of Pakistani Taliban.
Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New Wales of South Joe Tripodi will conduct an investigation of the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former South-South Minister of New Wales, Joe Tripodi, has failed to change the trade policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the area controlled by the government.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had pressed several ministers of the State to renew his baths in Circular Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee, after their opening in August 2005, without having to call for tenders.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was in the interest of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary-General, Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that took place in 2005, the Government had pressureed the Netherlands to make an appeal for tenders.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the leases for the companies of Circular Quay, which reported to Obeid about $2.5 m per year, were renewed without any tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was in favour of tenders.
However, he had not changed his policy at Mr. Obeid's request, which, in recognition of Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on VAT.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICC revealed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of the Ports after working under the orders of M. Obeid to the Ministry of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of trade-related policy?" asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“ No, ” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we were talking about, but anyway, that wasn't it.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeted Syria, declaring one responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The defendant did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air raids against missiles in Syria.
Foreign workers with a visa 457 might have to pass an "authority" test.
The Government is currently considering the possibility of introducing a "authority test" for foreign workers with a visa 457 while considering extending the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criterion designed to prevent visas 457 from being used to handle unqualified posts or as a means to bring his or her family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper has been issued today while working Member Maxine McKew has announced the government talk on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The failure statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the file" and "employments for Australians" are a disastrous return at the time when trade unions called for a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region view it as a result of this historic artifact.
The working paper was made of 12 measures previously envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the proposed changes, the others being under review.
If the "authentication" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be controlled to know "if the employment offer is authentic in the case of a personal relationship or association of the owner or of the person concerned within the undertaking which sponsors it".
Companies may also have to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, with the intention of sponsoring a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum applicant would be killed by a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum applicants on Christmas Island this week.
The disabled son of a nine-year-old man went to Australia with him and found some comfort from the death of his father Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred suddenly by the Australian authorities to the Christmas hospital, where he was killed.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will continue from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Baroness Transport Kramer stated that the project would "conven the United Kingdom".
Minister of Transport, Keith Brown said "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will take on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will be served by Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England, ranging from 32.7 Md to 42.6 Md.
The British Government, speaking with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the track length for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of three-hour travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Baroness Kramer stated: "Our goal for HS2 is on a truly national network that will approach the United Kingdom and its cities."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it offers are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing the connectivity between 18 big British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called Mr Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic advantages to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight in the global high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine the options to generate the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
"I am eager to read the review report with the British ministers next year, and we will then decide together on the next steps."
Rules relating to the use of electronic equipment on board remain for the current moment in Australia
Australian passengers will need to continue to expand their tablets and smartphones during the landing and landing of the United States in spite of the United States management to implement the regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "air".
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during landing and landing.
Australian transporters examined the decision which forced American carriers to carry out an important work in order to comply with the requirements, but indicated that they did not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it examined the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation which obliges aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety signals provided by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA of his intention to extend the use of his on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes," said a spokesman.
Kandas stated that she was currently respecting the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during deceleration and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAO decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will shortly consider the decision of FAO and its reasons.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to the other and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review of manuals, training equipment, handbags transport programmes, and signs provided to passengers.
“Since an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use light electronic portable devices, such as tablets, electronic books readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” said FAO.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to extend their equipment during landing.
The Group also recommended that the heavier devices be placed safely under seating or upper compartments during deceleration and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent bagar
The small village of Pia has known an unusual overcrowded Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crew of 30 people according to the evidence gathered...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was occupied by the Pia side where a line involving several people appeared on the Post side.
At least four minor injuries should be depleted.
Alertly, the gendarmes have made themselves available to separate the belligerants and to ensure that the wounded are taken into custody.
Singapore's gay lenders benefit from medium classes that are forced to close the cement.
Janani Amirthalinga, at the shopping center of Bendemeer, Singapore, deposited a bracelet, a bag and a pair of gold-pounds to pay the school fees of his daughters.
"My husband and I come to buy a house, so all my money is part of it," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she received $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is similar in some parts of South-East Asia – where household destruction is increasing – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, has become the third Gage loan company to be introduced to the Singapore branch this week.
Taking stock of goods is not only a fast means of obtaining liquid money – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as good as a market as bank loans are not guaranteed.
In general, Singapore's cash lenders take an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above 15.4% offered by the U.S. Overseas Bank, a local fund buyer with a subsidiary in the same commercial centre.
However, cash lenders have the advantage of not requesting solvency verification or proof of salary, and they can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to gay employers, while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of life and the overcrowding of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit fed by a excessive monetary policy in advanced economies, low and medium-income families turn to gay employers to bridge the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's notation agency mentioned the growing decline in households, mainly from the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had recorded the ratio of domestic gross domestic production in Asia.
Malaysia is on the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
The economists also fear the high level of consumer recognition in Thailand, which is due to a technical recession this week.
Thursday, data showed a continuous decline in exports and slowing down consumer demand.
"The balance is that with the rise in costs, people in the middle or below [of the salary scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made people feel compelled to ignore their personal effects in order to touch the value of their habitats.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the goods placed in the 200 state-owned loan shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, we'll put the chain in gold and we'll go back to look for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest loan firm, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using their wallets over the last months.
The increase is similar in the gas loan sector as ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like it in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its general director.
The company will finance them using 60 per cent of Singapore's 66 M dollars this week when it was introduced to Singapore.
While some low-rate lenders have rejected criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that gender-based placement not only offers higher rates than other employers, but also does not increase the debt directly.
"Client customers are assuming the assets they already own, and the fact that their personal property is money does not increase household income," she says.
Getting married is better socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
The people who come into debt loans are no longer just those who have financial problems.
The people who live in Singapore will also go to the ValueMax gift loan shops to place gold rings or Rolex displays, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in species.
We see customers from all sides of society.
"This may be easy people who need short-term employment for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses who have a need for treasure in order to pass a difficult head," said Mr. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who was dealing with young people in the Halifax region in Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council's office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was in office, is said to be deeply impressed by this new one.
In a communiqué, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 or access to the Internet.
He compared him to a provincial court in Halifax in December.
It becomes a Nazi uniform in the supermarket, before being thrown
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform wearing a brassard with the cross-platform was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers crying to the head of the establishment called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a speech from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to withdraw, but "the time it comes, it was already partless," she added.
I was laughing when I saw a woman who seemed confused.
People were good mouth.
"You don't go out in the street unless you want to attract attention," said a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, in Cambridge News.
This incident took place Thursday, the day of Halloween, where it is customary to go to monsters, but it was hard to know if it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed the responsibility of this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I wear a black SS brassard twice a week from three years ago at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
Tasmanie's 325-M Rescue Plan for the Health System
The federal government maintains that the 325 MM rescue plan for the vaccinating health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the Government will not spend the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "sustaining measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island's population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system's constraints.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, we believe, will address the unique difficulties faced by the State," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325 M plan includes a 31 M campaign for non-required surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to reduce delays.
Funds are also provided for clinics without consulting Hobart and Lanceston, better external care, medical training, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first line clinics, it is the best way to care for Tasmania's health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict reporting and accounting system.
The State will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive the money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 M will not be large-scale " unless they have been followed by a genuine reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania".
Nevertheless, he welcomed the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these non-required additional procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "fortunate solution".
"The reason why we are here is that the state's labouring government has withdrawn $430 from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300, and pretends it's a tough day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is marked by a remarkable artistic direction and a minute restoration of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
While in France in the 1760s, she relates the historical shadow of Suzanne, a young aristocrat who was sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unbelievably barrenness of a surrogate mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film is never presented in lubricity or sentimentalism, and this is the problem.
The conscientious objectivity of the narrative could also become a prison for the public.
Syria destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, declaring the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, declared the international monitoring body of Jewish chemical weapons, while violent attacks were taking place in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents were supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian soldiers also reported that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) was made with a date of advance on the date of the
1 November established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "imuse" all chemical weapons production units and machinery intended to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious calendar to destroy the chemical weapons of Damas from mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damas still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and chemicals, including gas and neurotoxic agents.
The announcement was made when the fighting took place on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, opened a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of combatants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of soldiers based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah soldiers.
Of the deaths, 2,202 were also estimated to have been deserters and some 5,375 combatants of the opposition, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops fight against the rebels, many of which are linked to Al-Qaïda network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not specify.
The battles highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors while they had to complete their mission, which was to disarm Syria from its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that would be lost in time.
An OIAC statement, which worked closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was now “satisfied to control – and see destruction – all the critical production and machinery for blending and filling”.
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the moment".
Earlier this week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damas.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the IIAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "repatriated and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know for the first time whether Safira unit was one of the two sites that IIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan of destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the IOAC Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you all have demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the IIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war mainly contradicts the Sunni Muslim rebels to the Government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaouite sect, a branch of the Chilean Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion of Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
The anger caused by the punishment against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and close relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the punishment imposed against the last conspirators to be translated into justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a pilot of execution.
Patek, who was almost 10 years old when he was one of the most researched men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks.
It could be released for 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was recognized as guilty of mass murder for attacks involving two night shifts in the village of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injuries.
He was also recognized as guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of alarms aimed at churches throughout Indonesia at Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a penalty of eternal detention, but they could have asked that the man, qualified as "Demolitation Man" for his reputation as expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision saved the memory of June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-olds, Jane and Jenny in the destructions of Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the side of the tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same way as the other men.
"He should be trained in front of the execution bat," said Mrs. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other kids, not seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an external fireplace, exploded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze pulled a bag of two-loaded explosives 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into the coma the next day of waiting and remained unconscious for a month, and he was “dead” three times when he was under spiritual assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before others.
Keep him alive, so there's no reason to keep him alive.
Twenty years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not very much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be translated into justice.
He had managed to avoid being arrested for nearly 10 years, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former chief of Al-Qaïda, Ossama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent reported that reports of information services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet well Laden in order to restore links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaïda.
"He didn't do it," said Mrs. Corteen.
Until recently, he had been deeply moved by the pain he had caused to others.
The summit was held at the 10th anniversary of the events that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be plenty of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek, however, may appeal to this condemnation.
FAO: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not pass a call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the very new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, said FAO administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will need to prove to FAO that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on the installation of devices to be in compliance.
FAO stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already submitted plans.
“In accordance with the plan, we could approve the wide use of electronic devices very soon,” stated FAO in a statement.
Currently, passengers must extend their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the airport doors are closed.
They were not allowed to light the lights before the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green fire.
Passengers are supposed to extend their aircraft at the bottom of the plane before landing and do not light them until the aircraft is installed.
Under new directives, air carriers whose aircraft are correctly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during landings, landings and ground traffic, FAO stated.
Most of the new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenants, has said happy about these changes.
“ Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with transporters for it – this will be beneficial to the whole world,” explained Glading in a statement.
We are clearly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
However, it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to monitor, exchange e-mails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency has declared.
Passengers should put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So not always with Words With Friends, the online style game Scrabble played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out of a American Airlines plane after refusing to extend his device while the device was locked at the door.
And the heavier devices like portable computers should always be arranged because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board mobile phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power for portable telephones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAO.
FAO may impose a ban on certain electronic devices during deceleration and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Board, a national safety expert on CBS News, stated that portable phones were always considered to be a risk.
"Telephones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interactions with navigation instruments, but because we know that according to the FCC, they could disrupt mobile telephone antennas if they were used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by FAO to address the problem recommended that the Government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAO has increased over the past few years to supplement restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., support that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or do so deliberately.
FAO began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New line planes depend much more on electrical systems than previous aircraft generations, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by FAO.
Air companies allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi for cross-country altitudes for several years.
The modified aircraft to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also resist better interferences.
The vast majority of line planes should allow greater use of electronic devices under new guidelines, Huerta said.
Electronic devices today generally emits much less power than previous generation of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when one page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when devices send money or send data.
Amazon.com is a part of those who are pressureing to supplement restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s leaders carried a line plane of readers of Kindle’s electronic books and made it available to see if there were any problems, but there was no one there.
This inspired the members of the FAO Advisory Committee on Mixed Feelings on the issue of whether or not the use of devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought the interferences from devices were real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there is only anecdotic reports of pilots indicating that devices can interact with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAO allow pilots to request passengers to extend their equipment during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them well-meaning arrangements for skilled travelrs.
"We are pleased that FAO recognizes that a pleasant passage experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicoptered bird of a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helicoptered after being exposed to a oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The water line was mounted on a helicopter headed by Aberdeen the last month before being handed over by the Ecossai SPCA in its salvation centre of Alloa.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water line was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhilarated bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “It was impossible to call again, so we were contacted to provide our help.”
The water flow was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business campaign for Britain was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what rich and job makers want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
In order to do so, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive investigation with British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, companies and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing as the EU states grow.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to focus on the long and long process of reform of European institutional archives.
When asked for their opinion on specific political points – from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – most business leaders think that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has experienced a general dissatisfaction, which states that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits it has to share in the European trading area – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are also in agreement.
Finally, and what is more to be said, our survey with business leaders revealed that an important majority wanted to see Britain continue its initiatives for a change in the Treaty and development of a trade-based EU relationship rather than policy.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that renders power to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – changing the Treaty and better representing the interests of Britain would allow for a 16% reduction in the vote in favour of the country's maintenance in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and more necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is engaged in a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, this means refocusing trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
The United States of America with Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not deviate from Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed franchises to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivals on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of the Sandy Ouragan.
So this year, the parties have withdrawn.
In New York, thousands of people have participated in the parade organized in the Greenwich village district.
Everyone is excited, reports one of the participants, Andrea.
Me, I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're acting like fools, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated in the Tussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that the gas pipeline of Bulgaria is opening a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gaza Strip, Europe's largest-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a Jewish statement.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should be able to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual difference between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country through which most Russian gas is transited to Europe, increases the risk level in relation to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are permanently eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is implemented in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries at the end of the year.
The gasduc was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday The New Tahiti News, including information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, on the midway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinies of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English sea that takes place in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few tens of residents, mostly descendants of the Bounty Mutants, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95 per cent of London's generosity.
The Council of the Islands voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2, corresponding to its exclusive economic area.
An assistant to the mayor of the island is going to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, who lives in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, however, provided that they have the means to ensure surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, near Pitcairn.

Prison for an Ancient Chinese Deputy Governor
An old deputy governor of the province of Jilin, in northern China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million young women of women, reports Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and managers to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first Intermediate Court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took his office in March last year, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intrepid with the powerful "tigres" as well as with the "mixes" - the subcontractors - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, among them the former frameworks of the Petrochina oil gendarmerie.
The most spectacular case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xila, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after viewing the highest functions within the State.
However, the Government has never expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Two employees of the YMCA accused of sexual aggression following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing by the Royal Commission.
Two employees from the South New Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the teacher of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that "he had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression on children within his organization".
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned on two matters: an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography and a physical education monitor of YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assaults on children in the centre he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, Counsellor to the Commission that he had knowledge of the first case but that he was not in the course of the second case.
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was inaccurate, "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It has been shown to the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst appreciation of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management had been a mistake with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violation of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced to sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's deficiencies to children's safety.
The staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that he kept them seated on his knees, that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was a member of Lord and who had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found that she was responsible for services for the children of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would be “very scary and difficult to approach most of the time”.
The Director-General said he rejected the evidence of staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had broken their judgment, which made them not aware of their actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his views before the South South New Wales YMCA Council saying that, for the organization, the lessons learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "the signal" by the staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to the staff shortly after the allegations had been made was made by the Director-General of the YMCA for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was a "excessive of zeal" and that it had not been implemented.
The South New Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, by Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "severe problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister, but recognized that his return was unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, 59-year-old man made himself aware of his views on various national policies.
Since its beginning in June 2007, after a decade at the country's head, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and the role of the Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's post, Mr. Blair would have answered, according to London's Standard Evening: "Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so..."
When many experts in these events met in Cardiff to face and overcome the Cheval trophy of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet at school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the pet and his Shetland Toffee ponie were proud during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the south-west centre of Sunnybank, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Faced with men and women in elegant melon hats, he carried his coat jacket a bit on the side of the decoded way to expose his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was welcomed by the judges for his unusual natural qualities of dress for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton was gifted to Toffe for his 3rd anniversary in March and was trained from his Shetland poney every day.
His mother, 30-year-old Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffee are doing a great job."
They presented themselves against and against all, but the two of them crushed the golden cut and the rose.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were so happy that he got it.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so famous that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This young man, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the southern part of Wales, follows the tracks of his numerous Sharon Howells, who has been participating in summer competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and praised it."
He spent the entire length of the track running and even though it seemed to be all small, he did a great job.
Fenton is a dog of animals – he worships horses, tractors and the rural world and has two wings that he cares about.
From the way he started, he will soon participate in the annual Cheval event – and I am sure he will make a great performance.
"Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're forming a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and how they stood on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the dresser – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he had a really nice ride.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a “will be repaired ”
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of a convicted diffamation journalist will be removed, stating a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted inputs to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will come up with a “complete repair”, said the regulator.
The "remand" order consists of the administration of Guangdon for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary survey showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on Zoomlion County Company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express edition was disorganized,” said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card”.
He also "commanded the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake complete New Express repairs, and recommended that it conduct an investigation on the persons responsible for New Express and immediately conduct the newspaper management team".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the supposed financial irregularities of a singer called Zoomlon.
After his arrest, his journal published two times a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
"In this case, I went to Zoomlion as well as to the media industry and its ability to build public confidence," he said to the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I've made my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not verified his articles correctly.
Several important suspects have recently made television sets.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to make their own decisions, despite a change in the law which was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to commit suicide.
The Charles-de-Galle airport in "invisibility"
In Toulon, the airport is in sight.
The explosion of radioactive steam detected on one of Charles-de-Galle's two nuclear heaters in mid-October and when the ship was in the sea, it was "safe for the seas", but not without consequences for the Marine.
The Royale has come to confirm the "invisibility" of the ship until "the mid-November", "the time to take corrective measures that are imposed" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a defence vessel specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, which are deployed in the Var for the occasion, "are currently operating on the airport".
It is for them, among others, to change a pump on the failing heat.
"All has been implemented to enable Charles-de-Galle to do its planned deployment by the end of 2013, however, DCNS explains.
And the National Marine to ensure that "the ship's programme of activity does not give rise to nuclear proliferation."
We recall that Charles-de-Galle's airport ended in a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had set up Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young chess pilots.
A "alarmed petite", which is around the reactor's boundary space, was then produced on the amicral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, I have also been finding a great dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: a demonstration of their property reassessment, tax exemption, the cost of all kinds of permits, administrative costs not to end.
Bref, syphony without limits from our little ones.
Millions of dollars could be saved in order to make a much respectable tax on those who pay.
All money taken out of force on taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their discovery.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, there is no doubt about the total expenditure and the maintenance of bottlenecks: weak cultural centre, strong subsidies to the Energy City, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to the private company or they are disposed of.
It is also worth noting the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a larger industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention of the transformation of old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
This is not for public investment in such enterprises, but for the private sector based on consumer demand.
The citizens were happy to learn that lakes in the Fisheries and the Piles will continue to provide the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline of the population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without saying about the gaspller, the city will never lack water and strict regulation as to its use may be very appropriate.
In summary, it is easy to realize great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a style without passing through an improvisation regulation.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by pregnant women with beautiful diplomas for most of them, and I don't think that a hair lifter is worse.
Discovering a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The American authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet per 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever seen.
The tunnel, measuring at a length equivalent to about six long football fields, is connected to warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, and the United States.
The area is reinforced with indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to dissipate drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were taken out of sight, the authorities said.
The authorities took 8,5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to the judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to ten years in prison to eternal imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drain channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered following the Marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus making a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of some 700 yards equipped with iron roads that shared the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two stores in San Diego.
British police deliver an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police have today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Embassy of Ecuador in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "response notice" against Australia for 40 years, asking him to submit to a police commission, adding that if he did not, he might have been arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following the allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he questioned against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking for political asylum in South America.
Scotland Yard "has delivered a notice of resignation to a 40-year-old man who asks him to submit himself to a police commission, at the date and time of his election," said a spokesman.
It continues to violate the conditions of its release under appeal.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the opinion by the police.
Assange is afraid to be taken from Sweden to the United States where he may be accused of spying, after having released more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks to combat confidential information.
How Biometry Envasived Our Lives
Did you finish the words to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometrics of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as well as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of private life confirm this failure for biometrics, but are concerned.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorized 774 systems of recognition of entrepreneurs, hand-held or hand-to-hand networks in companies, administrations, canteens...
"All the world will soon be identified, anywhere and anywhere," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among others, and pessimism, among others?
Biometres will be based on new techniques, which will allow new services for citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are digital prints, hand-circuits, and the wine network of the paum or fingertips.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very busy fingers and their impressions are illusory," notes Philippe Robin, the technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the wine network and the hand-circuit, are subject to voluntary and precise management of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture these data to their satisfaction - and a misunderstanding: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
Consequently, research has been conducted for twenty years on other approaches, such as the recognition of face or ice (the colored part of the ice).
These techniques become operational as a result of increasing the precision of the captors and the capacity to calculate the computers needed for data analysis.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, the Cyrille Bataller, director of the Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris in motion.
"Today, we have research on the recognition of voice or how to walk through sound recorders, but there is a need for a quiet environment," says Sridhaar Iyengar, director of the Intel Labs Security Research Research.
Unique and infamous markers, DNA also raises expectations and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the latest biometric data," confirmed Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and prospectus to CENIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a cost of $90,000 to analyse DNA samples on the location of a crime and at an hour.
Biometric uses are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is what it claims to be).
The identification has so far been the delivery of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with information that the State already has on all citizens.
This allows you to make sure that a person does not try to offend someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP when entering a hotel or store.
"We recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celibrites that freely travel on the Internet," explains Danny Nassif, in the NEC France, of commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take photos of a person making the hole in a store, follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The initial authentication was related to physical access (frontiers, protected locations, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
If, more recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the copain that points to another," explains Cyril Bataller, of Accenture.
However, further authentication will also involve transactions, in particular those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by inserting their card and placing their hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the cover of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angouléme by the Natural Security Society in partnership with banks and the teachings of the great distribution: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the client did not break his code, but introduced its duet into a reader that scans the wines.
The experiment is intended to last for six months.
If it is final, biometric readers could soon reach French merchants.
Tracks to refresh users
There are three ways to make the seductive biometry in the eyes of the great public.
The first is to explain that it can make time.
"If, thanks to the biometric, a client remains in box 30 seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to provide personal services: within a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you options to measure.
And, finally, comfort by putting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"The digital printers are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if we try to move it," says Philippe Robin, from Thales.
However, in the absence of a thorough study, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Specialists for the protection of private life continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras, and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me afraid of the worst: generalized surveillance," said Andrew Patrick, of the Canadian Commission for the Protection of Private Life.
A driver running at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs has seen an amalgam of £1,000
A car driver saw an increase of £1,000 in order to roll at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was mentioned driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120th floor of Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they discovered the drink to carry between their legs.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the need for caution and attention.
The seven points on its permit led to a 6-month withdrawal of permit.
Howie was also convicted of paying up to £90 and a surcharge for a victim of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners to excavate London's Bull
The Treasury provisionally calculated the tax rate on capital gains, but expected a definitive decision by Mr. Osborne that, in the 2012 budget, has entered a rate of 7 per cent for property costing more than 2 MM and annual costs for buyers who choose to retain property in a company rather than as an individual.
The law of the stamp already applies to the residential properties of the rounds of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708 MM on the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber meetings.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in the law on property of high value and the introduction of the Anti-Fraud Law in the matter, it is very difficult to advance that property of high value is subject to tax regardless of the effects of the absolute housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The loan real estate – 5-10% of the highest price in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector in southwestern London, which is located in Fulham, Wimbledon, has increased by 11.8% in the last year.
Prices in the centre of London show a steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent but have been eclipsed by a "internal market" in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5 per cent) known for a resurgence, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have come to light how the movements of a dog's neck are linked to its smell.
Previous studies have revealed that happy dogs were more likely to move their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while the nervous dogs were more likely to move it to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Valortigara, a neuroscientific at Trente University, said: "The whole world knows that, in man, the left hand and right side of the brain are intertwined differently in incentives that raise negative or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of other dogs, researchers have watched animals watching films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes from one side to the other.
Professor Valortigara explained: “We have presented to dogs the films of other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor in confusion – and we have been able to deal with the movement of the dog and present it as more to the left or right. ”
When the animals saw a dog with no expression to return the dog to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the dog), they remained completely detained.
But when they were referring mainly to the turn left (again from the dog's point of view that removes the knife), their heart rate accelerated and they had the cold air.
Professor Valortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet several times of other dogs and notice that, most of the time, their movement to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will respond to this experience.”
Researchers point out that the results could enable owners, veterinarians and pharmacists to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canadian behavior expert John Bradshaw, a professor invited to the School of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, explained that this was not the first study to consider the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs would easily go to a robot dog when its neck moved to the left rather than to the right rather than to the old one – the reverse of what is in the Italian study."
He pointed out that differences could result from the fact that dogs participating in the various studies did not consider the animals of films or robots as dogs entirely.
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in various mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details must still be specified – and dogs are not exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why they sometimes move from one side to the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after it was diagnosed with a laryngitis in its singer.
Sheffield's group had to be held on Friday in The Hydro concert hall in the city center.
However, his langite forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was obliged to report a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys stated: “After deciding to report the concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham this evening and after asking for medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the show to the Hydro de Glasgow on Friday, November 1. ”
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena of Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the one at the Hydro de Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any disappointment caused.

Pope François named his first cardinals in February
Pope François appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest men of the church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who choose him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will finally choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, since a cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this therefore means a group of 120 "electronic cardinals".
In a statement announcing the new, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman from the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering of all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which bishops would be raised to cardinal dignity, known under the name of the constitution.
"The Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Constituent in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Catholic Voix said that by February, the number of electoral cardinals will probably have decreased.
He said that a pope generally named as cardinals as necessary so that the number of electoral cardinals would reach 120 and as many as 80 years of age as he wanted.
The composition of the next year will be important because this will be the first since the election of Pope François in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a sort of tendency to prefer Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will name the cardinals of the rest of the world to restore the balance," he added.
40 per cent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be elected since François formed the Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from the world to examine how to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided all alone.
"Now François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "as far as possible" that François sought advice from cardinals.
But we have never known such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the papers were generally made up of bishops representing large communities in the Cardinal class, but that François was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is. ”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat directory
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with manually moving files, according to a Friday statement by the American body responsible for vehicle safety regulation.
In some pickups, former seats could present a defect at the level of the Inclination Mechanism.
As a result, the files do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards regarding the aid.
"If the vehicle is damaged by the rear, it may not be able to protect passengers properly, thereby increasing the risk of injury," says the statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the default pickup during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA has failed to examine the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day termination of government activities, which has slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickups Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by around 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickups Silverado and 16 503 pickups Sierra.
The GM's action ranged from 1.4 per cent to $37,47 at the New York post-midi exchange.
A dead worker picked up under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama took place at 11 a.m. on the Marquette Street, near the intersection of the Beaubien Street, in the circle of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to all the facts, the work carried out on the foundations had been carried out there for some time.
A mytho-founding wall had come up during the last days.
The accident occurred at the time when the victim arrived on the wall to recover his tools.
I drove through the car and saw the wall crashing with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who stayed close to the building.
I'm down and I'm going to take away the big glasses that would recover him.
We saw only a part of her two, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in the 50s who worked for a fraud company.
Reanimation manuals have been tried by emergency services but have not been successful.
Man has not survived his severe injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was transferred to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair from an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He said Obama had made commendable efforts in favor of the Obstructionism of the Republican Party.
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in the 2nd year of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a book that is very sad these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients last night and I sleep, this book reminds me of the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a devastating victory and news reporters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends were happy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries went to the White House and the nation was ready for the change.
During the transition period, Obama had 82% favorable opinions in 2008.
And then I close the book.
Return here is a difficult revelation, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, which is like long memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
From the passage of the Affordable Care Act (the Law on Approachable Cares) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "not known" and the murder of Ossama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partitionan oppression has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But once I have repeatedly defended Obama's administration in front of my friends and colleagues, I am no longer able to provide explanations.
I am on the side of political despair.
The Republican ban cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on American private life, or on the prosecution of complainants who reveal the government's failure.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlika, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the overstatement of expenditure authorized during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the House-Blanche to reduce the media to silence are “the most aggressive... since the administration of Nixon”.
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a single Internet site for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that the government could oppose the previous political campaigns.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the political party of opposition and events that are occurring by chance, such as Newton's massacre, affect our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have quoted above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by her application.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and low-favoured alternative that seemed unable to determine its policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term, being free from the pressure of future elections, would have kept the promises we had been meant to speak for so long.
However, while the positive opinion index increased by 45 per cent this week, it is even more difficult to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read part of the book describing how Obama suffered enormous losses in the benefits of Clinton to the Pennsylvania Springs.
At a post camp meeting, he told his team that they had to return on the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, at 15 hours, a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place in Retine Street in Fléron.
The mother, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, didn't wear any helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of aid, it was lost in this border collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system.
billion-president Clive Palmer advances that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The magnitude of mining extraction, which corresponds to the payment of a carbon tax of $6 M, has made this argument to try to remove any conflict issues.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"There will be an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she gets a divorce," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially announced that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after record.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a maintenance of the exhaust system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, take your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper jars to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone disagrees?
Today, there seems to be an extraordinary piece of paper.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for the electronic vote and has recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and would take his new functions "very serious".
The public service is a public service issue.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists headed by the New York Forest Conservation Society identified a new species of dolphin in forest across the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for Conservation and the Study of Animals and Millieux Marines (OCEAM) comes to Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of dolphin in the box surprise you?
It's good news, but that doesn't surprise me very much.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
It is no longer possible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology resulting from the classification or belonging of a species to a species, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on their morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are due to genetic progress.
In the same way, two very close morphologically different species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific duphins and the Atlantic balenas.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic diversity.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only presenting it to this place.
Since then, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have been affected by the extinction of a species rather than by the local disappearance of a population of a wider species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or excluded by the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it should be recovered from nearby stocks.
For the species Sousa quinensis, whose population of the new species has been discovered, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Sea mammals are located above the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This genetic barrier limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, the more stable ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species.
It needs to be known that the marine environment is the least known.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, which is what lives in the Marianne Valley, just 11 kilometres from the sea surface.
More money is spent in the search for life on planets than in marine research and it is a long time than that.
RBS suspends two traders on the change market
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two trades from its market division according to two close sources of the file, which showed a new time when the global regulatory investigation on the suspicions of market manipulation of dividends began to bear its fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including the U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the world's most important financial market investigations, where 5.3 billion US dollars change from hand every day.
The two dealers are the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of the extension of the investigation that results in the scandal of interbank manipulations of the Libor rate.
The bank, who refused to comment on the suspension, confirmed that this month had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation on this matter continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, close sources of the file reported that RBS had transmitted instant e-mail and message files sent to and by an old trader, the Financial Conduct Authority, to the British regulator.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European trader in the accounts for loans to JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European trader responsible for the exchange rate at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, managing senior loans at Barclays and U.S., was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traitors have made any accusations.
The case of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent to and by bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup, adding close sources of the file.
This week, GI explained that she had attempted an action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that she was investigating allegations of market manipulations of changes in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – consider allegations made regarding banks that would be heard to manipulate the rates on the change market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or requests for information from regulators, indicating close sources of the file.
Banks exclude instant messages and e-mails sent over the years to find cases of renegotiable acts.
News on these investigations have highlighted traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth of investment banks trading units over the past few years, but which has been repaid for this year due to the low volume of loans that limit the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of very liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily necessary.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the more frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms " explain that it is possible to start having a low-cost market impact".
The news arrived on the very day when the Swiss Credit announced that a trader had sent a trader to his office in the London Exchange negotiated funds this week after causing a loss of $6.M at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been managed," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation on the mayor Rob Ford was blocked, supporting a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, My Clayton Ruby has never been able to see a "so babble".
My Ruby said to the Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimised" the evidence against the mayor.
This afternoon, the police arrested the casual friend and driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extrovation in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in contact with the mayor.
The police said they had also observed this man delivering colleges in Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
My Ruby qualified as "unexplainable" the fact that the police had never stolen Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, supporting that the police chief Bill Blair chose to be aware of the cause of not acting against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having been witnesses of suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, stop the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It would also have been able to request an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police has not commented, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's "explained and desperate attempts" to make a point with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable motives" that could lead to the deposit of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Budgets in the mid-session, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European Councils are going down on Friday to mid-seat, which is inspired by some new decadent companies, while Wall-Street is expected to grow.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could undermine its policy of quantification earlier than planned.
On the other hand, after an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea grows among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could complement its monetary policy.
Wall Street's futures allow for an opening of American actions to rise after two consecutive refills.
In value, Renault (-4.63%) registers the strongest CAC 40 refill, bluffed by the warning on the outcome of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26 per cent) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing results this morning and announcing the creation of a default structure ("bad bank") consisting of 38 billion best-risk asset books.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) maintains in the head of EuroFirst300 in response to press information that would want AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the change market, speculatives on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy will be well trained, as testified by John Hardy, the Saxo Bank strategy.
The only mandate of the ECB has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act during the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro drop.
In this context, the euro continues its response to the US currency and has reached a lower rate of $1,3517 for two weeks.
The same concepts support the mandatory market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court validated the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for Obama's administration: the U.S. Supreme Court has today declared that the reform law of Obama's health system was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires citizens to sign health insurance in 2014, under the obligation to pay an amendment, and declared that it was constitutional under the authority of the Government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2 700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the level of eligibility to Medicaid should be reduced under the penalty of losing all federal funding of the programme, was consistent with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates at the 2012 presidential election, including the Mitt Romney candidate, were actively opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute made to the former combatants in Menton
At the heart of the workshop of the Trabuket, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriot associations, made this afternoon after noon, a tribute to soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerebs were deposited in two of the three military camps in the cemetery by the Sea Member Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Progress between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza Strip
Four combatants from Hamas were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, 31 October 2013, at night during a violent approach to the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November after its fuel stocks were exhausted, the Authority announced the energy of the Palestinian slave.
A local commander of the Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another framework of the Hamas army branch, Rabbieh Barikh, were killed by an eyebrow strike during an Israeli military invasion in the east of Khan Yenès, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials from Brigades Al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a border surveillance operation between the Palestinian slave and Israel.
An attack against a tunnel covered by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli charm and a blind bulldozer made an intrusion of a hundred metres inside the territory before withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abou Zouhri, praised the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who have fallen in defense of the territory during an intrusion by the Zionist employer in Khan Yenès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"The Hamas ensures Gaza will be a hell for the employee," threatened the speech port.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the objective of its operation was to start a section of a large tunnel in Israeli territory since the Palestinian slave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, to "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that it was intended to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said military spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also struck an Air Force base in the north-western part of Syria, with the aim of carrying missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Movement Hezbollah, reported the Al-Arabya satellite channel on Thursday, October 31.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli break" but did not provide details on the target.
"For the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he was pleased to add.
Israeli Government officials refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
Citing the "exclusive sources" it did not mention, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing referred to a cargo of solar missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement that combats the rebellion on the Syrian side.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had carried out several acts of Wednesday at the site in an air defence base at Sonar Jablé, near Lattakié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of military and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is presenting in Danse his two new group choreographers: Henri Michaux's first inspired poems and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano Gymnopédies de satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the Chouinard's impression, the art of the tics and the black of the white.
A white screen uses a background wall.
On the tapes, as white as well, in the vast space that is the House of Commons, it goes forward, of profile, finally as a line and black clothing, a body.
On the screen, Henry Michaux's anchor is designed.
The body, just pulls, takes its form.
And this form will be the whole part: a set of physical representations of designs.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face revealed, wait on each side of the game area, assume when the next graph appears, incarnate, comes out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relaxes, in group at unisson (a single mass), in large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Glorie of the morning", where, alone, Chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online in front of the scene.
It's the same principle, PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussion and electrical guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
It will happen when Carol Primer will flee under the dance tape, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or retention, part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue to dance.
And the music to distribute, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long as possible, ends by absorbing and swallowing.
As is the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as these hair that turn out or these black tissues that extend the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, imposed, with his tickets.
Result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
The corners of Michaux, such as Gestalt's shapes, open a wider and gypsy imagination than the dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers attached to a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a dark theater, is touching magic.
The audience loved it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the stroke, are more rich.
The scene is partly covered with gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a house.
On the piano, dancers were ready to play the partitions.
Their music diseases, touching, give true fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in two lovely, very sensitive, even erotic.
Group work, small transition islands, all moving, choirs, writing is less binary.
Chowinard's family also appeared in a very polarized, loving parades of men and women.
Love is Carnassian, fleeing or players.
The handle, smiles and small crises well convey the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies in the coyote, of the beings that form the foundation.
But the room takes its real place after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superseded, the cabotin dancers come down from among the spectators, shine, smoke, circle around, play songs of praise, excavating the sauce in a well-known disorder that remains sequential.
The joy and the folie flow, and it's Chouinard's art, there, to pollute the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of judicial proceedings on the Nortel patents
The group that holds thousands of old Nortel patents started a legal prosecution of patents against portable telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was co-founded at the sale of patents that took place after Nortel's failure.
Rockstar, the corporation that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 MD, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent infringement companies in the United States Court of Assistance in Texas.
Rockstar is arrested jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow for advertising in relation to Internet research terms, have indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is the heart of Google metier.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make mobile phones operating under Google Android operating system, which provides a fair competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 m for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering 4.4 MD$.
After losing Nortel's patents in front of Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for a amount of $1,5 Md, a partial market based on Motorola patents library.
"Although it has failed in its attempt to buy patents during the raids, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims more important damages and interests against Google, as he claims that Google's patent violation is prohibited, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a water heater lacking at the beginning of the explosion
The mother would have let a cigarette out of a gas leak.
The explosion of a room in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old mother and her 5-year-old son, was due to a gas leak from a water shortage, indicated Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert posted on site by the park ensures that the source of the explosion is purely accidental.
The mother poured a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The vital forecast of the two victims is still underway.
The mother was designed by the explosion and was furiously burned.
The little boy, who lived with his father and his companion, was next to him and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the ground before being taken to the League, she in helicopter, her in ambulance," explained bourgmestre José Paulet, who went down to the places.
Traumatized, the father was standing at the time of the explosion.
He was able to collect the cut-off from the ladder left intact while the wall behind the house was completely destroyed.
The father and the tenant of the nearby house, fragilized by the explosion, were approved by the President of the CPAS.
The Andene and Namur bombers and the Arches police have intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection stabilized both buildings.
Egypt requests the first President to be elected free of charge
Mohamed Morsi made the investment firm, but it is unlikely that his triumphal day would mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he presented the holding of the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected and successful President of Hosni Moubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
In his investment to the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first Islamic president freely elected from the Arab world and the fifth head of the State of Egypt since the monarchy's reversion 60 years ago.
He stood before the 18 judges in black clothing of the Court whose building on the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We hope for better futures, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said President Morsi during the solar ceremony broadcast directly on public television.
"Today, the people of Egypt have laid the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States under the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and durable organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small truck.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered before the Court to appeal to the new president and, following the Presidential fast of the years of Moubarak, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his carriage into the very frequent streets of the city centre to the south bays.
Considered as the uncharistical "resources" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been greatly strengthened since his victory and his talk on Friday during which he has tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamic but of all who want to finish the work that began in 2011 against President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red dress, addressing the judges who are present in the orange room where he has made a solemn award.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national anthem while he was in charge of you.
Marèchal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by the song “The People and the Army, Hand in Hand...” by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and old lay education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamic groups of students in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on the site of Tahrir, where it is part of the lifting that ended the regime of Mubarak last year, and swore to regain the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former Vice-President, has deposited it.
But by agreeing to formally present before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is to be used, he appealed to the will of the army, showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's talk on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular popular gestures.
Shutdown in the United States has accelerated the growth of the car market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations was based on the increase in car sales in the United States in October, showing the number published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the six main performances below expectations.
The three major constructioners in Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts were predicting an average of 15.4 million sales at annual rate and adjusted seasonal variations, but the market was 15.3 million according to Adam Jonas, analyst of Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the customers of the bank, he believes that this slight brake cut is first explained by "the government's "shutdown" and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first fifteenth of the month".
However, GM has made an increase of almost 16 per cent of its sales in the last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group saw their trade performance improving by October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of his pick-up, saw his sales progress from 14% per year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was expected to be 194,301.
On the other hand, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, against 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.
At the New York Forum, GM action won 1.4% at 16h35 GMT while Ford dropped 1.1%.
Renault jumps in Bourse by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses Friday the strongest down of the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced that nearly 20% of his net annual profit forecast had fallen, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a revision, also announced a revision of its direction.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It is clearly the benefit of warning from Nissan," said a Parisian court official.
In the context of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to Nissan's website data.
Greece: two dead in a fusillade near a place of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was badly injured on Friday evening by two firemen who were on board a motorcycle that passed before a stop of the neonasium Aube in the west coast of Athens, a police source was learned.
The police were unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political belonging.
Some Greek media reported that members of Aube dorré had supported the victims as guardians of their place.
The injured person was soon hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorist police were stationed on the central Avenue of the Neo Iraklio Bay, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident takes place a few weeks after the accused of six members of Aube Doree, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in the form of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of his members.
Scott Brown's call was rejected
Scott Brown, the Captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsived against the Barça to take a break to Neymar, the ecosystem saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club said "very sorry", believing that his call was completely justified.
Nearly 50,000 houses are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Wednesday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the Saint-Laurent River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers in the black, Monteregie with 13,464 and Outawais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also knows its lot of pans with nearly 7,000 private corridors in the Metropole and Laval.
Do you think travel agencies belong to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net benefits forecasts to increase and hopes for record results through Australian and United Kingdom vacations.
The travel agency is now expected to make a substantial benefit over the entire period between $325 and $340 prior to tax, against a previous forecast of $305 to 315.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent of growth compared to the recorded profit of $290.4 M in 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre had achieved 8% of the benefits in the first half and that the second half had started to work, in particular with regard to travel other than business trips in Australia and the United Kingdom.
“From the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are well able to achieve record results on the entire period before the downturn of interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest benefits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector was reimbursed during the second half of the month, which allowed a domestic market for low-cost business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre holiday sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
His office in the United States recovered its losses during the first month where the seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the entire period for the third time thereafter.
Flight Centre operations increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people come on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown strangers opened the fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making any sacrifices, resulting in a seemingly expensive wish with licensed employees.
Assassins took the flight, explained the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, General Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army has destroyed Islamic President Mohamed Morsi in July and deplores the demonstrations of his supporters in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, students will have to study at least one part of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse readings.
A combined course of literature and English language will be deleted.
Since 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programmes tomorrow – the first material to be reviewed radically.
It will be subject to changes in other essential materials next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Reviews Board, will launch a revision of the GCSE structure, with a new notation system and less courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "large consensus on the need to reform our public-trust review system", stressing that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during school year) than in most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singaporean students spend about 138 hours a year.
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more time on maths, close sources from the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of depth maths – as well as the greater importance given to materials in international classifications – would probably encourage schools to provide more courses.
The programme will focus on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in this State and giving rise to the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a gun at Muy for Halloween
Young people aged 9 and 13 were at the door to complain about Halloween evenings.
One of the Rivers of the Muy neighborhood visited by children opened the door by holding its chassis rifle.
The elderly man, aged 86, explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon has been seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was indeed buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, claims the director of the Memorial of German resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"Their bodies were buried in 1945 in a common fortress at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he made sure on a day of great withdrawal by relying on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great events of the Post-Guerre.
The German secret services, the BND, provided as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was located in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally misleading.
"In August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a command," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the left-hand interior, its service status was included with a photo," he continued.
Bill also published a document from the mayor of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the cruelest Nazi shadys to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is a horrible taste.
"The memory of the victims is a large crowd of people on the foot," he woke up in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is part of the important characters of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He attended the Wangsee Conference in January 1942, which decided the "final solution" and, in particular, under his orders, Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the "logistic" of the execution of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Pamela Anderson cuts his blue-skins and adopts a spectacular cut-off boy.
Pamela's blue boots have become famous because of her role in the sex alert series in Malibu.

The former beautiful Nana of Alette in Malibu let her long blond hair fall against a platinum blonde boy.
The 46-year-old actress opened her new look while she went to L.A. Wednesday and shared a photo on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the beautiful blonde cuts his hair, and we're making a discreet change.

He walks in the bow, the jungle and across rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Belle has free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Belle and his team spend almost all their weekend watching hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, at least 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Belle is one of the 10 CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Belle has seen his sick father change the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and return to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
James Belle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematom that he would carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Belle.
We would have led her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Belle has spent years accompanying his father in clinics and clinics, so that he can get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Belle.
You can leave home at 5:00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they've been waiting too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Belle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor for 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio to the United States is 1 doctor for 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health costs are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Belle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and so many of his companions suffer, Dr. Belle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Belle and his volunteer team have practiced more than 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which takes place in rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost all Fridays, with a total of 30 people, are busy in vans after having fixed medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult areas to get to the villages that have the most need for help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They have often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or bus trails.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a party, song and dance and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bülle – with his great smile and debriefing energy – is more than happy to join the festivals.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“ We receive 500 people every visit, ” said Mr. Belle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they walk.
In this travel hospital, various health care is produced.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive cookies, a pair of collected Mondays or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally practiced in a school, a store or a house; after intervention, the patient gets up and goes into the living room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electronic group, the operating room and the sterilization of the material, Dr. Belle and his volunteers work until the first hours of the morning.
It's an exciting rhythm, but musicians in villages usually help the team stay motivated.
“ They strike on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue working, ” said Mr. Belle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make a difference for those who come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undertaken to care for a hernie would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living in this travel hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Belle also works nights in private medical cabins around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which finances 60 per cent of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's gone," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Dr. Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Belle's group.
He's always at the hospital or trying to find the money for his association so that he can conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Belle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they do not have.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help save blood or pass instruments to Dr. Belle," said Mr. O'Malley.
That's not something you have the chance to do in America when you're studying medicine in the second year.
Volunteer students generally travel to Cameroon, often with collected medical material.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transport and their education are carried out by Dr. Belle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to expand.
For Dr. Belle, the relatively constant work load is not a problem.
Helping others to live happy lives by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” added Mr. Belle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieved of pain are the reasons that motivate me to do so.

The two France de Pierre Nora
Perplexes, universities have long been under pressure to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but highlighting his weakness for the paths of passage, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitring other works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
In fact, but by ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heritier of the fraud that occupys Fontelle at the French Academy?
Certain yet, but knowing that such a sacred oil could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which he had done.
They recognized him as a great student, an encouragement and a federalist of their work, but noting that he was less inclined to produce it himself.
In this image the monument of "Memory Lieux", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages have seen a giant market at the peaks, presented by an intelligent commenter, with a vifu cut of eye and earpieces, but unbelievably delicious.
The two works published by Nora nearly two years ago have already established that the one who did not write had much and very well written.
The book here should definitely make him fair.
However, once again, there is the temptation of housing, intellectual vagabondation, the rebirth being put together as a joined foot of one another.
However, it is quickly understood that the extraordinary objects gathered in this book to such a beautiful title draw the browser to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutional nuance of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: it is a concern of time.
We were invited to give a definition of it together.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, French identity was a temporary essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not inherit an eternal franchise, he refuses to define it.
An analyst is concerned about a family stranger, he errs in a forest of symbols, stopped every step by an object in the form of a repuss, tormented by irritant questions.
What is it, which is the company itself: why, in a country where it is permanently installed in its borders, if it is previously patented and solidized, do these dramatic appeals to unity be heard?
They are not so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, but to converge the problem of the birth of the French history.
Frances and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourgignnons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that falls into two national history.
In the wake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarch, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without reaching into the night; he was concerned about finding the sacredness and much more worthy of unity and indivisibility than he had cut his head to the one who was evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between the left and the right, racism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
In order to make this uniqueity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of Hexagon, although Pierre Nora's American escape might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one revolution, a rights statement, and they want to establish a new society.
But American cosmology only makes it better to highlight what we are.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men trapped in an ancient Indian regime, and much more radical.
There's a consensus revolution when she's here to sow the drama and trust.
There are founding fathers who are always honored, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are punished for making models, and who are of the rest intertwined.
There is an institutional context, and here is a cascade of constitutions, such as such errors to recover and try to recover.
France that's going, France that's coming
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could recover the torn dress from their history, and win the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, central and creative time, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who were then employed to repair the revolutionary fraction, teaching the students everything that had been carefully prepared in ancient France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity was only a matter of time.
This is again under discussion, driven by a new type of immigration, threatened by the amount of requisitionary minorities, absorbed in the European area.
So the book offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes on and the circumspect of France that comes.
At first, he took it from the story, which should have some surprises.
We found out that the truck was a married man.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessively, around the same idea.
The ruler of the liseri was located in the center of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, over a half century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but he was referring to the initial exercise of the thesis, we trust, as the green salis, that he will end by doing so.
Some in a less angry, more ebb and more subtle form.
But we're not fooling around, it's all too complicated.
Because more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis tells us the internal need for life.
An Ancient Otage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Taken to Beirut on March 8, 1986, with three members of his team "Antenna 2" who came to film a demonstration of Hezbollah, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Since 2008, he has been involved in the creation of the Defence Association for the World's Otages, which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
After more than 1,000 days, the four Aqmi (Al-Qaida at the Islamic Maghreb) guests Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grège after noon, they were able to find their families.
And try to take the course of their lives for a while.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, ex-rapporteur, retired since 2008, president of the "Otages of the World" association.
On the night of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I was released, I found myself in the trunk of a car where I met - without seeing it because it was black - Roger Auque.
He told me "we're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very inclined too.
It's war, and those who lead us are also very tender.
They're laying us on the side of a trottoir.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
French escorts us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for parents, family, friends, press...
I remember having a bath for an hour.
And I've got a shot at France's embassy.
I also remember a short night to talk to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is always there because we have no means to escape to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrive at the airport, a private plane is taken to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua is aboard.
How did your arrival on French soil come about?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible boutique.
And a lot of media.
When I was part of it, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and it's full.
The bottom of the plane's ladder, my son and my parents, my friend, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
Motards take the fight to take photos and follow me to my home, where I have to do some police to prevent some of them from getting up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so difficult to make clear.
We're out of a hole and we're all trapped under the media fires.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.
But we've done the hardest.
In the evening, I'm at 20 a.m., the next day I'm on the TV too.
Then begins a sort of adaptation to life, very slowly, for one or two months which are a little like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing been conducted?
I had the right to a first medical check in Corse.
The rest has been done in Val-de-Greed the following days: radios, exams in all kinds and meet with a psychiatrist.
This is not a session that does everything but we know we can rely on him, to remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with information services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
That was logical.
I didn't get it.
How do you react today to the release of Niger's four hostages?
I hear what they're saying.
The debate on the reasons, in particular.
Some things upset me, others less.
I am trying to do some things between questions about my past as an otage and my cassette of the president of the "Otages of the World" association that allows me to stay away, and it seems to me much more interesting to deal with.
I ask, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of abortion.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify for "political" arrest warrants - which is the case most of the time - and to allow arresters to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is doing this.
Why don't we tell the hostages "you broke the rules of war, like all the Geneva conventions, you will be brought to justice"?
However, it seems to me to be founded, legitimate, struck with a good sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and that surprises me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger grows in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they were down in the streets.
A mobilisation throughout Egypt to claim the re-establishment of the first democratically elected president of the country.
This is not a trial that highlights this militarate of the Muslim Brothers.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a trial.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial involving a pro-Morsi, who is intended to judge Sisi, not the contrary.
Morsi has to judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
The police used lacrymogen gas, 60 protesters were arrested in Alexandria.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel challenges 9 American States to violate homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized gay marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with", the Minister in New York recalled in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to deliver these cards to couples of the same sex in the facilities of the National Guard" on their territory, he said, accusing these States of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided on these bases or access to their stores.
The Secretary-General of the Defence said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The front of the nine States was launched by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the implementation of the Texan National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas Act and the Federal Act on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to some 5600 active persons, including the National Guard, the Reserve and the Retirement.

The public will be able to admire the technical trials of young people who, for some, are already in high-level competitions, for the young prodige Hierois Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place for European champions in Copenhagen this year, and he likes nothing more than to show up to competitors who are more than three heads.
The mayor of Toronto chases journalists came to question him about a drug deal
In Canada, Toronto's capital is suspected of drug use, according to several media.
A video delivered to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested, Rob Ford, has always refused to consume crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
This Thursday, he stole several journalists from his property and came to question him.
We also think that images sometimes do not need an explanation or comment.
A rare case detected in a chat in Val-d'Oise
On Thursday, 31 October, the authorities announced that a case of rabies had been detected in a chatton in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France has been responsible for Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The chatton was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"A epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and carry out people who could have entered into contact with this chat room between 8 October and 28 October," states the Department of Health and Agriculture.
"Five persons who have been in contact with the chatton have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"To man, the preventive treatment of the human race, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," says the Communication.
Departments now call on persons who would have been killed, arrested, ill-treated, or ill-treated on a mucus or on a skin covered by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with this cat between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
"Since 2001, France has been free of rabies from other countries, according to the Communication.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last reported "autochtone" of rabies is on a farm in December 1998 and that "France is officially responsible for this disease in November 2001 by the International Epizootic Office (IOE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported dog in Gambia was registered in 2008.
"Range is a mortal disease if it is not treated in time," recalls the departments and is transmitted for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama goes back on his reform of the health system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his promise with no ambiguity and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health system, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received feedback from their suppliers, the Republicans criticized the president during the last days in accusing the American people of fraud.
Here, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The great majority of people with health insurance that they deserve can keep," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called “a lack of flexibility in the current situation” regarding settlement, President Obama urged the Americans who received this advice to seek new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain full and better health schemes for the same price, even less expensive than planned.
"You're going to win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if 5 per cent of the people who contracted their own insurance were forced to change the regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius when she witnessed to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, pointed out that the launch in October of the online market had failed to “earnestly”.
"I am also frustrated and irritable than anyone," she added.
I've had to restore your trust.
It is an exhilarated Kathleen Sebelius who spoke this phrase, while she believed in her micro cut, addressing an assistant behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following a exchange of conflicting views with Billy Long, representative of the Republic of Missouri, to find out whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long had not stopped asking Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily denied the government's insurance to sign a scheme via HealthCare.gov, which she now sold to millions of Americans.
Vettel extends a special case to Abu Dhabi
The highlight of the election, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, fourth champion of the Formula 1 World, has trained for the free trials of the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi Friday, a special case whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose among 1,500 designs sent from around the world, in the form of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from his darkness.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore be seen near the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel had to carry this box on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that there will be another special case on Sunday, for the course, to mark its fourth world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launch is Part of the bathroom
We're not at all mistaken.
In the mind of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Part of the Banley" is not only addressed to the bankers.
I've chosen a letter from France as a logo, he's right.
When I'm talking about bananas, I'm addressing all those who are excluded from the big national family.
It does not prevent, in its project, presented Thursday at a press conference in Aubervillier's native community, from being born with the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural potential that characterizes all districts.
My proposal no.1 is to create a department of multiculturalism, please indicate it.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years of age, is now said to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
In 2002 he joined Jean-Pierre Chevenement, then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I apply in my programme are tied to the left, but if the right people are willing to support me, I will also listen to them, and continue to do so.
There's only the extremists I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune built his program -consultable on the Internet - from many topics aimed at talking to the homeless, including young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the property guard function...
There are still candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this risk of being just, acknowledge it."
It's a problem of time and money.
The Bany Party should even be represented in Auberviliers through my application and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that there are already seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support mail I've received since yesterday don't all go out of the bathroom" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, without any precedent, that the American spying "was too far away in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry pointed out an improvement in the defence attitude of the United States in view of its monitoring programmes by acknowledging that, on several occasions, the spying was "too far away in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of fire-fighting revelations from the complainant Edward Snowden about NASA's spying activities came to light the day.
The refugees put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is inevitable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned some things in automatic pilot mode since we had the opportunity from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to admit that the American spying had exceeded the bars, but stressed that the rights of each had not been violated.
He stated: “In some cases it has gone too far in an inappropriate way.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify to the people that he has now conducted a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels confused.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, stressed that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to jump. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, exploit them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they do it?
We've been fine and well prevented from falling planes, explosives and people being killed because we could have learned facts in advance.
In the meantime, US legislators will return to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American spying case and convince Europeans the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the chairman of the Senate's Sub-Committee on European Affairs explained yesterday.
Senator Chris Murphy du Connecticut stated that he had spoken to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had experienced regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration caused by the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to combat terrorism," said Murphy, a democracist serving his first mandate, and the Vice-President of the European Senate's Sub-Commission, at an interview since Washington.
And I am going to go to Europe to help them understand that we must continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that NASA has received millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with certain United States allies, but this week the director of the agency stated that it was inaccurate and that this was a misunderstanding because it was about the metadata that NATO alliances had collected and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures have been made of documents published by Snowden that the NSA has intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Information Services, James Clapper, justified the exposure of alliances by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a practice that was consistent with both sides.
In this troubled atmosphere, Murphy indicated that her office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and that the delegation hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and two rooms.
The names of other participating legislators should be revealed in the days to come.
He indicated that the router remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to prove "afflicted" closure.
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs they have been applying for themselves for years.
"We can modify our monitoring programmes in order to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to do the spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to return this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the savings generated by the American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States monitoring activities.
The London Forum closed down on Thursday, stormed by the bad results of Shell and the next day ad by the Federation of Maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian calling for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, called for trial and was released.
At first, Stevie Rochelle Bamford was convicted by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who had mastered it, attacked him on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her small Australian friend.
Phuket's police questioned Bamford for two days before she discovered the history of all the rooms.
She was detained in a local commission cell before hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in Phuket's Periphery rather than in a women's prison.
It's about the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of rugby Peter Tunks, who called the Department of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's welfare and wanted her to come to Australia.
“ We are obviously living a moment of despair, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible, ” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed for the trial and was released after the execution of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that it was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai legal sources have indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but they have warned that the appeal could lead to an allegation of punishment that could go into prison for up to two years and imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also try to round up its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to a acquisition.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters as well as the RSCA's cars.
The French police decided to impose strict rules on the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-German fixed Tuesday, by Marie Verbeke, the spokesman of the Brussels-midi police area, on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to attend this meeting of the League of Champions will have to use the transfer system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus traffic will be escorted by the police from an old Reek border post to the PSG station," the spokesman said.
The procedure will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had intended to return to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture had revealed that measures had been taken to allow for arrests to be carried out," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a native language other than French.
That's what motivated, one year ago, to consult with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff, to think about ways to better integrate students living on horses between different cultures.
The School Commission has just opened its vision of "Live together in French".
The diversity vision has continued for a year in schools to help students of all origins discover common references that are not limited to French.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are repetitious.
Big names of writers, artists, whether they're deaf or they're from other places.
Who are our builders?
"So, projects are created so as to identify themselves in all of this," explains the President of Vision diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the New World Institute, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"For example, on the transmission of what Quebecese culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations that we live in, within the student client," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research center that will provide tools to teachers who, at times, come from others.
Rachida Azdouz, University of Montreal, will be the Scientific Director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"From different educational strategies, that's the real need," she said.
Research will include all of its English: language, school, social and cultural.
