Republican strategy against the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans had justified their policy on the need to combat counterfeiting in the elections.
However, in the centre of Brennan, they consider the last myth to be that the case of counterfeiting in the U.S. elections is more rare than the case of death from the strike.
At the same time, only 300 cases of electrical counterfeiting in the United States have been reported for ten years.
One can say with confidence that these new trends have a negative impact on the voter's mark.
In this sense, such actions have been partially discrepancies in the American democracy system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most Governments have adopted laws that have complicated the registration or voting process since 2009.
This event was new following elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were adopted only for one year in 2011.
The new electoral laws require the elector to provide evidence of identity with the photograph and evidence of the existence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, annul the right of voters to register on the election day, and take the right to vote for citizens with jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State had forced voters to submit a photo-certification certificate.
India became the first state to make such a request.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in India in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been speeding up this practice in other countries as well.
Over the past two years, they have initiated legislative projects that require voters to provide identity recognition with the photograph in 34 countries.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity evidence such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million people who have reached the age of voting, do not have a certificate of identity with a photograph issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 had no such document.
The cost of obtaining the required identity certificate is often greater than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities and low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people working less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required identification with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who appear to vote for candidates from democracies in several countries are not allowed to use their photo-based identity certificate.
That is why the same States allow the members of the fishing and fishing clubs, which vote primarily for the Republicans, to use for the voting of the approvals issued by the clubs.
By 2004, no State had required evidence of American citizenship to vote.
The first such requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are a citizen of the United States.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the vote of the exits from Latin America.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters voted in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011 the Republican legislators initiated the laws to abolish the registration of voters on the day of the vote in eight states.
They have also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction has not gone unnoticed.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the electoral registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in 17 per cent of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the current vote.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted recently were Africans, although only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters were the last to be elected.
The same thing happened with exits from Latin America.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in favour.
Unlike whites, which formed 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters were present.
Of course, democratic legislators and their parties are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were endorsed by democratic Governors.
The most numerous laws have been suspended by the intervention of the Attorney-General of the United States.
This has resulted in a partial limitation of negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted laws requiring identification with the photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have entered into force will inevitably make it difficult to exercise electoral rights in the 2012 elections.
Critics of democracies condemned the premise of the laws that had been adopted, given the obvious focus on the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Centre shows that the countries that adopted these laws represent 171 out of 270 votes in favour of the electoral college in order to win presidential elections.
It is too early to believe that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions have a negative impact on the voter's mark.
In this sense, such actions have been partially discrepancies in the American democracy system.
Screening of the front iron arm: whether to pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false, false, and sometimes negative results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so unsatisfied, are more likely to suspect.
Do you have a test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have seen numerous cases of injury among the study groups, so the data obtained are difficult to interpret and difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality in patients who had gone through screening and those who did not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis was 30 to 40 per cent higher than those who did not pass the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend that the test begin 50 years or 40 if one of the immediate relatives had cancer.
African men of origin are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
The cancer can be aggressive and powerful.
The patient should be informed of the risk of his cancer, offering options for it, without compulsory treatment of a simple arm, which does not pose a risk to life in a long-term perspective, but in such cases, in the interest of active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men with cancer will not undergo treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a life-threatening threat.
We will offer them an active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
More and more, we clearly define the criteria for deciding who should or should not have a course of treatment.
So I would recommend that the test be carried out anyway.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not this test is necessary.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created an instrument to assess everything and to counter the PSA test.
This document is available in the near future at http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, monitoring of the health of life remains a better way of reducing the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one had burned any more, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," emphasized André Bolly, a Canadian cancer secretary.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cases of cancer have been caused by inheritance.
A number of types of cancers remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
The surgery is associated with 85% of cases of mild cancer.
And it's a risk factor for many others.
It is harmful to people’s health.
"Also today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said press secretary André Bolly.
It is reassuring to know that within 10 years of refusing to smoke, half of the risk of death from cancer is reduced.
Other
According to KAR data, excess weight and ageing also contribute to the occurrence of disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, cold and direct fluids, food, ice cream, and breast cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against the cancer of the lung,” adds the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of white meat.
In too many quantities it increases the risk of the presence of a fatty fluid.
It should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by cutting, drying or salting may lead to the formation of concentrated substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the organism and lead to cancer," explained the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years many scientists have been studying the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer.
At this point, however, the results of these studies cannot be described as unambiguous.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies provide conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of simple cancer development, the other resulted in a negative result.
The impact on the development of vitamin D is also not fully clear.
However, Mr. Bolyo stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family anomalies with the doctor.
"The evidence of analysis does not lead to cancer."
In detail, the Bozo Higgs
In the past summer, the report that scientists may have been able to detect Higgs' bubbles has caused this food supply, not without reason.
It is thought that this bomb is causing the mass of all parts in the universe, not very little.
In addition, this is the last part that was foretold in the Standard Model - our best model - or, in any case, "the least imperfect" description of nature and behaviour - but which had not previously been able to discover an experience.
But physics is not yet convinced that this is about the Higgs bozo.
We know without doubt that we are dealing with a really new part and that it is a strong reminder of Higgs' bum, as foretold by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seems to confirm that some data are not yet fully available.
Let's imagine everything about the Higgs bozo, as the chances of being mistaken are minimal, and let's see what that means.
In this world, there is a law that is absolutely inevitable, which declares that two things cannot be done in the same place at the same time.
You don't have a chance to break this rule, you don't even try too hard, or you're hurting yourself.
But although the physical elements are quite strange, it also shows that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of exclusion of Paul, which suggests that the two parts cannot take the same space at the same time if they live in the same "quantity" — this "state" is in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physics divides parts into two categories.
On the one hand, we find well-ordered citizens called farmers who respect the principle of Paul.
On the other hand, there are bozos, an angry gang of anarchists who have no respect at all for this principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site Particle Adventure Laboratory of Berkeley, these bozons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the zones we will not talk about here, and the "part of forces" through which the main forces of nature are spread and which in some way are associated with Higgs' bats.
These are the most important bozons, it should be emphasized that not all exotics are as much as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this Chronicle, it's because of one incredibly bonfire, a photo, or a light part, which is a "curer" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a part with an electric charge is speeding up or changing direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone broken in the spring.
From this "infrared" there is an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared removal, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is no other than a photon - and thus one of the binoculars of the "permanent force".
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs bin, with the only difference that in order for that bomb to appear, it must be "damaged" another field, the Higgs field.
However, the field of Higgs is much more stable, much more stable, and it needs to be built up with very high energy, as if it were about the frozen fruit, whose surface could only be covered by a very large stone.
That's why there's a huge speeding part like the one operating in CERN, the Big Adrone Collier, which is a 27-km diameter ball! - to achieve such huge energy.
Analogues with the electromagnetic field are also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others don't: a bookbook, for example, will never be held on the refrigerator itself.
The same is true, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as photons, shells) do not have it.
So, what can all these studies bring, Mrs. Plammond?
In science, they are used to verify the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM), and this also makes it possible for physics to distinguish between the results of the monitoring and forecasts of the PM.
Furthermore, some of them desperately want such a distinction, i.e. minor discrepancies could open the door for “new physics” and close some Models doors.
Finally, it must be said that there are still significant deficiencies, without any explanation for gravity (i!!) or for dark matter, which represents about 80 per cent of the universe (i.e.!).
But they haven't found such differences in the CERN.
Effects
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average statistical person are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it does not.
Consider: At the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in the labs of Bella could not even imagine the revolution that would cause their work.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the silent physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Laboratorys, where laser was invented in 1960 and who developed the first permanent laser (previously impulsible) in 1962, said that the laser was initially viewed as a "laborary Gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for a accompanying study tool.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small world dance in 1969 during his optical studies.
This figure, although not all of its original purpose, now serves as a “eye” for all digital cameras and earned the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collier is necessarily going to change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The Commission had recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec.
The debate must be resumed soon, and a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Long tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. Still lived in his apartment in Monterezia.
The simple cancer that destroyed his inside gave him a two-year break.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the embrace of Victor Gadbu's palliative care in Belgium, where he was sentenced.
"But it's always a shock, it can't be prepared," he says.
The disease does its work: an incredible weakness that does not allow itself to go to the toilet and even ask for it.
Sitting at the table where there is an appetizer dinner, he gives it and agrees to help him get food.
He's ashamed, he's even tired of enjoying talking to strangers who work around him, taking drugs, taking him to the bathroom.
Virtue before normal death.
"My greatest wish to be cured of diarrhoea, it's humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure.
"They teach us that a man must stand up for life," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbu's reception.
Regression to the child's condition is for some unexplained humiliation.
"Everything depends on the ability of the human being" to calm down with the fall, he claims.
Just as many people who are in a palliative manner believe, important events are also happening in the face of this fall.
Patients who go into the palliative home of Victor-Gadbua are suffering from cancer.
The forecasts will take up to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the medical team and nurse are no longer providing assistance, called “care. ”
Ms. A., 89, is more afraid of dying "from breath."
But that's why I got to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her put a mask that eases her breath.
She still looks forward to the next few days of her son's visit from Italy.
With the assistance of a group of volunteers, Victor-Gadbua is welcomed to provide body care and food assistance.
It's also a palliative care that remains when there's nothing more to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, 11,700 residents are in one place at palliative facilities.
It's very small, considering that we're all going to die sooner or later.
This life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors.
It's the comfort of physical, emotional or mental.
We agree with the dying person to provide the reindeer from the brand or pepper, regardless of his request.
Diabetics are no longer allowed to control the sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we brought a beer to Mr. H. who died tonight.
His son got that beer in his legs the next morning.
"We help our relatives, as well as the patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
At Victor-Gadbu's reception, I don't look like the previous day.
A number of 93-year-olds who enjoy their last meeting with the family in the courtyard, sitting on their backs during the toast in his honor, tragically die a 36-year-old man, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children, and trying everything to survive.
"In the last half of three to five cases, cancer patients are always under 45 years of age," said Dr. Christian Martel, concerned.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbu's home and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, but that care is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have died at the final stage of their life, either at home, at the hospital or at home.
And some institutions, such as Victor-Gadbua and the Society of Palliative Care at the home of the Greater Montreal, are more or less specialized exclusively in cancer care.
That is, this major gap in Quebec's health system has caused many doctors, who have been trained in palliative care, to fear the adoption of the law that regulates euthanasia and aid in suicide.
Starting in October, the manifest signed by palliative care lights, Dr. Balfurum Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapponant, and evidence of their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before it is allowed to move to Athens.
Recently, she says, - I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients by the end of the day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hope for the survival of Ellen Richard was already minimal when she stopped developing chemotherapy.
When I told my uncle that I was stopping treatment, she answered me, and I'm sorry I stopped fighting, she told me.
At that, she told me myself that my days were worth it!
There's no need to worry about it.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death are grateful to meds because they have not complied with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely enforced in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monro, director of palliative care in the Community of Palliative Care at the home of the Greater Montreal, patients are not able to recover in 8 per cent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often escape to a palliative session in which the patient sleeps until his death, from time to time, or from time to time.
We can't pretend that we don't know about these suffering.
More and more patients who are unable to relieve pain can have access to palletative session.
Pain sufferers always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get an euthanasia" means "I want it to be easier for me."
The creation of this report was possible through a journalist grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
Large scale scandals with immutableness in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, media collection of political parties and Italian daily mafia tell of their knowledge of the colossal system, the construction industry, public servants, policies, union workers and mafias.
"Industry", which was very expensive to pay off the taxpayers of Quebec, particularly in 1990 and 2000.
“It’s a pity that this system is broken down after all the funds have been spent on it, that Jack Ducheno, the MP and former Montreal Police Chief.”
It is thanks to the fact that in 2011, the scandal was spread as a result of the investigation of road-construction crimes in Quebec, in which the Prime Minister of the Liberian period, Jean Share, agreed very harshly.
The Duschen report has established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only the Ministry of Transport would retain billions of dollars in contracts, if some had prevented their efforts to take part.
The Charbone Commission "has already installed two marbles", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "open a scheme that stands for individuals".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was concluded in 2011 by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, consisting of a broad state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Molott Special Unit, who had set up the Montreal Stock Card after 2009, to terminate the contract price increase.
A series of searches have been conducted over the past few weeks, and a number of municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Markett, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
On the other hand, Jill Wayancur, recently retired from Mr. Laval's post, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected of being received on several occasions when the State order is placed.
In addition, a number of engineers have been charged with communicating with Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito.
The latest bombing of this bomb resulted in a result of the "system" of the acquisition of public contracts.
In a few years, Zambito has awarded 3 per cent of the value of the contract in Montreal, a midwife, who, in turn, translated the money from Mr. Jeralda Trambla "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito had spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) on various provincial parties, mainly liberals who were then in power.
He also recognized that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party of Natali Normando.
Cancellation contracts with higher value
In Montreal, the corruption system worked unabatedly.
Jill Surprenan, former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: for ten years he received from the construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and receipts for a total of $736,000 in exchange for the canal contracts he had won.
Other road construction officials acknowledged that they had been arrested, accounting for 30-40 per cent with false charges.
Then one of the organizers of the mayor's party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget, filling the party's cash-flows.
Following these findings, Mr. Trumble withdrew in early November, bringing Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first Members of Montreal to be concerned.
Mr. Rivier de Perry, in the eastern part of the island, has been opposed to the sale of a municipal property of $5 million and a transfer of $1.6 million to the construction library since 2010.
70 per cent of cash spent in pre-election campaigns
She says that in a final investigation that will be launched, she “sits for a point to understand the functioning of a system that is moving towards the end to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process is characterized by a "skinned but positive" process.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we're going home.
Regular.
Jacque Dusheno notes from his side that "the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "selective officials who knew about the scheme" but who did not participate in the machinery.
Given that the share of cash in the funding of the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he says: "I was told that it was just a joke about reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to $100 of party donations, but this will not change the situation: "We will not have to limit the electoral costs, the money will be wasted in politics."
He called for the full restructuring of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: “We cannot go down; we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality.”
If this story and the darkness on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duscheno invites those who laugh to look in his own court...
"PsJ--not FK Barcelona!"
In this season, you've got an unusual size in the GSP.
How would you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual knowledge, but may also be a new measurement of the GSP.
They've got big games.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical personnel are also very helpful.
These factors make me rise every day to the level of my game.
And in time of the match, it's easier.
It's happening very quickly in football.
But I'm not scared.
From the very beginning, I've always made progress in NIF training in Clerfonte, and until my arrival in St. Etienne.
So you're benefiting from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's not in the news to play games at a very high level.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a game like me wants to be at the level and to be at the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my position.
He's been helped by substitutes like Claude Maclele, who played in the same position as me.
Anellotti - owner of the situation?
Of course.
Anellotti inspires respect for all technical personnel.
Today, he is not equal in the First League, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He had extensive experience, and he won no titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big games.
I think he'll bring new Paris titles.
In January, I had an encouraging discussion with him.
Then I left the whole series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSJ season?
First League Lion took us to the leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified in one eighth.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We're trying to go as far as possible.
So far, it could be.
We can say our word to the face with very good European teams.
We began to want to end the first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take the answer to the question at the eighth floor.
Can the PSC be a first-class European club in a short-term perspective?
He's got a budget for this.
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win the title and strengthen its position on a long-term perspective.
That's not true today.
The JIU has financial resources to make this project real.
Don't take the title in the First League, like last season, be a big mistake?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win this champion title.
We were close to this last season.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the end first.
It was a very successful season.
We've finished it with 79 glasses.
In general, 79 glasses assumes the name of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that such powerful teams as Marcel, Leon and Bordo have entered the title struggle, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think that the media are expecting too much from the PSI?
It's normal to expect a lot of us, taking into account how many games we have and how many games we have.
We're ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home, and we all find ourselves critical, of course, that's a little confusing.
We're asking what people expect from us first.
We will never be able to win every exit with account 4 to 0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game project.
The command will be formed in time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we can meet the challenges of modern times.
Look at Manchester, United States, which has not been able to go to one eight terminals for two months, even though they have spent a lot of money!
Taking into account the amounts entered, we presented you on 15 o'clock before the winter break.
This would be a distraction to our opponents and to the French champion.
Leon and Marcel, who were not high in the past season, were "debarred" by this new GSP.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope that in May we can calm down and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSC seems to be completely dependent on the movements of the Golden Abrahamimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some Golden Dependency?
It just means that Abraham was very successful and that he killed a lot of heads.
He's here for this, and he proves he's the star of the First League.
The street where he played, he showed that he was a great game and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects those around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
It encourages others to improve their game.
His Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 from France?
How disappointed.
I was eager to take part in this Euro.
Sadly, my trauma had slowed me down for some time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today I can play good election games.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized in Sons.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham's head?
They're good for him.
He has a good position in the election team at the World Championship.
He's a tough trainer, he's close to games and he's inspired to win.
What was Laurent Blan?
But I don't want to compare.
Blan reached his goal, qualified us into Europe.
I hope that Didie Dasham will bring the Sons to Brazil.
Is the well-served thing (1-1) that hit Spain on 16 October is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in it.
Everyone was fighting for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no such mothers in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The full opposition to the current cash exchange based on the central banks of transactions between the receiving parties to the commissions on their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, the political vision is obvious: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, discovered by Satoshi Nakomto (particularly), is a virtual currency (in the dollar, euro ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol, which allows the exchange of files between participants at one level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousands of websites have taken the battle to implement donations or as a means of payment.
The rate of the battle reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before returning to around $10 today (the rates indicated on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing more than the world ' s exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
He describes the battle as "the most successful virtual currency", "competitive with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currency".
Bitcoin is different from other virtual currency types, such as “credit” used to move in a video game that is engaged in the game process or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central body.
In Bitkon, all the nets are simultaneously owned by bookkeepers, auditors, currency brokers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, such as e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The collection of information relating to this transaction is signed by electronic means using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content file, it may be possible to verify that the bits used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book sent across the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It is through the mathematical task assigned to computers, which, according to the temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
It's about the file expansion phase, that's the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, a short and unique one.
The Burt computers are a new transaction and add a number to it before they're "heating" all together.
The goal is to find a number that gives a unique digital signature (very zero at first).
As soon as this number is found, other cells can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus inseparably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay twice as much as the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed, and the other would remain unauthenticated, as different electronic signatures were.
A computer that's done the task gets 50 pieces.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize will be divided regularly by half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of battles in treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided into one million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased accountability.
The network's life has already passed out and down.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked, and the battles were stolen from the reserves.
"The deficit is not related to the protocol itself," said Pierre Nuza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But there is also a lack of money.
Big games, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such gifts.
Others, such as the WordPress platform blog, allow them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Wicman Institute in Israel recently analyzed the account book and found that nearly 80 per cent of the battles were not in circulation.
Giant sales were announced in November.
“Three thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said John Holmkvist, who works in Coinabul, who is involved in the conversion of battleships to gold.
Pierre Nuza, another author of this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in current money) or a non-connected payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is so out of stock.
The holder better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to set up new devices or software.
It's enough to report the address that can be "photographed and identified" on the phone, explains Pierre Noaza, confident that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to review hierarchical systems for the benefit of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may become a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends to review the various risks that are now considered to be high in the success of the system.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French forces left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capital and Suroby).
NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
It was time for the Afghan army to return control over their territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just us.
We suffered mainly in the Afghan massacres that we considered as terrorists.
And we, with 88 killed soldiers, and the wounded and the wounded.
Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of crests who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the SSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, let them even join the Jihads, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajs.
They are suffering, sometimes helping local rebels, but they will no longer be able to drive themselves farther west.
The departure of the French forces from the base of the Nijrab, which I saw from the heights of the mining trees, thanks to the French credits, was in order.
The convoys of truckers and helicopters, accompanied by helicopters, arrived in Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no tabling on Kabul .
The circumstances have changed since their continued progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
The adoption of them under country control was then accepted as their type of release, return to security.
Afghan women paid for the darkness of these crests, in which Al-Qaida took them, but their situation has not improved in our day.
The former Mojacés, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in subjection.
The main anti-Semitic personnel returned to power in 2001.
They have been converted into State-owned dealers to resale them under the repatriants returned from Iran and Pakistan, using large American sub-contracts.
They were demented; most of them had not fought, nor had they fought.
People like I've heard in a rural area want a government that wouldn't be a country.
Many young people want to go in and enjoy the taste of those who have earned American generosity: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people have stopped the war and its ideology.
They lived in a modern world when they were expelled from Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; 5 million people, one fifth of the population, are now living in Kabul.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to ensure that these young people do not want to return to the dark of old parties or to corrupt some leaders.
All of them, including armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soft operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
The former anti-Soviet commanders have already taken steps to restore provincial partners who would not be subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, with strong local differences, must be decentralised to a certain extent, as the West, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised State with a strong presidential authority, removing the post of Prime Minister who had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai did not want foreign control, particularly before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, beginning in the 1950s, and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been placed on the legs, neither does any plane operate, nor does any ironing system be repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is done except fruit and fruit.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country that had been destroyed in the Thirty Years of War, public infrastructure control would be necessary.
They have heard that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
It only made sense that the Western countries were there just to control them.
No power to process iron or copper on the ground, no means of transport to export them through the mountains, no useful waste.
The Chinese have already left the media location Mes Ainak, allowing international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) to disintegrate a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest workers in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations on a beautiful day.
The French war units were finalized on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance for girls, boys, French-language college, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “sacrifice the heart and mind” and carry out the impossible task of combining assistance with successive operations, the Civil Service with the Ministry of Defence (Cic), which was released in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in ten mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensity of local labour force, have helped to prevent the rise of vegetation, hills, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase in the landscape.
What do we keep in mind about ourselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, which are very heavy in these valleys, which are often over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Mission received ten written requests for small agricultural activities from local communities in Capita.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which farmers wish, as they told me, they need to be given little support, which would well be well controlled and come directly to them.
Heavy species of the Constitution of Egypt
It's a new risk-taking step by President Muhammad Mursi.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that gives it urgent powers, it decided to play a wa-bank.
In the meantime, he announced in the middle that the Conciliation Council would vote on the final text on the next day.
Within a week, the Head of State had provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the country ' s division.
According to his opponents, the President is in favour of his "autocracy's flag", continuing "to violate this word" and "to defend the right".
The camp of his followers was assured that this would be a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum shall be held within fifteen days.
It is a very short period of time that forces Bratev to give up his intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, the article.
It is also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy while the country is experiencing a lack of satisfaction.
Muhammad Morsey, it seems to be convinced that Egypt is voting positively, as he said in an interview with U.S. weekly Time.
More than that, the urgent call for a vote is due to the Ultimatian people of Egypt: "If you vote for my text, or I leave myself in emergency powers", which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Central Assembly, most Muslims, voted for text yesterday.
Most Liberians have not responded to the challenges.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to reach the required quo, 11 rescue participants were quickly added in the morning.
Some very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is no wonder that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, however, have forgotten the fact that one of the few differences in the day took place around... time for prayer because some members of the committee felt that the meetings of the governing body were not being properly adjusted.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday is contained in articles 234.
In conclusion, article 2 was an identical article from the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of witchcraft are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was one of the main requirements, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would allow them to be applied more strictly.
For Muslims, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testimony to their good will and respect for others of Egyptian society.
"Licemeria" is the answer to the liberals that only see the beer.
Because, in their view, the Islamicization of the Constitution is through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of the Shariat.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommie, this is a cause for concern, i.e. "people called for decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals, in addition, have been awakened by the fact that the next director of this university seems to be less moderate than at present.
"There is no specific religious intervention at this time.
From this Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text were not interested, and some of them were educated in the French system" - Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges that "the circle of article 220 may arise as the terms used in it are derived from religious lexicism.
This applies in particular to the "fix" [Islamic Court of Justice, see para.]
And in the future, a question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to make decisions on this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday was criticised because it gave the President of the Republic broad authority.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly decreased compared with the old regime.
Second point of dispute: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will be carried out, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Neither will the court prohibit civilians in military courts, despite the request for human rights protection associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text that they consider to be harmful to freedom.
The responsibility for theology has been maintained, and there has been a ban on harassment, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles are talking about the protection of women anymore, stressing Heba Moreef, from Human Rights Wotch.
She said that the only positive moment was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that was not reflected in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to speak on television yesterday, the demonstration was scheduled today in the second half of the day.
The Heads of State will, in turn, go out on the street on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are looking for holy places, the Pup of the Earth and the sea from the desert
The Promised Land combines Bible truths, modern comfort, and the origin of nature.
"AIF" has given five of the most important reasons to be heard in Israel.
Fortified by the Holy Place
They are about to cross the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this "house" enjoy God's blessing.
And Galilee is Jesus' miracle place: turning water into wine, running water, resting of wheat, and filling up nets.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples, and after he was raised from the dead.
But most of the saints in Jerusalem.
Believers here are on the Path of Scrobbies or the Path of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - You Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretorium, where the court was held, and on the streets of the Old City, it leads to the Lord's tomb on Mount Golgophe - to the site of Raspitia, the Rock of the Anointed One and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
Here is a symbolic Christian pup of the earth, a symbol of mankind’s salvation.
The church of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will move to a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree was grown from which Jesus was baptized.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for Jews in the city of Placia, leaving the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people from different backgrounds are left here with notes of desires that are then carried out.
Walk Vertically
The ruins of Massad's fortress remain a secret shelter from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on steep slopes in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who get caught up in alpineism can get along with it.
The rest of the historical surface is supplied on the canal road.
And in the north there is a well-known Hermon mountain resort, which is a large tourist attraction in the winter months.
He's got a bus-shuttle from the mountains.
The total length of the tunnel trawl is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, at the top of the mountain, the rabbis lived in the realm of the language gods.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
For one trip, you're not going anywhere.
But even though five of them are most interested, it is worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea legends found in the caves of the Judean wilderness, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
He's coming to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibitions, there are extensive representations of the poets of Mone, Pissarro, Renuara, Cesanna, Sislea, Matissa, Modiliani, Chagala, Picasso.
In Akko there can be a museum of Al Bash, representing several halls of old Turkish baths with visitors and banquets of the time.
In Caesarea, you have to enter a unique part of the Rally Museum, where you can love Dalli and Rodén.
There's no tour guides and subroutine lobes.
Income is free and donations are not accepted in a category.
Fifth, the Holocaust Museum, or Jade Wesham, in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - child memory - is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in prisons and gas chambers.
You're going into it - and you're in absolute darkness.
They're killing the stars.
The names of the children of Jews and the names of the lands in which they were killed are also known.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Take care of yourself.
The three main square areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them has pools, aquaparks, dolphins, and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea, even in winter months, the water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is at 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is hotter, and it's been bought for a year.
In fact, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below the ocean level.
The water in it is light, which keeps it on board even without being able to swim.
Passing around is really pretty.
They are here to go through the treatment course with salt water, raw water, and pancreas, and to treat the health of dermatites, Allergians, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchits, sugar diaphragm in order to get rid of weakened nerves.
Dwelling in the Dark of the Past
The oldest part of Tel Aviv is the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Coast.
It was followed by the so - called route between Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
Noah built the ark, and the Persian Ark saved the beautiful Andromeda, where they lived for a long and happy life.
Tourists love to be born on the narrow streets called Zodiac's mark.
They're saying if you get to the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna's gonna be nice.
In Jaffa you can meet young people from all over Israel and even other countries at the photo session.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - it is possible to celebrate the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the saints.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully refurbished theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.

Traveling in Israel, do not worry about their imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
Money in travel is better to be taken, not in euro, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for bicycles (now $1 - 3.8).
Urban transport - in the main bus, but in Jerusalem there is a speedy tram, and in Haifa is the only one on the subway line, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground fan.
The journey in all types of urban transport is 6 bicycles, which can be built with lifts over 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath was marked by Jewish tradition.
From Friday evenings to sunset on Saturday, they stop work on the market, shops, public transport.
And tomorrow morning's work week begins.
In many coffees, restaurants and hostels, it is just a leathery meal that excludes pigs, sea products, fish without a cup of tea and leaves that contain milk with meat.
It offers a large selection of bread from flour and beef, soups and desserts prepared in coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, sweets from fresh nuts - falalal, fruit and fruit.
In the streets of Israel, there are no ships.
That's why there's a lot of dirty cats that's really "playing on their own."
At night they can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The ants love human places and they don't give up.
The rent of the car, depending on the mark, is estimated at $37 in cash (Hyundai Gettz) to 188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
The train's going to take 15 yards a day.
The tickets to the museum are about 30 shekels in the middle.
Cipher Language
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of the travel and rest of the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine have been visited.
There were 118.8 000 Ukrainian tourists in the Promised Land from January to October 2012, with 51 per cent more of the same figure in 2010, pending the abolition of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Powerful" brings to Moscow: migrants copy money in the language
As long as MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing has already appeared in the country with lipo certificates.
Each year, 13 million tourists visit Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of it is Central Asian: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left at home.
Since 1 December, the law has entered into force, whereby each migrant is obliged to conduct an examination in Russian.
As long as this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing, housing and trade.
However, with time promised in the FMS, tests will be mandatory for all guests.
It will then have to be given not only language but also Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language knowledge must also be confirmed to obtain and extend permission to work.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a State language.
The law does not fall under the law and persons who have succeeded in obtaining diplomas and diplomas for education before the fall of the SSR in 1991.
Benefits, accountability and protection of rights
The network of examinations will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute for the Name of Puškin, the University of People's Society, the IGU, the GSPG and other Russian-language services.
The testing of migrants could be carried out in all cities; more than 160 such centres have now been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was also supported by the Members of the Lord and the FMS.
And these human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have been able to ask the press a question, and what is this, in itself, enough?
What will change the obligation of learning the language and for the Russians and for visitors?
First of all, representatives of the migration service are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian Federation Mission in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized collection system will allow 90 per cent of foreign workers to solve their problems.
Problems arise in migrants without professional education, education without language without medical training.
Without any understanding of the language, Sebelev, a future migrant is faced with people who, with the help of help, take his "foot" into a yellow tight bar, where he and his dozens of likes will be exhausted for months without food and documents, which will take 12-14 hours in prison.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They promise their families one thing, and when they arrive, they cheat, pick passports, don't pay the promised salary," the head of the Head of the Ministry of Labour Migration, Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov, confirms.
Don't move, soldier!
Nevertheless, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian Republic are employed in Russia, they recognize not only that they do not know the language of the country in which they are working but also that they are working on their own.
Of course, this is not their fault, as much as poverty: a few Turkmen, abbots, tachyms can even get such basic education.
They have nothing even to feed children, not talking about dressing them properly, dressing them, and taking them to school.
As children grow to adulthood, they are being sent to work for the first time.
It's hard, if it's bad language, they'll admit it.
"You feel ashamed and worthless."
True, human rights defenders have noted an important moment in the law on language.
The testing will be carried out only for migrants who have legal status.
However, if the status does not exist, there will be no examination or follow-up of official work.
In the meantime, most of the guests still live illegally in Russia.
"It's good to apologize, or the Post Office is banned."
Many visitors claim that gaining official status in our country is not that simple.
The reason is in bureaucratic interpretations and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legislation is money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here's a false registration that can be made quickly and completely for the tens of thousands.
Russian police officers know that we have no registration, exits, and charges in the main false documents.
"Six hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," was shared with journalists from Tajikistann citizen Umed Huchadamov.
"Come on, don't come back, buy a living book."
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was found that false documents were not just immigration documents.
Several "lipo" language tests certificates have already been issued by FMS staff.
The separate books are printed on the usual color printer.
Of course, they had reached new owners with no income: each of the migrants who hoped to facilitate the testing was paid for a document of 7,000 rubles.
This is twice the risk of official testing: it is required to employ a migrant in three thousand.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that "steps" cannot simply be bought, matched by authorities and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities are able to promise guests who have not been able to pass the test for the first time, they will be able to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered jobs in areas that do not expect an active community with people.
MWD does not engage in trafficking in illegal arms markets
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very small
Russia ' s MWD proposes that the law be violated with respect to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: to find shots at weddings when there were no casualties, and to fight by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinograd, which resulted in seven deaths.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of trauma in public places and increase the age from which weapons can be licensed, from 18 years to 21.
The idea supported the head of the Committee on the Safety and Anti-Corruption of Iran, and promised that amendments to the arms law would be made to the Lord in the near future.
Not all of it is enough that Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by closing the gap.
There was an open letter in the network, which the authors, representatives of various social minorities, had to reject “unreasonable abuse”.
The percentage of ammunition with registered weapons is minimal, Russia's Bi-bi-si law-criminist Vasili Lesnikov said.
According to the MDG statistics, 142 crimes were committed in six months in 2012 with the use of firearms registered in the internal organs, while 1168 thousand crimes were established during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the violation of the law in the field of civilian weapons does not prevent the offender from entering the black market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at a low price.
At that time, the MDGs claimed that they were controlling the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from offices to officers
The black arms market is filled in several channels.
The main five of these channels are described by Colonel Victor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Geneva.
Screening site receiving arms orders
The first is “Armian or military trace”, a weapon that was stolen during the war in Cavcé.
"The Russian dignitaries and the Russian officers, and the cassettes themselves," Baranez says.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals in the presence of powerful structures.
Baranez explains that there are also police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement personnel.
The illegal weapons are sold from military warehouses.
In many military camps, explosions were common.
"There is evidence that part of the rain was made especially to cover the shortage," said the former soldier.
Baranca says that the arms manufacturers are bringing their ticket.
"A private arms industry is now produced, which is not competitive in the international market, and is producing weapons from the underground on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of the black market is a smuggler.
There are a lot of guns and cars from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There's its production, sometimes a castle, and there's a mafia that's organized a stream," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
Experts considered what a close proportion of each of the sources of illicit arms supply to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Management.
Specialists analysed the reporting of MDGs and Rossat, criminal literature and open arms portals.
The overwhelming part of illegal weapons, the researchers wrote, came from the army and the authorities.
Half of the weapons on the black market were “on behalf of the officers whose work is related to weapons”, says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons are from armed conflicts, 14 per cent are in the arms industry, and 5 per cent are in the "black archeology".
A salesman of one of the weapons stores who has asked for his name to be called confirms that the weapon found by black buyers has not been bought - too old.
Most of the way he says, salesmen go to the military storage for the new party.
A man buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
They write it down, they pass it through the trash.
"He's going to take her to town and sells 900 euros for a piece with two stores," he says.
"The law, the police in all cases, therefore, when a crime-discovery plan is set up, is being monitored by illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"As in the plant store"
The seller and the buyer are most likely to find each other through brands.
I looked at the websites, in blogs, before the company called on me to come to the "God" platform, where I'm going to be the man who's bringing me into the "goose" where we're going to trade.
I knew the price of steel only there.
Military suspect Victor Baranez
I need a trader who's out there telling a salesman.
There's market vendors, but there's also a need to come, provided that Ivan Ivanovic, who asked to transfer what he had in his teeth.
I'm even getting a couple of castles through a man who's convinced.
He's just putting them on me too because he knows I'm not gonna give it to him.
Newsmen are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military officer Victor Baranez failed as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared to publish an article on it.
The schematics, he said, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where everything was "good."
"I felt like a rose shop," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, Baranca says, doesn't suggest what's in the bag, everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, not just buying - we're going to eat with a salesman in the forest, put a mouse there.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons will be good, we start trading," the expert describes the procedure.
Stainless steel
Searchers on the Internet are posted on websites and groups in "Contacts", where they are offering to buy weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents and personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," it says in the advertising shop on the "Buy a gun or a car".
Its users leave their applications and ask questions.
What about minor sales?
"No license at all," asks the user Ivan.
"The TT Moscow Cup" literally forms a "Fedorenkov" request.
The Federal Security Service has now broken down a huge network of underground sites and wants to buy weapons of war.

I have heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside Russian law enforcement.
People take orders.
The buyer is making payments through the bank.
"In response, they send a photo and instruction where weapons are directed," said Dmitry Kisol, a press secretary of the public organization entitled "Right to weapons".
Victor Baranez claims that having left the application on the site, there can be no weapons and no record.
The Federal Security Service has now broken down a huge network of underground sites and wants to buy weapons of war.
"People come like a hungry fish on a farm and then they get to Siberia coal," he says.
100-dollar macros
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to experts, may amount to $100 to 900.
According to Dmitria Kislova of the "Right of Arms", Macarova's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month.
It is derived from long-term storage warehouses under the guidance of these medium-term warehouses.
According to the official Bureau statistics, as compared to January-October 2011, the total number of crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent and 22.9 thousand were identified and the number of incidents of handling and handling of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, staff in the fast-paced and super-markets
Through work on the MacDonalds, all four of the American adolescents have gone to the fourth grade.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's universal corporation and the restaurants of popular fast food networks, such as MacDonalds, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendis and Kentukki Fred Chiken.
Until no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave, or it will be forced out at early stages.
Actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages received by Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of protestors is to establish trade union organizations.
Until this economic sector is virtually not covered by a trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Actions began last week, after a day of thanking the so-called "Black Friday", when in America there was an orgy of land sales, covering millions of tenants and sometimes accompanied by floods.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, with 2.2 million workers around the world, left their jobs and piketed together with the trade unions and left activists of the corporation's store, whose goods were considered modest and medium-sized.
Walmart is selling all over the world, from candles, hot roses and car batteries to powders, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores ranged from 8 per cent to 27 per cent of honey than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many underpaid Walmart employees are unemployed.
The availability and association of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow himself to sell profit goods partly because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain about the difficult working conditions, such as the lack of drivers or manual scanners.
The participants in the Black Friday requested an increase in pay and noted that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
The typical Walmart employee, who received $9.5 per hour, was not on the karman, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berlin have found that if Walmart increased his average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than she's paying for the pay now.
If Walmart overspends on buyers' payments, each visit to the store will be spent at least 46 cents on the road.
They'll spend $12.39 a year more than now.
The Walmart parties note with satisfaction that protests have taken place in nine states and have not affected corporations or minors.
The "Black Friday" continued in her shops from 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight the following day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 goods in a second.
In general, her cassettes produced nearly 100 million transactions in the Black Friday.
The representative of the corporation, Dan Fögelman, admitted at the left of Huffington Post, that the workplace had been left in the overall complexity of the Walmart staff, and that the protest was the overall "regular beer trade" of her union.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they did not have universal Walmart (they do not complain in this progressive city, and therefore they are still not here) and the MacDonalds and other local restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of dollars, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals or pay you for your honest work!
Jamin Williams, member of the New York Stargate
At the present time, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants with time are increasing, but not impossible, and in the middle of their staff earn $8.90 per hour in New York City.
At least they don't work in this city.
How can you live in New York for money like that? I don't have it.
Sometimes it was through the MacDonalds that almost a quarter of American teenagers who were preparing for their adoption after school lived with their parents.
Few have seen this main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly engaged in interviews with the McDonalds workers who complain that they should live on this pay and sometimes even feed on their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum, a comment was made by the author that it would be inappropriate to place children if you did not know what to wear.
Participants of protest activities, which began on Thursday, 6.30 a.m. in the 40th street of MacDonalds and the Madison Avenue, requested that cashiers and fires of fast food systems be paid at least $15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also requested that trade unions be established in the area of fast food.
The U.S. Act prohibits administration from prohibiting and prohibiting the movement of trade unions activists by means of permits and exemptions.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult for the trade union to cover fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main concerns is the unusual current of personnel.
Inconsistencies
The dry protests took place on that day and in a number of other Manhattan-based restaurants.
The campaign was held in mid-day at MacDonalds with a series of local Democrats, in particular a member of the party named Jimine Williams, who said, "Macdonalds" said he was selling billions of dollars, and then he didn't even give you hospitals and pay you for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the mayor of Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must be friendly in supporting fast food workers in order to get them to earn the fair wages and economic benefits that each of them deserves!"
As the New York Times described, it was the biggest act of this kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people were involved, and not all of them were workers of a rapid community in New York where tens of thousands were employed.
Until it's not clear, it's going to cause a sudden cloud of mass movement.
"The peace of mind is in the middle."
The most popular of modern technology worshipers has recently been admitted to the theme of complementary reality through the use of special glasses.
At its annual conference, the current model of Google began early in the summer, and in November it became known that the application to the relevant patent was made by Microsoft.
However, from a discussion with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group in the Cambridge laboratory, Microsoft Sharm Iziddi should be the past stage for the researchers of this company.
They have a perspective on the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with large hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general, what is your research group doing?
- We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but we are trying to break the limits of this interaction.
As long as mankind in the mass was attacked at the stage of work with pixels on the surface, sometimes with fingers in them.
We would like to look at five to ten years ago and warn of the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost one Xbox is not sold today without Kinect, because it's all a very violent management.
- What else is waiting for us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has a physical interaction, many have to do with the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system is getting more data), and the conclusion is not very much.
We are trying to change this, and we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to get the computer world out of our, physically, to make it more accessible.
To do so, however, we need to identify not only the user but also the area around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable form.
And first of all, these stupid roots of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voter?
A popular piece, but don't they overestimate it?
- He certainly cannot be called a panacea - it is a matter of privacy because he does not always want to report to the environment about his actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but everyone's nose.
For example, we had a project for the administration of devices in public places, which we thought of, but not of disintegrated ones, but of such collective, short ones.
In addition, the heat was taken, not by the camera, but by the hand brush, which fixed the movement of bones and muscles.
As long as he is big, but theoretically, he can be reduced to the amount of time he spends.
But it's the future of a mixed type of management, for example, a gesture+vote.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to hand over this gas station to you?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- Is that what you want to stop users from adapting to what might or may not be possible at this moment?
- It's not mandatory, but it's a mutual bond.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow for a more accurate human response.
This may be, for example, laser sensors, they give the right to the depth, which is very important.
- If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what claim do you have to modern cameras?
Doesn't he get permission, deep or something?
- In principle, the present generation is what we can draw from in our work over three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixel 8 at 1000 k/s.
But it's not in megapixels, it's like matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technology is not good enough for us -- it adds to the projectors' work.
It should be remembered not only about the X and Y permission, but also Z.
It's also very important speed, the number of people in the second.
Human movements are dynamic enough, and the current 30 k/s are extremely small, especially for hostages.
Stephen Betisses from our Redmond Laboratory has made a scheduled delay sensor from 1 to 100 ms, with current serial sensors approaching the second (60-100) indicator.
Not all understand how this affects human interaction with machines.
I would be very pleased to have the equivalent of such a device, not just the necessary matters, so that the staff in the second could be increased.
- And the number of cameras doesn't need to be increased?
- In Kinect there are now three cameras, one of which is, in fact, an infrared trigger, and the other one is a receiver of the signal.
And here's the third camera. It's actually the normal sensor of the apparent range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potential higher number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required amount of bills.
It would be easy to create a flexible Kinect analogue, to play with the critical position of cameras and to see how this would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his eyes to the public.
You don't think that from the point of view of the daily use of the technology of additional glass reality, is that one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, always to play, keeping the smartphone in the raised hands is not very comfortable, but here's what I think: the worst option would be the "extraordinary" extra reality, when you could switch your eyes to the smartphone, the projection display and the next exit.
Eye is a very personal device, in which their power (private things you see only) and while weakness is a complementary reality on the eye, it will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Suppose for a minute that manipulation of virtual glaographic objects in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from the Fire Man, but also simply mortal.
There is one problem that often indicates criticism of such an idea: there is no tactical response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the complementary reality is the seventh in terms of human interaction and machinery.
I think eight can be added to your feelings.
As yet, one of the most interesting routes is the use of the second hand as an image-making tool.
She's a great record of rape!
But there are technologies that are actually aimed at providing these "air cardboards" with sensitivity -- for example, the interference of several ultrasounds at a certain point where the palace is located, but it's very weak -- as if you were on the floor.
There are also bottlenecks that affect the nerve endings in your fingers, as well as the prospectus direction.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
Let him think that he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried to do that yet.
Here is another challenge that must be faced for a long time, such as to place a man in a very limited space, to believe that he is on the open, practically endless road and on the concepts of escape routes (not only in clubs) moving platforms, but also huge bridges.
As long as the brain is in the middle, it's been working a lot of years.
That's what makes the virtual reality so attractive to the researcher is a lot of things in absolute initiality.
Artificial, instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the Peterburg Wangard project on urban people who are ahead in the avant of culture and art.
This list has already exposed the light-students of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements are outside the city, often being recognized in Europe, with limited knowledge of the whole.
The new hero, Rosbalta, is archaeologist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirilla Miller, a fighter, dressed in all the beauty that meets in the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, in fashions and verdants.
Kirilla Miller's maps are always collecting dozens of viewers where they don't show up.
Kirill Miller is one of the founders of Petersburg's socio-physics, the founder of new mifologists.
Kirill Miller is a bright man from the Petersburg adventure at the end of the '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
He was also a city man who appeared on the streets in a city that raised all the tension.
He recently took a charm in his hand and became a peterburgic charmer, as he had a difficult role to play in all his divine existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all the beautiful, not in the wild or the bus, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model for the type and image.
In this world, a beautiful color is a compromise between artist, immigmaire and society.
Although in society everything that seems to be not serious is a result of aggression and a tendency to do wrong.
But my provocations are about to start a conversation.
All the history of my provocational actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you know what to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the Nevsco DC, where my work was performed.
I knew it was my way.
At that time, the smell of old free non-official artists passed, and the new, free-types of me were inseparable.
I became friends with the artists of a new wave, with the post-hospital wave that led to the Poskinska-10, and there was no more waves.
I'm brushing in theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except words.
And all of this worked together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to feel at the center of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative powers should be collected.
In 1995, I took up the territory in Pushkinsk-10, and there was a music-artist club, a divine club, a peterburg house.
Many were born there: NOM, Tekila-joza, I remember how Shura brought the project "Uho Van Goga".
Snow and his friends sang a light song under the fan, they were in a long trio, among which was now fashionable composer Igor Vedwin.
When the team played live, she became Leningrad.
Tratenberg was the leader of a lot of programs to the Galivian times.
We gave them Tratenberg, and we got his big career, and he got basic education and education.
The D 137 gallery, the Griboed Club - it's art clinics.
Our employees and all of us have gone.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "People of Our City."
In the name "The Year of the Year," I was called, and I ended my colony.
In the new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, it can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your job is the best way to find out.
- Many of my paintings are hives, they have a very well-expressed relevance and severity.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, the Russian Museum in clones.
Cloon is an in-depth category.
I used to be social, being like this is painful and scary.
But in the clones, everything is mixed. Tragism is gone.
I love crotch, I have a grotto idea.
For example, the preservation of peace through a radical transition.
Now they're meeting in clothing, focusing on the outside mechanism, not the inside person.
Well, maybe he can't put his hand in his mouth and he can't swim in the spring.
And the lie will be removed with the help of the transfer.
We've seen you in the role of the city charmer recently.
Whoever it isn't for me, it's for them.
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Commercial art must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
It's going down to culture.
Previously, people had moved into the room, the gods loved one another, and the other used to be simple.
Now it's all broken down into a micro- community, and now it's hard for everyone to enjoy it.
I'm not a hundred bucks to enjoy it.
Now you need to think about who you're going to like.
Now there are 100 worshipers in every cultural hero.
- And Stas Michelova's coming for a few thousand!
- He's got a brothel, there's a sex-social area working.
And 300 people will come on the cultural island, and 10,000 will not come, and then less management, money, and everything will work.
I have worshipers, and let them not deceive, and let them not profit me.
When I was young, I wrote pictures of them on the wall with Falcon and Larion's height.
I started with a picture that usually ends.
Now they often go through concepts.
They say: a culture of spirituality, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another operation.
I was a man of culture yesterday, an adult of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money for painting.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what's Peterburg not?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this idea: a cultural servant.
But not every one of them can be culturally involved.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have had much understanding in culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are now good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they are deaf, just as they need higher experts who properly evaluate these experts and guide them.
Now it's a beauty plant.
But they're different, but they're honest about saying that we're not all modern art, there's artists who should look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you?
It's not a cultural capital, it's much bigger in Moscow's culture, there's soil.
And on our rocks, it's hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it's wrong.
There's a lot of people in Europe who're going to show, concerts.
We have this layer of tone.
We need to make fashionable art as it was in the beginning of the past century.
Project implemented by the Grant of Saint Petersburg
Born in Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or contact with asteroid killer.
Caravans of spaceships with land on board are sent to search for a safe planet.
In order to preserve humanity, is the main question of how to continue your family in a state of ignorance or on the same planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, this planet is only two, which can be acquired in a hypothetical way.
“This is Venus and Mars,” said the senior scientist of the State Institute for Astronomy, P.K. Sternberg (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
It's only possible to live at great heights or on Venus's orbit... in space.
The question of production in outer space began with flowers.
Six years ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
Four generations of the village's orbit have nothing to do with their land species.
Then it's the release on the orbit of dried, crustaceans of moose-drosophile.
In 1979 an egg was released in space to check how embryos develop in the environment.
We get an absolutely normal bird out.
And there's still a problem.
"The problem that this bird has to find comfort, it has to stand on its feet and start moving," explains RAN Vladimir Sichev, a leading laboratory of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
Not finding a cure, the birds scurried in awe.
And after 10 hours in newborns, there was a complete set of instincts.
Birds didn't respond to the world and the sound.
And the tragedy was that they just died over the fourth century.
"Two times we chose birds, then refused, because it was simply impossible to work with them," states the loss of experimentation with birds in the space of Vladimir Schičev.
The animal's last biological "minitic" flew to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, there will be only one person on Bion.
It was an experiment with crystals that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural there.
"It was as once on biosputers, but again, it was a unique experiment, and such studies had to be carried out," observes Vladimir Sichev.
There was a generation after the earthquake in the space crisis.
However, the problem of proliferation is not directly in space until it is obtained.
It's not a simple task.
Animals, land, natural habitats, simply cannot achieve their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract idea and can create a similar emotional background.
In ethical terms, such experiments are not carried out.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Treška.
And the most precious thing about humanity is that it's a woman's organism.
Our Chayka was flying, and no one on Earth could say if he'd stay after flight to space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
"No one has answered this question," said the Veteran rocket-cosmist of Washington, D.C.
In June 1964, almost a year after the flight to space, the first woman in the cosmonaut Valentina Tereskova had a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman, Svetlana Savičko, who was twice on the orbit and even worked in the open space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have a small amount of spacecraft that has a long flight and a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even for orbital flights," the result of the spacecraft, the Soviet Union's hero, the Russians, Valerie Polakov.
Nevertheless, mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CPC hydrolaborator is a mandatory flight training phase.
This is where the spacecraft develops working skills in the open space under the zero-flying conditions.
Water is implicated in immoderateness.
If for adult water, light and comfortable, but still strange environment, it's natural for pregnant children.
Small aliens would have confirmed that life on the beach was coming out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that babies have about 9 months of age in the mother’s fertility, which makes it easier for her to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical because from the time of birth, from the time of the first purchase, it's been 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," says the Dr. Marina Axenov.
In other words, if the child’s disability is more natural for the child, women need gravity, gravity.
Very fast in ignorance, the muscles of life, tasa, are able to drain fruit.
All right, let's waste this, depending on the incentives.
Of course, in a special room, she may be able to escape it.
"And what else?" asked Valerie Polak.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
The body does not form a skeleton and a muscle system without feeling Earth's pressure.
It is not possible for an obese to wear, as an adult, a special load suit for training.
He'll just lose what he needs.
"And this experiment that we're going to go with you has allowed the birth of a child in a foreign environment to lead us to the land of a completely detached person," stated the leader of the IMP Bioethics Committee RAN Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, it will soon become reality when land on their ships is headed to a distant planet that will become home for their descendants born in space.
Head of the Control and Audit Management Board: Check of the system of fraud has failed by policy.
In the government procurement sector, Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, has ceased to apply.
This statement is made by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control and Audit Administration, from an interview to the website Aktualnë.cz.
"The law will never be ideal, but it must be applied properly, which I think we do not understand," commented Kala's current situation.
Such findings provide a joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter Nechasa has the approach to the so-called black-and-white system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Citizen Democratic Party) would not worry about the inspectors - is it prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be somehow established, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions capable of verifying and fulfilling obligations,” Kala concluded.
At the audit committee meeting in the House of Representatives, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, under which the State Procurement Act was compared.
What exactly was that about?
There's a parallel check we started two years ago.
In other words, the fact that European legislation states how public procurement is to be carried out should continue to be a national law and then apply to practice.
All the information was collected and, even during an in-depth check, there were some interesting differences - simply speaking, we could be "right and innocent" but in practice, we have access to some of the parameters of Germany.
It should therefore not be sufficient to create more and more detailed rules to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you what it means to you?
Such joint control can contribute to efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve restrictions, as this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the right (but not always low) price to avoid abuse and possibly criminal conduct.
But it's not the fact that we're doing this, but we've reduced the restrictions on orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with bumaga so that those who want to find lasers in this system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal issues of the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Does there exist such an organization as our CRU (Controlling and Audit Management) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, our CR is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, there is also a college that works a little differently, but in the main two institutions work similarly.
Moreover, the authority to a certain extent is similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the federal level - in this system they differ slightly from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounts.
What about local law, there's more to it than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some case, Germany can be taken as an example, but I can't say that it is the best in all.
That's because they better deal with control?
Of course not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefits from cooperating with our office, would they?
When it comes to domestic legislation, how has the amendment to the State Procurement Act affected your institution?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short enough, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
As we are monitoring the fact, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the future verification process - we have started using our new tool "recognition of the risk of inequity", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and of course, these changes will occur because of restrictions, changing the conditions of certain types of tenders and so on.
What do you think the adoption of this law will bring benefits or additional burdens on the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are "extremely" and will not be able to comply with them.
In the case of previous rules, controlled enterprises are bound by the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes, with the regional council) that any non-compliance with the procurement law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it possible to break the law in such a way?
I don't think that way.
The system should exclude those who wish to be arrested and abused but not punish those who make a formal mistake without a decision.
Such a system will only create further pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do you get out of this situation?
Let's know that this path will never come.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP would not worry business operators about the so-called fraud system.
"Swartz-system" prohibited or permitted?
The law should be in some way established, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of bodies capable of checking and fulfilling the obligations.
It can be said, "We change this law and we allow it," but we can't say that we're going to be arrested unless nothing happens.
The Public Procurement Act contains sufficiently strict rules as must be carried out formally and properly, which will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be ideal, but it must be applied properly, which I believe is not enough for us.
Roads are narrow, but mainly through.
In some places the streets of Chechia are frozen and frozen.
They're basically going through it, but somewhere with more caution.
Carlovar's End
Today, in the Carlovar region, roads have been passed, but somewhere are frozen and frozen.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be very warm.
The snowfall in the region has ceased, only in the lowlands is a small layer.
However, on the slopes of the Red Mountains lies about 30 inches [30 cm] of snow.
The information received from road workers was known to have been lower because of the fire.
The speed six R6 and the roads of the first class in the region are currently being carried out without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, to bridges where surfaces can be found and rounded.
All roads related to the second and third classes, including mountain tracks, are also on the way.
But in some of their places there are still remains of frozen snow and snow.
Special attention should be paid to the roads that are at the heights.
Pardubic and Royal Buildings
The Czech road and highway management on its pages on the Internet informs that some of the streets in eastern Chechia are freezing cold, and on the uphill roads and roads may be snowy snow.
Road workers are warned of hunger drivers, who can be trained especially at the heights of the Pardubic region.
Gold may be around Lanscrounna, the mouth-to-Orlici, the police, the Switavi or the High-Mito, especially on the streets of the second and third classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 located in Switzerland are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the streets of Krkonoše and Orlic Mountains.
The snow layer is located on the roads high in the Rikhnova-Nad-Kneznou and Trutnov areas.
In East Chechia today, the change of clothing is free of charge.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to more than one degrees Celsius, a light wind.
Plenary end
The roads to the Plenary end are going on this morning, but there is a need to be careful and adaptable.
In the morning, the temperature drops from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent colding in some places, it may be cold.
Leaders can deal with the flag, but the visibility will improve gradually.
Information was provided by road workers.
Shosse D5 is now practically unlimited, but road managers recommend that we exercise caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first class's roads are dry and windy.
In southern Plysne and Tahsus can be found in dry areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are smooth, and in this case there is a warning of the possibility of crossing sites.
Leaders should be careful, especially on the few roads used in the Shumava area.
Olomatic Ocean
Leaders headed to the height of the Olomoucian Peninsula must take into account today's snowfall on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals at the Red Sea and on the road towards the Video Cross.
On the night of the snowfall, the road workers were stopped on the street, according to road management information, about three inches [3 cm] of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other areas the end of the road is usually passed without restrictions.
"On the tops of the shampoo lies the rest of the snow.
Leaders headed by Essenica must have the view that there is a snow cassette in the Red Sea," said CAN (Czech Agency for News) today.
On the night of the street cleaning, their colleagues from Essenica and they were convinced that the roads to heights after the treatment of chemicals remained large and dark.
There are no restrictions on the roads in Olomouke, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful in forest areas where moisture is still present.
The End of the End, the End of Liberia
Today's road workers from North Bohemia report that there are a few difficult places to go.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several locations with a cold or snowfall, the upper road is closed to the site of Telnice at Clinice in the Usteck region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads, especially in the southeastern part of the Chechnya, the opposite, there are no problems, the roads are essentially dry.
Road pressures have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of coal in the vicinity of the State.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for his education were created at night — all day the rain and the snow, the night the sky became clear and the tide began.
The adverse conditions are reported in the main sections and in the I/13 trajectory at the edge of the Usteck and Liberia.
Because of the snowfall of the windy trees on the very road, it was forced to close the road to Telnica on the Book.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to save positive energy
What do you think that less than a month should come to the end of the world?
It's just one of the many worrying news that we, people, are so easy to fall on.
Together with the Group of The Tap Tap, we are constantly looking at this topic and saying that we are the only group in the world that can collect enough positive energy to slow down or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you're going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell us more about these readers?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning here for two years.
We have decided to use the marketing potential of the May calendar, which ended on 21 December 11:10.
Three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava were launched on December 20th in parallel.
They end up speaking seriously, at the moment when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, the hour of the 12 hours earlier than we have, is finished with the Maya calendar.
Who's got that idea in the head?
I mean, that was my idea, and we were all thinking together with our artist, José Augusto.
In addition to our desire to save enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to share with the public in thinking about what kind of world we will give our children once in a while.
At the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and therefore provide support.
The Tap Tap tap group, together with other musicians, has also carried out a campaign against the end of the world called “The End of the World Is Disappeared”.
Are you calling your favorite YouTube audiences a fan of these Beneficiary concerts?
Of course, at the end of the day, if everything is done and the end of the world is not coming.
All performers at all concerts are busy at the same time.
The gymnasiums are also called at the same time in the direct efficiencies of Czech television.
He wrote and played the role of Jesus in the battle of Thomas Gangak, also participating in the execution of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also work with other persons in Czech cultural life, as we perform many charitable activities and concerts.
We are trying to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, and they are interested.
What's the deal from the concert against the end of the world?
In order to buy equipment for the free education centre of STUDEO, we've been working with the civil union Tap in the Edlicc Institute for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the schools of the Edlics Institute and conduct happy and interesting activities with them.
Students have no means to go to teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
Under the project of the additional construction of the Edlič Institute, a separate building will come up in the future in which we will be transferred to this project.
At each concert, a number of musical groups and actors will be present.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to develop a programme that is of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there are Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustra Sphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Mariana Bango and Irji Suhi.
Both details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "garden activities" in the future?
In May, we will be the first to talk at the "Praisal Vishna" festival and, of course, here we will prepare an interesting programme with interested guests.
The next year, we would be pleased to present at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally would like to speak in Washington and Chicago if we were in the United States.
From the beginning of your border plans, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How do you deal with the road from an organization and logistics point of view?
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel to the gas station, as well as all the large quantities of goods and tools.
The Czech ČSA and British British Airways have always been too much prepared for us to be surprised how many times I've been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries with accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you been up to?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have seen that in the east we are still at the base level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and there is still a movement of people on an electric wheelchair in the city centre.
Also, there are no banals such as entering the path of the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to focus attention on people with limited opportunities.
On the contrary, what do we always have to do with the best countries?
There's a lot of stuff, the level of performance that's far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with severe disability move on the streets alone, can go to a toilet, a museum, where appropriate...
It is not very widespread that a large number of people with limited opportunities take an active part in public life, so we are with The Tap Tap for a while!
Respect for the public or security is one thing, but at the moment that we are surrounded by famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everything will really change.
Until these unique cases are people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is now very popular, but we'll be back two years ago, which has forced you to organize it in 1998?
I went to Edlicca's institute as a nurse, and there were many young people around me who wanted something to do.
And since I am a musician, and I am playing on the saxophone, I organized an interesting musical circle together with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our lead Lady Angelovich says, it's a little out of control (Laughter).
The popularity has only come in recent years, or am I going something?
This is true, it has helped us to start joining the prominent singers and to work actively on the propagandist group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess, in fact, does not exist.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of making The Tap Tap so good?
From the beginning, I felt their ability to do something unusual.
In the show business, there's a lot of stuff that's touching each other.
It's logical, everything new is taken care of, and it's been a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I'm ashamed to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression on the person who sees us, of course, is, of course, that...
But this grief is quite great, because people with limited opportunities are not suffering, and all the people we have to complain about.
They are people who can live and thrive, of course, only if they have the resources they need.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not only for them but for society as a whole.
Has it been successful that you are a strict leader, what do many think you are?
If we want to do a good job, we must be in a lot of uncompromising things and keep some discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the fields, and when they realize that they should go to the rehearsal twice a week, visit the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and get something.
At present, the group of The Tap Tap is composed of twenty people.
How many did they start in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We open a group, people come and go, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of the will, our doors are always open.
It will be held until the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, Brno, Fléda and Ostrava Club, in the centre of Plynoj with the participation of the 12th group and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by telemetry at the time of the performance of the song group The Tap Tap “The End of the World Is Disappeared”.
The purpose of the project is to collect financial resources of 25 million dollars for the purchase of multifunctional non-performance equipment for the educational centre of STUDEO at the Edlič Institute in Prague.
The ticket to the concert is 400 kroner, for children up to 12 years of age. The tickets can be bought early in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twenty-second member of the European Space Agency as the second member of the former Eastern Block (after Chechia, who became a full member of ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland entered into close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and has been actively involved in a number of agencies over the years.
But the way to the space of Poland began much earlier.
Prior to the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts took steps in space, but this did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lesson A. Sternfeld, which was presented to the Warsaw Astronomy Observatory on 6 December 1933 by his innovative work "Introduction into cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left a similar audience, and after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won Robert Eston-Peltry and André Luisa Hirsch for the "Introduction of spacecraft".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a major advocate of astronomy and cosmonauts.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
The Gadomian became known as the world promoter of cosmonautism, and his contribution was assessed, including that one of the craters on the other side of the moon was named in his honour.
In 1925, a train train equipped by a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as is the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket had to be used for cracking or breaking the wire.
The information about this drama is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has been thinking of rockets.
The study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Memunar Wolfke and Gustav Mokjiki.
It is evident from the remaining material that studies have come to the stage of practical testing.
But with the German troops coming, the work was stopped.
In 1937, the idea of a photo-electric rocket that was proposed by the Rogozinski engineer came into effect in the specialized press, and the following year the work of the "Aeroplane Tropeda and Aeroplane Bomba" was completed by the author of Lelyov-Kjivoblock.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
The Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczaskot doradczo-Naukowy) has been co-ordinated before all military projects for the use of missile technology.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the work was completed as a result of the start of the war.
The following scientific work on cosmonautism appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Tovarzystwo Astronautique).
The first concerns society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the “Problems” magazine, which publishes four extensive articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Sobotovic proposed that a society be organized, which would take place in space.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already being processed, and it was clear that space research was a prospecting industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (POA) has tried to enter the international association of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and has already become an active member of the OAS.
The following year, the first president of POA, Kazimez Zarankewich (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that position until his own death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has become the first Polish rocket to perform research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of exceeding 1800 m, was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Thereafter an improved version of RM-1A was built and a two-pronged RM-2 rocket test was conducted in the wilderness of the country in 1959.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long and its weight was about 11.5 kilograms.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of carrying out this scientific work - RM-34 could exceed 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor high wind.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was thought to be two-pronged, its total length was 510 cm, and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1C) were developed, which were different from the size of the scientific equipment camera.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 L, and Meteor-1C - 0.62l.
The maximum flight distance of all three types was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first annual tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with an initial weight of 380 kg was capable of delivering a useful cargo of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into the COSPA in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAs two years later.
In addition, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germisevsky became the second intercomator after Vladimira Remeka.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court cancelled the Act on Public Works.
The decision led to a lively discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to consider this issue with a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of multi-dimensional, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that separate economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with unencumbered financial speculation.
As a result, a significant difference in the value of the labour force (employment fee) results in price pressure.
In this context, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer tries to compete in economic competition with the aim of reducing the value of the competitor to take most of the market and thus increase its own income.
This means that the majority of entrepreneurs or the transfer of production abroad, the purchase of land abroad, or the disappearance of waste, resulting in increased unemployment in countries where the value of labour is higher than in others.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the unemployment of which it is made, it increases the inevitable costs of the State for social needs.
As a general rule, the situation has intensified the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the public economic and social damage they have suffered in the aftermath.
The situation is so well known that specific statistical data need not be provided.
Non-permanent private capital approaches create an economic situation for individual States when Governments are forced to engage in competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments have given their own people access to private capital, despite the social fall.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in existing legislation.
The aim is to make the people of the country subject to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic pressure in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to regulate the rights of workers in labour legislation.
As a result , poverty is rising , but the gap between the poor and the rich is widening .
There has been a number of years in the FRG for the public distribution of products to the poor who are unable to declare their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases when employed persons receive a payment that the State must pay to them in order to obtain a living minimum.
Such a scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional workers in Bundestag.
Economic measures in all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic social state are forced to or immigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to live on poverty pay at the expense of society, hoping that private investment will ever be granted in the country.
But the question is, Where will he be taken?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, such as China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, and Africa will still work for a share of European wages.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and media of mass information before the drought claim that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Part-capitalism insists that the State should not engage in economic governance.
Should it be answered to the question of whether private capital is currently in operation, in practice in politics and, at the same time, to the whole State, for its own selfish purposes?
The exact answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually all the most powerful and flying whales in all States.
As a result, we have an unexplained situation of corruption that brings mutual benefits, in legislation where punishment is virtually deserved, but is not a crime.
In the FRG the situation is that, due to the lack of financial resources, public ministries are tasked with developing laws to private legal firms which are closely related to industry.
These projects are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power depends, not on the people, but on the constitution of the Western type, but on the financial and energy groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly taking place, as described by the Appian in the "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The Government is already falling apart and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Recruitment, illegal receipt of mercy through stones and swords.
Unlawful and corrupt, and people went to the elections with the previous vote" ...the ordinary people did not even vote for the government, and at the end of the eight-month period, the State remained unconsultant." . .. "Specially they began to say that the only rescue in this terrible situation is self-government and the need for a man to choose the energy."
As in the past, in today’s society, self-expressed interests are dominated without regard for public interests.
Part-capital capital is not, in fact, intended for public use.
The present outcome is not different from the past: an unprecedented fall of elite without any effort to undertake a deeper reform.
So we should seek the unreasonably liberalization of economic systems 19 and 20 centuries because of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a democracy of the liberal type can be seen as a certain pause, followed by the next tour.
Above all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the impact of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are seeing now, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not a decision or at least not always.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The decision was the objective of political and social reforms that would strengthen the State ' s high participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the administration of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Hoosa Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and they will never come out" - Sting, song "Crooky," where the main word of the refrena is, "we don't forget what we're stupid."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be."
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has always caused many reactions.
Some speak for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians by arguing that it is the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is a signatory of the role of the State of terrorism.
I do not want to think about who, in these periodically repeated massacres, was a criminal, and who, at the end of the end, the present-day Israeli citizen, including the self-governing territories, was born at the moment of the current political situation, and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the task of looking at those who have been working for the past 95 years (regarding the signature of the Balfura Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main cause of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps perfectly, or someone who has taken their actions for the purposes set out earlier.
It should be admitted that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power of one generation could not exist.
Among the wealthier families is one that could be seen as the head of the bridge (I don't know if anyone is above them but is not excluded) - Rotschild.
They don't write about them much.
Of course.
The First News Agency (Reuters) has already purchased in the 1990s to stop hearings related to criminal acts in the areas in which they have been held, which have always led to the strengthening of their power, prosperity or at the same time, and to others.
They have large shares packages in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in which they do not have their share, they are carrying or preparing for war (until there were 7 countries in Afghanistan, after the invasion of Iraq, only four countries were left behind, but at the same time the Russian Government took their country's central bank into their hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the Central Bank behind the Rotschildow Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to issue his own (governmental) money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the federal reserve system) in 1963. Mr. Luis McFadden was dismissed in 1936 after he wanted to appeal to the FED court for the development of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their aspirations by the world authorities from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a three-world war plan, created by the 33rd-level mass of Albert Paick.
The first war was the destruction of monarchy States in Europe, the second had to destroy colonial sovereignty, particularly Britain, and the third had to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (which would be sufficient to provide their comfort and growth, and would not consume much of their resources), the establishment of a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prelude to this project) and the final capture of absolute power.
The method with which a group of the richest families is working with Rotschildham is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of decisions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see FED, which had to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to resolve the First World War through the murder of the Habsburg heirs of the Austro-Venger throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, beginning with the majority revolution.
The first world war ended unexpectedly, which was not based on the German military and economic capitalization (there was no war to destroy the Russian Empire) and, as a result, the division of the Central European State, Austria.
In order to facilitate the development of the Second World War, the Banks and policies have created a complex conflict situation by imposing large military reparations on Germany rather than precipitating the radicalization of the combined mass, then only the Germans were left with enough strong, accountable and simple decisions of the Leader to further establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to be played and actually played the role of the fifth column, when the war was won.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotchilde had created the foundation of a Zionist movement, one of which was aimed at creating a Jewish State, desirable in the area of historical Judah and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The said declaration of Balfura created a premise for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, beginning with the first contact with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
It was difficult to assess whether Hitler had fallen out of the stage where he had been held by the banks, or what he had done, was planned to bring about any European Jews suffering in concentration camps to acknowledge the Jewish state to the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was subjected to military reparations during the second world war, the State of Israel was declared to be a third party.
If international banks can unite it, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, become victims of war on the front line, now with the Arab or, in other words, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is a very giant laboratory, a source of disintegration and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people on the sidelines and opponents of Israel).
Who is responsible, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where is the attempt to bring an end to the cycle of violence if it all starts with individual greed and their pursuit of world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, as we have, international banks represent people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel ' s invasion of Netanyih is a typical example of fascist, loyal international banking policy that is doing everything to start war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to move into a world conflict and, taking into account Iran ' s control over the Ormos River containing 20 per cent of all world ' s oil stocks (the east corridor is only 2 miles wide), it will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockweller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will adopt a new world order."
The new world order in which they are presented is the peace of the Lord and the Lord of the slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves as a harsh financial aristocracy, enjoying comfort.
The world where each born organism is implanting chips, with which it becomes a substance under control.
"And it makes every small and great, rich and poor, free and slave to have on the right hand or on the left, so that a man who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name could not even buy or sell.
Here is wisdom: Everyone having understanding can calculate the number of beasts.
For it corresponds to the human name, and that number is sixty-six.
Argo Operation: When it's worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demonstrators captured the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for a chain of Muslim Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the guardian of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not expect the positive outcome of the situation - it could not allow itself to throw off the boat because it could undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries.
However, the release of detainees in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
This was the attack on the United States' prestige, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their trial brought home a wave of solidarity and antiquities.
The strike in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with Ronald Reygan's election.
The film organized by actor Ben Afflecht, the Argo Operation, describes one of the episodes of history that has brought America a small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the six staff members, the mission was able to flee.
After the difficult perpetrations, they ended their journey to the Canadian Embassy.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA has been able to remove them from Iran, and has helped to provide an exploratory cover legend that they have taken over Canadian passports as members of the isolated group that have been assigned to the country for the summit of the scientific and fantasistic era.
Gender-sharing
The plan, which was chosen by an expert on the evacuation of Tony Mendez, called for Hollywood cooperation.
In order to ensure that the legend was reliable, the specialized journals had written on the draft film, and the press conference had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept in secret, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
The Affleca film is a special combination of several generations.
On the one hand, a real political triller, so-called a movie cinema, a story of success, offers, for example, a number of films about Ouchena's friends.
The film has always changed the settings - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tegerana (the captions show the signs of historical events and how the same situations have been shown in the film - the big differences in this not).
On the other hand, Hollywood wastes from irony and moderate overheating have been eased.
And then more scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating table, at the warehouses, on the phone...
Ben Afflek was a remarkable success in making the rest of the career.
From the mixed actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be an object of ridicule.
The "Argo" operation is his third full-time film, followed by the dark detective "Send, child, excuse" (2007) and the "Hord" triller (2001).
At the same time, it's the first film of Affleka, which is not filmed in the hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is related to the qualities that have elevated the previous film of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Tegeran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, when real events are reconstructed, the initial scenes of the fall of the crew are impressed by their clarity, which also conveys emotions of delusion and uncertainty that arise when history changes suddenly.
The effect of Afflek and his colleagues is similar to that of those involved in the scene (substantial headquarters on the Tegeran base).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to be informed that the increase did not imply a large number of captures of the cinematographic significance.
He's working quite successfully with this few people, sometimes thinking - that's not all going so elegant (the scene where a telephone call in America prevents an overcrowding crisis in Tegeran airport, and the damage to the airfield looks reasonable enough).
The lack of "Argo" is the widespread need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really very tired as Hollywood colleagues, but their staff would earn more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleka's film does not capture a little dramatism, a film that can be viewed with a moderate interest by assessing the order and retro-style that triggers the seven-year triller.
But it's hard.
In addition, this is enough to remember one, still in the sense of living history, as well as to give evidence of the overarching representations of the most powerful and knowledgeable services.
Airchars, bananas and circus regulations
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, the annual review of the most absurd banking collections, has now decided to announce the competition for “the sole absurd regulation or project from the master EU”.
“We have been committed to this last event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, editor of the “Pravu”.
The recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rates of insurance contributions for men and women is among the issues already raised.
Women have thus far benefited from life insurance because they are less likely to be targeted for insurance companies.
"Next incredible ideas from the master EU people can compete until the end of this year.
Only the vote will take place by the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU's conflicting orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, resulting in damage to the environment, as well as the prohibition on the use of reliable raw materials only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of the tobacco cell, which has led to a significant increase in egg production this year.
Criticism has also led to a fact-finding ban on the use of the term "butercraft oil" or exclusion from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas shall be 10 inches long.
A European vehicle often decides under pressure from any other trade or industrial lobby, which is normally protected by a State or group of States in Brussels (which is even now subject to the threat of the weather) by Chechnya.
The interests of lobbying such as, for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not have the courage to show "anonymous crime".
At the same time, the European Commission was justified in harmonizing only the existing diverse national rules that have made trade difficult.
The EU, despite the opposition of some States, has still reduced standards on fruit and fruit, bearing in mind that existing directives will lead to cuts of products.
The candidate for the prize in the survey may also become an EU last year's decision that air-sellers should be obliged to warn that children under eight years of age cannot rely on them without the attention of adults.
The EU has referred to American studies in which air scars during the game are the potential cause of the death of children by breathing.
Such restrictions are now extended to children up to 14 years of age, who are prohibited from falling into arms.
Fun ideas are also born at home
It is too absurd to say that everyone in the EU who has any official position cannot use the name Macedonia, but must instead say "BURM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Free Economics, Laissez Faire, proposed voting in addition to the abovementioned absurd rules, such as the EU food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks available in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the levels of frozen flu, for which it suffered a great fine.
The prosecutor's organizers were also interested in the idea of paying to some countries what they had no sea and the idea of granting subsidies to a claim for grants.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are in poor condition, because we have no sea.
At the request of the European Union for compensation, " the Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CFP) said in August 2004.
As an argument, he indicated that there was a high yield in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stocks of stocks that had to be exported.
Because Czechia is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
At the same time, the European Commission met with the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Department of Regional Development, led by the Minister for Regional Development (US-DEU), invited the villages to receive grants, in particular, to make applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Excellent orders are the exception
While decision-making in Member States is easy to become the object of criticism, EU efforts to regulate and improve the functioning and development of the EU, many experts believe, are worth more.
The serious problem, experts believe, is that the EU's allocations to projects that are not even targeted at something in general with the deepening of European integration, but which have been achieved by Member States in the discussion of the budget.
It is the feeling among the Czechs and that, as in other European countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, which it does not always win in this meeting.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, maintained the name "Olomoukkas" but the "Tummian Roma" of our country's 19th-century tradition, our producers had to be renamed "Tuzemak".
It can only be called a roman, but not a sugarcane.
The official EU list of registered products, along with world-known "feta" and "gorgondzol" products, from the German Lubeca or Parmian promises, has already been made, for example, carlovar sugars, carrots and turbocanic carp and jattecium.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of the paradoxical ring and the burning drums.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a lover, Ocamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head of the president's position?
I don't think I'm going to be a senator or president.
If everything worked out without a problem in our country, I'd never have fought.
But I can't see how in the last 20 years the country has been developing, how it has grown, how it has grown, and how people have increased taxes and pensions.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been serving for 40 years, and I'm an independent person who doesn't belong to any party, I don't have any other chance to influence things except to vote for a senator or president.
You're burning in the Senate, but soon you're going to the presidential castle.
Will you not then turn to the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I would be involved in the fight against the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the elections in the Senate.
I explained later that if I were elected by the senator, I would vote in the presidents.
My goal is not to serve as a position, which is an instrument I can use to carry out my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and greater authority.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation have sex at the bar or on television, but also that we're ready to get rid of anyone who's trying to change something.
This is added to the media that divide people and lead to freedom of speech with freedom of speech.
For example, I was told that I'm going to give the reporters a receipt or that I was an adviser to Irji Paroubek.
Let's go look at you.
You have started the presidential closure of the political and criminal issues and the return of property statements over twenty million.
In order to do so, the law needs to be amended.
You do not have such authority as the President, and only the whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to handle this?
When I became a citizen, I was able to move on as a free enterprise.
The problem is in politics - when someone comes with a good offer to the left or right, there is a tendency to oppose him, and that keeps citizens from doing so.
As an independent independent person, I have a much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentarian parties.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without partying by hand, without looking at the ideals, and apply it.
Do you think you're a man more related to the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left-hand man.
It doesn't matter to me - a little left or a little right.
I think it's important for us to move forward.
It's not about someone who's right, but someone who's left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by the CDM or the GDP, and I will be exactly the same against the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove that what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or some of the experts are talking about them.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only be left with a lie.
And you won't stay in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you approach people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any choice.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to shift them to our side so that we can get ours.
If I had been elected as President, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television transmission, in which I would appeal to the Presidents of Parliament to legislate material and criminal responsibility for policies, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to report why they do not want to do so.
If there is a strong personality that causes abuse, pressure can be imposed on the political scene.
Take the President's direct election -- it was a public pressure.
I'm telling you, I'm a lover, not a genius, and I didn't understand.
I'm trying to look for allies to stop my beliefs and views.
I'm just beginning politics, and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I am trying to move forward on my own; in that case, if it fails, six years later, and I will return to the private sector.
This part of it sounds like Ocamura should save Chechia.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything, so I mixed up a number of famous people with a proposal to go to the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, and he gave up much work.
At the same time, I also supported the leading investigation by journalist Jan Lorenz, who discovered fraud with light-boiling petroleum products.
I've made my candidate because people are not really happy, but now I feel content.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, but most of those who were elected by the majority.
Only two of us in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will work.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct elections of mayors and governors.
You think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about this yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential member of the past, and I don't have the money.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account, only $2,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own cases going to be?
The personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a place in Prague worth about 25 million, a 10 million apartment, another 8 million square, a collection of art productions of about 10 million, Aston-Martin of 3.5 million and Scotland Superb of millions, and a few millions more.
Aston Martin's bones appeared to me because it was my little dream, and I always liked James Bond, who was riding in the car, was a galanite with women, and at the same time fought against subsistency and lawlessness.
You live in Aston-Martine, you own 60 million property and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors indicates that my programme is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-election campaign from my karman.
I'm actually in charge of the campaign.
But I wouldn't spend those money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't have fought.
So you're still going to work on a business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're reducing this activity?
But that doesn't depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I gradually reduced my activity.
For example, the director of the tourism agency will become my deputy.
People would like me to be a freeman who will preserve the Republic.
But I need something to live for, too.
How much as an entrepreneur you used to get every month?
From two to four thousand, which I still get.
And if I were to be president, my business would be over.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's issue of "Right".
The MVRDV architects demonstrate that these findings are not only in the view of Spain and its recently built Book Mountain 2 photos.
"I think this building is happy, it looks fantastic, and we can finally see something interesting again," said Lizette Verheig, passing along the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in the vicinity of the big business, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I'm asking myself, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is now willing to go to such old - fashioned libraries, is it?
Spain, a small town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, in order to combat this sad situation, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven enthusiast bridges that were painted on euro banknotes, as a biodegradable diamond miner.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only chance of losing statistics — to build a library here!
The Maas wines from the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, the master of bold columns charts and the author of ossormous, sometimes even of kinic structures, have been subjected to their usual insatiableness and appeared on a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and the face.
As soon as juries were carefully examined and fed, Dr. Maas composed his original prized gift and finished with the following words in defense of his project: "The considered thieves!"
Here's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spain, so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain grew to 30 million euros.
It is part of the project of revitalization, which also includes underground garages, supermarkets, mails and several housing and tonnhausques in total capacity for 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the "The Book Mountain" was noted as the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the 2012 national Dutch competition for timber weapons.
Thus, the endless prize that could previously have offered nothing but the post-Modern walking zone and an amazingly unpretentious rat, the white phases of which are thought to be milkwater, became more rich in a modern architecture.
But most importantly, in Spain there was the first public building of cultural destination in the history of this city.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cover for cheese.
There is only one elevator in the centre of the upper mass, because these worshipers of architecture and reading prefer to study this place by foot.
A light and light room is visible from all sides, the fields of the worship kilp and the elegant street forums inevitably create a sense of the public square.
The city environment is ideally restored.
The view is not uncommon for cats, dogs, and football players, boys and girls.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
"The bookstores usually stand in front of the façade, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually empty and empty," says Vini Maas.
We set up a classic space configuration with a leg on our head and set out the area to read inside the circle.
The interior of the mountain is used skillfully: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are available.
In particular, the black bookstores, which serve as the wall department, the parapets, and the wooden parlours, are enjoyed.
Their type, texture and smell are unusual.
Even tested architects and engineers are lost in the idea that this is for unknown material.
"We have tried to work with secondary materials," explains Job Trauborst, project leader representing the Spanish community, according to the standard.
And once on one farm in France, we met an appropriate agricultural product.
For many years in the heat and in the fields of the Netherlands, artificial metal metal millimetres have been used as floor coverings.
It's cheap and time.
The thin textile is served for one or two seasons, then it can be removed.
For libraries, this is a semi-trailer - first in such a way - was put in a tank panel of four inches.
Under the noise and pressure of the so-called Landbaoplastic (KLP), it is turned into a dark, unusual, solid material, at the smell of a little new car and a little cross.
The top is 105 degrees.
The person who passes a long distance of nearly 500 metres will be rewarded not only by the city’s fantastic appearance but also by the Dutch crochets and wooden figurines in the hills.
They are concerned about the atmosphere and, above all, about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs for a New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite the abundance of glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," said Troubost.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the mountain of the Book is below the glass floor, in clear daylight the sun is only a short period of time.
The shrubs of the clay tree, which are made up of perpendicular glass façade, provide shade and receive most of the sun’s benefits.
The air in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining guards are fully equipped with automatic wheelchairs.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned earlier, had already visited a new library.
Lisette Verheig was here too.
The traditional Chinese medicine teacher Sintia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of the Spaniards who had not been captured for a long time."
Reason: Within a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books were to be placed in empty boxes not yet fully complete, with 70,000 books at that time.
The idea worked.
The poles are placed on the roof.
"Nothing worse than a broken library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some connection with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she's only serving as a maid.
Thus, MVRDV was able to address the royal task, which is called the establishment of identity in the professional district.
Spain wrote its literature history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point to build identity.
To itself: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
In the view of Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, as such, Berlin is balanced on the shortest diplomatic route.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany began to understand that it had voted against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful with regard to its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being too critical in relation to Israel.
At the time of the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a prohibited zone for flights.
NATO thus made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, from which the United States has managed its own foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent single policy for Europeans.
Thus, Germans are re-examined between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they're just trying to figure out their role, but they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy of France or Great Britain.
What, in particular, does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is ready to take a position in national interests that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that Germany's foreign policy depends on economic policy, it is from exports and connections to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests differ significantly from the interests of other major States, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets for arrivals in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to disturb the public and elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't have given it too much importance, that's not a whole unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Did Germany violate its relations with the United States, refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the German position is overemphasized.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This clearly indicates that it should be recognized as an international game and that it should be considered to be of interest.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States had clearly stated that it was a widow.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European States?
Such differences have always existed under American internal policies.
I believe that the Obama Government has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
However, because of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences in opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you are considering the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyih, note that Obama is not at all in favour of Netanyah's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the status of the most important partner in the EU with the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, Germany would have a little easier if there were a single, non-conforming European policy, but not right now.
Therefore, they are unable to make a broader approach and are forced to act on their own understanding.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will play a leading role in developing a common European position.
Of course, that is not easy for Germany, even because of ties with Israel.
That theme was always vicarious.
But I think Germans clearly have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself in the role of an important international game, will it not play a key role?
Or does Germany still play a heavy role?
Germany has not yet been accustomed to this, it has always been unhappy and, for obvious reasons, it has always been difficult to play a significant role.
Let us consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany plays an important role, the most diverse anti-German feelings are expressed.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
Of course, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a far more serious position than the United States.
It should take into account the wide variety of neighbors and opinions, but that is not easy.
So the influence of the United States on European policy is constantly weakening, but at this moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who else remains?
Germany has just had to play a more important role.
Even if you do not like it, you may find it difficult to love it, or you may be tempted to hate it.
Stephen Sabo, Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, U.S.A., in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly study the problems of the Transatlantic Community.
In addition, Sabo is a member of the German Marshall Fund, which specializes in German policy, foreign policy of the United States and transatlantic relations.
"Protection of Good Signs" in China: when Puma and Armani will soon become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what about Armani Polo?
It is perfectly registered in China, which has nothing to do with companies from whom it has been taught.
However, it will be preserved until the owners of the original names have made a request.
But it still doesn't make sense if they can't stand their rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloh, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of the rights of trade marks in the Far East.
On my table every week, it appears in a new case like that.
Immigrants are sufficient to add a few letters to get the right to register their trade marks.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied.
The clipboard opens a folder with records of the Department of Registration of Good Marks in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, an artistic name also used for the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the champions of the world for copying and violating intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are multi-ethnic universes that sell almost exclusively commercially.
Pattloha, however, was not so; on the orders of his creditors, he protested that Chinese companies would be fully granted the right to use the name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it a minipa ban, a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "Ban docuan".
That's what women call a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize their guilt
"It damages business, it needs to be fought against," believed Pattloh.
"The trade mark is confused, the unique situation is gone, the moment is very painful."
Financial losses and procedural costs in affected industries are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA research company, China, with a sales of EUR 15 billion per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market of products.
However, the removal of suspicious records in the trade mark register is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
The defendants are talking about cases in which the court has rejected the claim, as after a long period of time, the contested term has become “real market”.
If he doesn't pull the trigger, he'll even have to pay the plaintiff, as his trade mark in China has damaged, says Patloh.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are also numerous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, a company that had recently acquired the company-producer of Putzmeister.
Therefore, Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The purchased Volvo company Geely first used the blue-white logo mentioned by BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of the fashion products Lacoste lost in China emimitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the so-called crocodile looked at the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that there was difficulties in 2010 due to lack of personnel and equipment.
In the past year, however, there has been “a return from the emergency situation in the labour process to the standard”.
Thus, the number of untreated cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
At the same time, 81.500 claims still await production in the agency.
It's worth fighting.
As is common in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trade marks applications, almost a third of them more than in 2010.
This record means that China has ruled a list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time, reports the Government.
The same applies to the total number of actual trade marks, totalling 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Junees were paid.
To simplify this means that each registration is between 1280 June or 160 euros.
It is much more likely to challenge her, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the conference has fought against the Chinese plagiarist.
Germany has been able to find out that their illicit production of separate car details has been eliminated.
However, the Imitator confirmed the Chinese right to trade mark Freudenberg.
This was a personal mistake, as families in Germany were not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities, Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration agency has rejected the mining claim.
It is true that Freudenberg won both of the following institutions, but the opposing party continues to fight at the same time.
Must be the beginning.
The issue is now under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commend the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is an emergency road and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Whether domestic costs are barely taken into account, the company's archives have even been subject to the centuries-old act to produce evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsustainablely proposed a "large six-point amount in euro" for settlement.
"It's clear from here how much we owe it," says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East are threatened even in Europe.
In that case, if the sponsors are registered there for unprotected trade marks.
Yes, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for leather and leather products.
The Concentration has long stopped production in these areas, but it has been able to prevent registration.
"There must be a beginning," says Ventzler.
Both he and Pattloh’s lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, rather, foreigners should “all that should somehow be protected, also registered in China,” says Ventzler.
Otherwise, this could be much more dangerous than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg has lost its trade mark drama in the last act, it will have to pay on the contrary the licensees for its own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we're pulled out of the market in the dispute segment.
World Day of AIDS: Touching, drinking, helping
In Heidelberge, Imbongi's horn is replayed, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland are happy to do so.
History of relations over more than 8733 kilometres.
In the beginning, the roofs of Cuba, basketball cruises, Danish boaters and male paddles are packed into the park floor and quickly found.
Two-three-four.
Only after that do they slowly raise the voices of the singers -- the altar, the bass, the tower, and the furnace -- they come and inspire and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old manager, doesn't seem to exaggerate from his mother-in-law tuffles when he takes them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, a new song is played in the Musical Hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Hidelberge Hor Imbonga.
Fifty participants were from 23 to 69 years of age, from genetic experts to the court.
"Om "Obani" is a simple thing, every voice of people has its own text in the same language as in a perfectly foreign language: a zero million people speak in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme is estimated to have approximately 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 per cent of the population is positive.
For 180 orphans, AIDS in the Forestry Association Voices for Africa was found chief in Germany.
Seventy-seven of them attend a school that is ready for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take care of yourself.
It guarantees a child's money at school, school form, and daily hot dinner at Gogo Centre.
Imbumbongs in the Zulu language mean a speaker or a admirer.
They don't talk about flying in the bathroom, so they're capable of singing.
Almost ten years ago, the choir learned songs in this foreign tongue, and from time to time even brought them back to where they first appeared: in South Africa.
At 8733 kilometres from Haydelberg, in the northwestern part of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitani, which depends on the voices of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some of whom still live in simple hygienics from clay and sand, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them survived without parents who died from HIV infection.
In Esiten, the ministry reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF data.
The elimination of the minimum wage for men, which is evidenced to reduce the risk of half-life injury, is almost unacceptable among the population.
More than half of the population in Swaziland is infected with immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but previously the Imbogni participants saw a number of children on the streets, not only of parental care but also of all: food, clothing, education.
Without education in the poor, there are no chances.
In the beginning, it was a private obligation for individual participants - for several euros a year to send a child to school and allow him to get hot food once a day.
But a year ago, however, the Voices for Africa was founded, which has been almost professionally concerned about AIDS outbreaks in Essitania.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial IPP includes syphilis, chlamidosis and tripper (gonorium).
IPP is often HIV, human papilloma virus, genetic herpes and hepatitis.
Pediculose and frequency are related to parasitic IPP.
What are the main vulnerable groups?
Siphilis and honours are met mainly with men who have sex with men.
Robert Koha's Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany resulting from sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often encounter sexually transmitted diseases, include chlamid infections, trichomonia, candidosis (grabock), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, the HDL infections are much more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three fourths of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
We are also often confronted with human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis ’ disease, according to Robert Koha Institute, has doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
There were some 2700 cases in 2011.
It's about a decade less than in the past year.
What are some symptoms of venous disease?
Infectious diseases, there may be genetic defects, complaints of rape, surrender, life-threatening pain, as well as nausea or vomiting.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Conservatives are able to reduce the risk of injury but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent exchange of sexual partners.
In the early diagnosis, most PPPs can be treated and avoided from the side effects.
The leadership, donations, and not least the public speakers throughout Germany, allow something to be collected.
"We have already sent to Essitania about 200,000 euros," said Annete Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the village of Zódva Dláni, a conscious and active woman is in charge of money from Germany.
She will also care for the well-being of the orphans, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call old women, is a forest monster.
Some of them took up to 14 orphanages, gave them a head covering, and cared for the children’s daily appearances.
Those who are not related to their families arrive at Hannishle, the only woman who receives a union payment, as well as two couples who prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a Swedish school, built two smokers, and, together with the American Health Organization, organized HIV analysis for many rural people.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so obvious in the whole country prefers to be deeply silent.
The King With 14 Women
"Spid is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lennartz, "because it's related to sex."
It is unusual for a country in which the king is officially 14 women.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Msvati III, is known for his love of excellence.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the life- style of such a licensed State is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in the past year.
But it is also on ships that spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annete Lennartz, "but they're almost useless.
The second culture is flat."
To support a little cultural exchange, Ibmongni has been traveling to South Africa every two and a half years and has been singing, full of songs, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the southern part of the black continent have known since the apartheid.
A bus, full of whites, who sing songs in black language, not only brings good mood and joy, but also, in fact, tears on the faces of hard frontiers.
The trip is also always taken to Essitania, where some visitors visit the children of the underprivileged.
Although a small village with work can be found on the map, it is more famous in the Eculvena Valley.
"Go to Essitania, there is the world," people say.
And after an 8733-km flight back to Haydelberg, when the steamers return to the restaurant on Bergheimer Street, you can see that the light is burning here too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurii
The Messenger's probe found evidence of the ice on the planet of Mercuri.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Agency of the United States has proved the existence of ice on the planet of Mercuria.
Although it is located close to Solenza, there is also freezing water, as is seen in three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger's probe found evidence that the constant presence in the dark region of the planet is covered by ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 cm, possibly up to 20 meters.
It is assumed that water comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that have met with Mercuri.
No one connects the opening of the Earth with the existence of the planet, said the science director of the Shawn Solomon Zone.
The temperature in Mercuria can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life have fallen into other parts of the solar system.
For earth’s inhabitants, telescopes and small works, such as Fenix, are studying the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they are sent to the earth of images: small clouds in endless valleys.
The picture comes from cameras developed by German researchers from Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the celestial planets.

The photo of the space telescope "Habble" shows the fragment of the darkness of Iris in the Ceféa constellation.
The darkness of 1400 light years is part of the dust, which is 10 to a hundred times less than the normal domestic dust.
This picture was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a number of black species, which were removed for 430 million light years from the Earth.
This Galactic Group, called Arp 273, photographed the NASA space telescope Hubble for NASA.
Scientists call it UGC 1810.
In this constellation there is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The constellation is constantly creating new stars.
It is the star cloud, which is also associated with the darkness of Rosetak, and is constantly creating new stars, at 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright light, light galaxies with little black air still don't have dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when there was mainly water in the universe.
Our Views in the Universe: Main telescopes
Likely, telescopes were invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem — still before Galileo started observing stars in the year.
From that time onward, optical telescopes have become more and more accessible to their view of space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the telescope "Hale" in the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The circle here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., a large binocular telescope was established.
It allows space to be seen using two circles, each diameter of 8.4 meters.
Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - a diameter of just one circle is 10.4 meters.
The circle of the Great South African Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce cost.
However, in the diameter it reaches about ten meters.
The lack of a small structural performance: the telescope is heavily reinforced under the vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The telescope "Hobbi-Eberley" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its specificity: high lighting capacity.
It achieves -- despite relatively small circle diameter -- the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to ground signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the project “Research for Foreign Minds” (SETI), any computer owner can assist by providing its accounting capacity.
Type of observation of the European Astronomy Service (ESO) in the Czech Andeans.
There's a great telescope here, which is entirely consistent with its name.
Its four sercules allow light to shine in the eye tube even in the middle of the infrared spectrum.
The ESO also plans to establish a European Large Telescope Eye.
Its main circle must be broken down at a total of 42 meters, and it will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements.
However, photographs should be expected not earlier than 2018.
By 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaii Mauna Kea volcano were considered the world's biggest.
They have two spheres of diameter of ten meters.
The Kek telescopes are composed of the Mauna-Kea observatory, which, together with them, is also seen in the sky with the Subaru telescopes and the IRTTF.
In addition, a new giant telescope must appear on Mauna-Cea with a circle of 30 meters.
Here they can be liked for illustrations.
However, the most important species of space is the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has been drawings of far-reaching worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope "Kepler" has been looking for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life can be possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidates had been identified from the start of the mission.
The photographs have been printed in recent preparation of the space telescope "Kepler".
The space telescope James Webb (JWST) will be sent to space by 2018 on the Aryan 5 rocket.
The main circle of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of telescopes is that it should search for a great explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists estimate that the south Pole of Mercuria is ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger is returning close to the northern half of the planet.
Radar targets for decades have shown that there is ice in Mercuria.
Thanks to the Messenger zone launched in 2004 - the first one that is coming back to the area of Mercuria - scientists are now convinced.

The trip through the Tales Mountains can be called a dicy and romantic.
The microwave is floating along the high road despite the harsh forests of holms, bushes, and simple crestian homes.
All around you is so green and bright that you can think of being in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few miles from here.
They live here - one of the Kavkaza people who knows little about it - only what they talk about in Paris and Azerbaijan and stand out for a long time.
The end point is Leric.
The small town is surrounded by a very heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not fully harmonize with the lively mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tired.
The distance is eight hours, as the road has a total area.
The legendary wealth the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea here in the province before it was recovered.
However, Pilate Fatuleva (48) is convinced that there is more interest in the tourists in Lerika.
"In May Baku celebrated the Festival of Songs of Eurovision - and next year we will be the Festival of Older People of Peace," says Fatuleva.
She's the director of a long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biography is documented here in about eight dozen of these places, more than 100 years old. Fatuleva refers to a black-white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's been here for 120 years.
At 136 years of age, he had another child
The museum, however, is the Chaban Shirali Mussulmov, which has been completed for 168 years.
The evidence of birth, however, is not.
In view of the fact that the older man, whose age has been confirmed by documents, was completed by 122 years, the age of Islam is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatuleva.
A man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and he was 136 when he had a daughter.
Has the Muslim tab added a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholtz, an adult researcher from Max Plank Institute in Rostok, heard about the debt in Central Asia.
" Too many people of advanced age can also meet in some areas of China, Japan or the Huns Valley in Pakistan," Scholtz says, "there are also very old people in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of documents, age science cannot be confirmed as there were no civil status registers.
Every day a bottle of hot oil
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the area of Lerika are often quite elderly.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijani explorer Farid Mugimzade explains this to special genes.
The director of the Fatulava Museum, on the other hand, believes the food business.
People like meat, bread, and most of the milk products, many of them drink hot oil every day, but not even such high - calorie diets can be healthy with a diathetological view.
Or is it a matter of early life that keeps people young? In Chengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzoeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she was still relatively young to those extended.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on a field with a bottle of oil that's not standing around here.
Under one cross are eight people, including one of Mirzay’s sons and daughters, who have had their grandchildren for a long time.
And there's a couple of little ones flying around.
Guests are prepared to make tea, which is offered in typical wooden stanzas of the army.
At Mirza's ideal level and firm white teeth, under her head, she cuts the long dark-haired hair that her son proudly uncovers before us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell and kept the color.
"And I never used the champagne," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly Pension Takes On Life
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, pools, potatoes, vegetables.
For the rest of my life, I never bought any products in the store.
Then she tells of her husband, who served in the army.
It was more difficult after World War II.
But it's better when "the loving father" Geider Aliev got up in a role.
The propaganda does not often sound like the words of an old woman.
However, the culture created around the figure of the father of the nation, whose country rules as a dictator, in Azerbaijan actually do not know the boundary.
He was in power until 2003, and then he received his son Ilham.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elders.
230 coins (about the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions it is a good living.
And perhaps the oldest son of Mirza is also entitled, "The history of our culture is deeply respected."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by worry and happiness.
Why not stay alive as long as possible?
The word “human rights” is not found in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Controversial demonstrations in Cairo testify to the country's profound dispersion.
The future constitution based on charismaticism has met with a bitter resurgence.
The Egyptian president didn't gather at the paphos.
We must create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility for the people and God," he said on public television.
His words were addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian bishops, liberals, educated Muslims, and nonreligious Egyptians.
All of them, who are still hopelessly disappointed in the disintegrated opposition, experience fear.
Fear of the religious state in the Nile on the mercy of the powerful "Brother of Muslims".
Mohammed Mursey, although not forgiving, said that he temporarily challenged the constitutional jurisdiction of the court and expanded his jurisdiction, "to save the revolution."
However, in fact, the 61-year-old engineer, who is a doctor at the University of South California, wants to save himself, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the power of the judiciary be lost?
In fact, 234 articles were able to pass on a 15-hour escape at night with restrictions on the Islamic constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this was partly a threat.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft states that court proceedings are based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was also the case of interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use the extensive wording and the legal gap for a more rigorous interpretation of the spell.
At the very least, this is a new article: in all cases concerning the Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country, which is used by the greatest authority in all Sunni Islam, should be attracted to the Council.
This should not be done, but it can mean that the Government is monitoring legislation that would, in fact, result in a limitation of judicial authority.
The draft Constitution contains many elements of interpretation
Another problem is that civilians should remain subject to the military court.
These courts during the period of Mubarak's authorities served as opposition officers.
After the assassination of the dictator, there were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State must protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “support its moral and values”.
It is legally formulated so little that public institutions can control even the content of cinema and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
Not one article sets out the exact equality of men and women at all.
That is why the Messenger of Allah and His Messengers have been charged with hardship.
However, such harassment and how it should be punished remain unclear.
There is also doubt about the wording that "people's harassment" is prohibited.
Will there be enough characters for the president or a joke on the board of law?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, proposed by Mursi on the signature, which, in his words, would be presented to the Egyptians at the referendum.
"The revolution has come back."
The opposition against the superiority of Islam has already been formed for several weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in an extraordinary assembly on Friday evenings at Tahrir Square in Cairo and tried to destroy this document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
Laurent of the Nobel Peace Prize and former leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El Baradei, said that the draft Constitution was a place for "the collapse of history".
Through a short news service, Twitter has accused Mursi's commitment to lead "the fight against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we'll go to his court and take him away," said oppositioner Yasser Said.
"We have not yet stopped, the blood of our brothers has not been recovered," the Egyptian media quoted the mass information of opposition policy Haled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to watch the referendum, which would make it ineffective.
"The Koran - Our Constitution"
The well-organized "Muslim Brothers", in turn, called for opposition, but, cautiously, not on Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
She attended a large number of women under the cover of the salafists who cried out: “The people are demanding the application of God’s law.”
They needed Mursey, "Purify the country!" and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area, at which all had begun, led to the state of virtually civil war.
Detective Mursey, obviously, didn't want to take this risk.
“Muslim brothers” stated that both the opponents and the sponsors of the draft constitution were expressed in a loud and clear voice.
Now is the time to allow the people to decide in the electoral forum where the country should go.
Most of the Islamic projects are considered decisive.
"Human rights are never mentioned"
Hafiz Abu Saeda, in light of this forced constitutional process, which, in general, had to be extended until February with all the public forces involved.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ECHR) protected the “Brother Muslim” when they were in or before the court in Mubarak.
Not because he has divided their world views, but because human rights are not equal to him.
That's why he was shot, convicted, arrested.
And now the word "human rights" is never met in the new constitution, he regrets the discussion with "Well am Sontag".
The expansion of the influence of Mursi on all three winds in the State discourages the lawyer.
These measures are a clear violation of the democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
" Instead of strengthening the civil state, the President de facto cancelled it," Saeda regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot operate.
It is now felt that everything left him, even the international community that looks at the ideological struggle for the path to the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and enthusiasm.
That's why you can pay for it.
A protester at Tahrir Square warns: "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norway's Recife: the world's dumbest fish?
In the 5 million people of Norway, one of the highest levels of life is not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Is it possible that the country's success is somehow linked to a local approach to an extremely violent fish blouse?
Take a few slices of fresh cheese.
Put them in a bag of green and soft sports clothes.
Leave them there for a few weeks.
You'll have a devastating smell of raffic sand, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacys.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air, it's an unexplainable natural smell.
Raqfisk is a salt-stained furnace and a water-borne vessel, depending on which spirit is to be gained.
As the summers and the cold come to an end, the Norwegians are gathered at the Fagernes festival on the same subject, so to speak.
"It eats raw and drinks a cup of water, a local dark water," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local fireman on the profession and on the partnership of the Recife General, who is leading the festival.
People around us eat little fish and drink it with small portions of spirit.
"Someone likes water more than raffic," Howard says.
It's a drink that can keep smelling.
I'm trying a couple of cookies.
If you can get a knife under your nose, it's not that bad - it's a little different than the piece of dry that you've been driving in the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when before the colders appeared, the fish was trapped in German-closed shells with salt water.
Then, when the fish had already been well and thoroughly contaminated, it was pulled out and, by the smell of alcohol, used in food.
In the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to immigrate mainly in the United States.
At present, the population has grown to more than 13 per cent, with immigrants entering the workplace, high wages and the development of the social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (a former rival and not yet a much more profitable neighbor) have come here to work.
Raqfisk is understood as an important symbol, an irreplaceable symbol, even though a number of violent elements of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local flowers.
On the other hand, all the way here - a little beer or sandwich will cost you nine pounds of sterling ($14).
Norway is rarely seen in the world news, and most of the country's inhabitants seem to be shocked.
The name Anders Breyvik, a racist and extremist of the right, is still widely mentioned in the past year by 77 men, women and children who have been shot and killed.
Without mentioning his name, the chart is called "the 22 July event".
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that one of their citizens in their country of peace has been capable of such animals and killings.
The present prosperity of Norway is based on the growth (from the beginning of the seventeenth) of one of the world's largest oil industries.
“But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says our officer Anna, who differentiates between relations with a durable raffic, a woman with long-light hair and suddenly deep-sighted eyes, the abuse of normal well-being.
We are a people who are called by your name.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English more beautifully.
We don't like to show up, we're not proud.
Norway is very careful with its oil, and most of the oil industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis when all the money that had not been spent was carefully taken into account by Norway.
"Peace can fall on winter beds and walk in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a raffic," she adds with an anxious smile.
I'm in the snow for something else - a raffle with me.
There's a hamburger with a lot of meat. It's an exact exotic, delicious meat.
But tonight we're waiting for more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel, special tasks are carried out on rape, during which visitors determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a direct teleefer that shows the lead in the bottle of a buggy surrounded by raffic plates.
It's like a song competition on Eurovision.
"So, Tor-Yurgen, what assessment have you put for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our evaluation."
They all laugh and cry.
Someone's falling out of a chair, maybe I've picked up some water.
And maybe it's just the smell of that fish.
President of Mexico Enrique Pjej Newe is facing a difficult career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Nuté, is preparing to enter the post, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he has to face and the mixed expectations of his people.
Road movement in Mexico is now in a special state of crying.
The city was overloaded by transportation and in the best possible time, and from Monday there were standing raids, which had been transferred to the capital and caused chaos on the streets.
However, this was not done in order to prevent people from working on the prizes and to mix protestors into parliament building.
The new head of Mexico, Enrique Nîa Nété, will wish to join the presidency and take the country's government seriously.
There's a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has received good economic indicators at the administration of Felipe Calderona, which is now exercising its powers, but the country has been involved in the fight against drugs, which has taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares to the people of Mexico its willingness to fight violence,” Mr. Pjeja Newe told President Barako Obama earlier this week at the White House headquarters.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, the political career of Mr. Pjeja Nito, with the President of the United States, had developed as the governor of his country of Mexico.
His family, in a densely populated and broad state around the capital of the country, shared the views of the new leader.
A straight-line man
In the idyllic city of Valé de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
The population is responsible for the survival of tourism, the development of the Kurt area and the establishment of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new shelves built by Mr. Pjeja Nito, which are different from the roads with the fugitives and the areas that were previously in this place.
Tables with its name refer to the modern building of the sports centre and the impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are in touch with him for real and serious changes," said his friend and political associate, Gabriel Oliver Ernards, Congressman of the Head of the Ninth Institute-Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to these and decisive changes that our country so desperately needs, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After the permanent residence of the PRI party in the year 81, it was excavated in 2000 by Vice-President Fox.
Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12-year absence at the Los Pinos Presidential Court, the party has given much hope to Enrique Pjena Nito.
In addition, he questioned the inconsistencies that had caused the new opposition president.
He is very straightforward and very generous in his vision of a future country.
He is an outstanding public worker, and, above all, a man of skill to listen.
However, in another part of the state, many people had another idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nassaualkotoll, also known as Ciudad Ness, is the most frequent contrast with the powerful streets of Valé de Bravo.
In many ways, it is a reward for Mexico itself.
And the problems in municipalities are also a serious nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, the armed forces had been involved in the calming of drug trafficking gangs in these areas; violence against women was particularly severe here.
In the desert, only a few tens of dead women have been found in the area for the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the rule of Mr. Pjeja Nutt - a significant increase in the notorious violence in the city of Ciudad-Houres, whose name became a criminal when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to Mr. Pjeja Nito, he could best be said that he was unable to deal with the murder of women while he was in his position as governor.
In the latter case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
The concrete housekeeper, who seems to be most of the houses in the surrounding area, is working to keep track of her daughter, Mariana Luna, taking pictures of her daughter.
According to Mariana's official version, suicide took place in 2010.
However, her family thought she had killed her partner.
"When I came to her house, it seemed like her body had already disappeared," said Mrs. Budden.
There were signs of her being killed, and the body was already broken.
Mariana's mother rephrases this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where she looks at a series of crossword puzzles on which one word is based: justice.
That is, they say, the family was rejected.
"The officials of the state spoke to me as with an old net, not a sufficient breach of peace.
They want people to simply accept everything they say and reduce it.
But that's not true, especially when there are so many violations and irregularities," she says.
In hopes of a presidential transfer on Saturday, President Pjeja Nutto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence crimes, and the new President has promised to address this problem as a priority during his rule.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the governor," says Oliver, a Congressman from Valé de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is the most dangerous of victims' families in the City of Ness.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, accused him.
The prosecutors are trying to challenge Bradley Manning ' s statement on the bad conditions of detention.
During the hearing, attention was paid to the presence of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection is required to close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manninga's detention were cruel.
The United States Army is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents.
On Friday the charges were tried to prove that a number of Bradley Manning, accused of the largest theft of stolen materials in the US history, had not been used by many of the possibilities to complain of ill-treatment, which he said had to be transferred to military prison.
During a cross-examination hearing in Fort-Mid, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Feinn stated that the records of weekly visits to Manning to the prison administration by representatives of his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the request for the closure of the case of Manning on the basis of the fact that the conditions of his detention were cruel and self-deployed, was held the following day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
The Military Specialist for the Analysis of Explosive Data, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents during Iraq's service.
These materials were later published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports completed after the visits of the representatives of the administration of Manning during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under the strict detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Dr. Feinn asked on Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that he appreciated the treatment of himself by the prison administration as “precious” and the general conditions of the detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports considered do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, he claims.
Manning replied that he expressed his deep concern about these issues and that his representatives who visited him discussed these issues with him and said that they would do so, but not in writing.
"They've written "no problems" (after my complaint is discussed), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this issue in the sitting," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain of having been treated unjustly in January 2011 at a meeting of the Commission which considered the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that at the meeting he wanted to get rid of the regime of "traumatic prevention" and mitigated the conditions of the conclusion.
The military leaders explained that the limited detention regime, at a lower level than the control regime, for the prevention of suicide, was introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that with me everything in order to cancel the regime of prevention of traumatism... to improve the level of my life, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to prison at the military base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness because of his violent temper.
He explained that psychologically difficult when you don't know how your participation is resolved and what's happening in the outside world.
"My world was sorry for the base of Camp Arafjan, before the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, he spent most of his time in a small room, at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours in a single room.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only matras, clothes, shoes, a couple of clothes and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, such as to sleep or even to sit down at a certain time.
As Manning said, during his dream, there was always a light shining through the camera.
If the defenders did not see his face when he went to sleep at night, they would certainly have made him stumble and turned their backs.
Maninga's lawyer filed an official complaint about the abuse of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he had made during the fourth week, that after one night he had been forced to sleep in his room in Quantico, he was forced to stand before the guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning said he had no way of hiding his clothes during the inspection.
Responding to the questions of the judge on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the lawyer's order that he should wear a garment that could be covered, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to burn it.
On Thursday Manning said that last night he was forced to sleep deep because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not in danger of being in danger.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a trolley or slippers to hurt himself, but didn't do it.
That night, as Manning witnessed, his lower white, slender, and eyebrows were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least, will take into account what had happened to him during the time of his arrest and will significantly reduce the time of his arrest if Manning is recognized by the guilty military court, which should begin his trial at the beginning of the following year.
Protection stated that it was planned to propose that Manning should be held guilty of less serious crimes and that other charges should be dealt with as excessive.
Renewal of hearings is planned for these exits, and the accused party is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of prisoners with a maximum rigid regime.
Among the charges raised by Manning are the fraud of the opponent, the illegal promotion of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defence, and the acquisition of public property or documents.
If he is convicted of all the elements of the indictment, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of their lack of ability to realize themselves.
The Mexicans are willing to blame those who have left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are divided between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico, I traveled by corridor for visitors, approached the border control area, and shot at the spot.
The signs were indicated on two lines: one for Mexicans (Mexicos), one for Foreigners (foreigners).
I've been standing before them for a few seconds, I don't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called a Mexican for the rest of my life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York consider themselves Italian.
Later, I stood on the complex structure of the American American of Mexican origin.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than in language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and I got in line for Extrajeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pjeya Neto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was used to meet the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pjeja Nuto spoke enthusiastically about the support of the Mexican economy, which now enables Mexicans to remain in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade block like the Euro Union.
In addition, President Pjeja Nuto promised to continue the war against drug dealers in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
Mexico ' s relationship with the United States is a difficult and fulfilled attempt on the elderly.
Most Americans had never imagined that in 1848 the United States had entered Mexico and under the yoke of wine had forced its leaders to abandon half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see memories of those events everywhere.
Therefore, it is only a matter of silence for any US State actor to express any criticism of Mexico, the press and the elite of the Mexican society that the Americans are under the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the Montesum descendants are filled with war.
Mexico's relationships with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States are the most complex.
You want to talk about trying?
They're enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who are in this country for themselves and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Geneva or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for just one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone - a father or a grandfather - had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to move north.
Most of all, it was Mexicans of a certain type - soft, under-educated, poor crestian families.
We're their descendants, and we'll remember about that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our life is a set of American dreams, we've learned in good schools and built on good work, but let's not forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is misleading and unclear, but we know what country we think it is.
United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer the same question.
They remind us of humiliating injuries, and they apply to us as people of the second generation, as to the current Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Only our existence for them is doomed to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have escaped.
We would not be in a wheelchair now, finding a stable life in the United States, but we would lose our spiritual relationship.
My wife was born in Guadalahare and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me of the fact that there are certain trainings among Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and that is difficult for Mexicans.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Mexican Americans do not feel any belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springs.
If you get the best out of the two worlds, you're definitely losing your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I have explained during my trip, as if our relations were not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intelligence representatives want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans of origin to work their own way through Mexico's messages and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country is and how to visit it well, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
There's nothing going on.
Too much effort in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the fight against corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is such a beautiful one.
I'm sorry, but you're getting the same thing, Amigo.
And that's fair.
If part of the Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States for their failure to join the Mexican Politor centuries ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still trying to get together with their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
Please, we have more general than I've been told.
Old Battles in New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group can be a weak foundation for further peace
Can a lasting peace be enjoyed between Arab and Israelis in the Middle East?
The regular flow of blood transfusions leads to the conclusion that such hopes are valid.
It seems that the usual, unintended disputes about who first started; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians were killed, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; first during the conflict in the Gaza Strip, the rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Despite Israel and the Palestinians were hopelessly involved in their eternal conflict, however, changes had taken place in the Middle East.
This can be seen in a different light, but the events of the Arab cloud have surrounded many of the realities that lie ahead, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to remain on the side of the drought in the region.
As a result, their fight may become even more bloodthirsty than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope for the end of this deadly trap.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the prevailing situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement signed on 21 November will be implemented, which took place this week, only strengthened the position of the two parties.
The leaders of the Islamic Movement Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim that they urged Israel to give up despite their losses.
Despite the destruction of some of the leaders of the groups and the 1.7 million inhabitants were blocked in one of the most hostile and troubled corners of our planet, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas has increased its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River — another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the Fath movement.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders may come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As Islamist movements in the Arab world grew, Hamas developed new influential and rich friends.
The growing regional leader of Turkey, who was once the closest Union of Israel to Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The supporters of Hamas claim to establish an Israeli Islamic semi-monthly circle, from Lebanon to the north, in which the armed group of Hezbollah, to Syria, where more and more pro-Islamic rebels are under attack by Basar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities threaten Hamas' allies.
The most significant change in the balance of force in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in Egypt, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, where the influence of the Movement of the Muslim Brethren was strengthened with President Muhammad Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who has been bound by Egypt for 30 years in 2011, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas' support.
The Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In the future diplomatic districts of Hamas, it can be a big game that the voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, the parties to the hard line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military, Hamas was executed.
The Israeli anti-attacking system " The Fireball" has justified the cost of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas rockets.
Israel’s citizens can sleep peacefully at least for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained loyal to its fixed position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence in Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Binjamin Netanayeh, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although, since 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets released from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of death terrorists, partly because of the wall that goes into the West Bank of the Jordan, a significant part of the unknown Palestinian State, and protects Jewish populations that continue to expand despite the illegality of such acts from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyihu, whose party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, joined with more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Abigail Liberman.
What did it mean to create Palestinians and give them their own State?
If they were to surrender all authority to the West Bank, would they not begin to launch rockets from there in Israel, as did their meetings in the Gaza Strip?
It would be better to keep them under the wall and to force any attempts to raise their heads.
It is possible that the party will win; however, their calculations may be distorted by the Arabic flag.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not experience the warmest feelings of Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of the budget of Israel is greater than all its Arab neighbours, together with those taken.
The development of war with the regional superpower would hardly help the Governments of the Arab countries to strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of Egypt's President, Mursi, who worked with Barak Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and can be seen as the beginning of a change.
Israel, at least, must take into account the long-term implications of its policy.
As democratic change takes place in Arab countries, the denial of the right of Palestinians to self-determination is a bomb of slow action, which is either early or late in the occupied territories of Israel, such as the bus station in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension of the growing Arab population is only exacerbating these problems.
Blood-thirsty operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip for the forced movement of Hamas have to be paid for increasing international discontent.
Both sides need an external force
The only solution remains to which health-care representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are the education of two States and Israel's accession to the territory in exchange for security.
Hope is not too strong in the short term - it is hoped that the cease-fire will make other countries more effective to the side of the conflict.
Egypt, which had long decided to close arms supply in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, had never had a useful position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State, which had been adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fath movements.
This would be more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
The role of Israel in building the negotiating table must also be played by President Obama.
During his first term, he did not introduce his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Following his return to the White House, he continued to show a refusal to join in the resolution.
It's a catastrophic invisible position.
The United States is interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, a unified cigarette package law entered into force.
Prevention of smoking and imagery of affected parts of the body is given in contrast to isolated green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first international law on a single pack of cigarettes and tobacco products was introduced into force by replacing the logos and colouring of different brands of the same colour with yellow images of the disease of the body and images of children affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions that warn against the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages entered in the mandatory order from this Saturday is the names of the marks printed in the same small font.
These are the worst conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, without this harmful habit of fashion status.
Based on such a decision, the results of studies showed that people who did not start smoking at the age of 26 never became smokers in 99 of the 100 cases.
“It is obvious that even in youth children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring in with the preparation of packages,” explains Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies showing that, for example, the roots of lying are associated with children with the idea of princess.
Australia is one of the world's lowest smokers countries, so these changes are not particularly addressed to transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which dairy and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences that are different from those that were thought of by its sponsors,” says Scott Macintor, a representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
China and Indonesia producers will place a lot more of such goods for sale in Australia's streets.
On the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portfolios and silica fotules covering unpleasant images on packages has grown (actually with zero) more than two months ago, such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, has lost the case in a high court in Australia where they tried to appeal to this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented some 6,000 products to commercial enterprises and is expecting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential mix for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among them, namely that of the population to which they are directed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal advertising of cigarettes and support for sports activities, as well as bans on salers, the advertising of tobacco products has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited local companies and websites from placing advertising on the network, but it cannot restrict this foreign website.
"If you're selling tobacco products and you're left alone with this little laser, the idea of moving your product on the Internet will prove to be very misleading," explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Frimen notes the increase in the number of reviews on brands written by both ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the case of a rare citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he does not waste his energy and time and makes a video, or does he have a advertising company?
Australia's British American Tobacco Office claims that the industry is now making more adjustments to new rules than to advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to dispute new rules: these States make claims within the World Trade Organization, declaring that trade has been unfair, despite the fact that all these countries' trade relations with Australia are very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada first introduced a mandatory placement of anti-smoking photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of law enforcement is discussed in Britain, New Zealand, the United States and India.
The majority of smokers in Australia are not demonstrably influenced by innovations.
These pictures don't matter to me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just pick up the cigarette and put a pack in the carman," explains Victor El Haeg, who bought cigarettes with a photo of the mouthpiece on the bag.
I'm telling the truth, the only thing that can keep me going is my little girl.
James Yu, who holds the King of the Pack at the heart of Sydney, claims that the same package has made it difficult to distribute goods by fields
"I used to have a new party, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and prohibit cigarettes altogether, and then we would say, "All right, we're closing the store," he said, raising his hands up.
In the world of electronic networks and permanent connections, that is not so bad.
On that day of thank you, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical defects and replaced it with other planes we were waiting for.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of honey.
I won't lie to you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for the train is really boring, and there are no books, magazines, iPhones, or even free trade stores.
In recent times, however, more and more scientists and child development specialists have benefited.
They say that in certain situations we and our children are less likely to get hurt and worse.
This causes the brain to draw attention to interesting related topics, which may contribute to creation.
And because in today's world, we're all always in front of a screen, the benefits of shoes are coming from us.
Maybe we should try to jump?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll be back.
I used to think, as many have, that the dog was a little bit of a recent invention when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history of the University of Calgary, author of the book "Intrepid History of Skulls" (Boredom: A Level History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, it can be a very ancient story," he says.
The walls of the Pompey have found Latin inscriptions of the first century.
The question of how we understand the shoe remains open.
The problem is that John D. Ishitid, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, says that understanding and vision of dogs has often changed.
Having studied research materials on this subject and asked the task force a question of 100 people, Professor Ishitid and his colleagues came to the conclusion that it was a shock when people "wanted but could not take care of what would bring them satisfaction".
The difference between the dog and the pet, he says, is that the jumper does not do anything he wants to do.
There's nothing you want to do when you're hungry.
Mainly in the survived drought, he says that it is “a violation of attention and related deterioration of the mood and feeling that the time is now slowing down”.
The shock can be described as a very similar to depression.
However, Professor Iimidad argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, people who suffer from problems in the world and in the circumstances, and people who experience depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think it's boring when we're actually just trying to focus on something.
In his study “Immediate Understanding: Determination of the Eyebrows From Attention”, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Işidad and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment by which participants listened to the recording of the vote in the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds that were not related to the TV program in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so they could hardly be discussed, and the third group heard only a recording of voices without a sidetrack.
The participants who listened to a low volume television noticed that they had a low volume of noise and that it was often difficult for others to focus, but they did not know why and did not sign it.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption may cause shock, says Mark J. Fenceke, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Gwelfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something interesting, "e.g. looking at convergery products in search of a marriage, music can help to avoid shocks."
It is believed that when people start to climb on a table or paint a cigarette on a book list, they do it out of their pockets, but now we know that such actions are actually just helping not to weaken physically.
“The study showed that children who are not prohibited from driving and returning are learning better and forgetting more information than children who are required to sit quietly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all have a taste: at the end of the journey (as in my case), listening to a monotonous thing, watching an interesting movie.
However, different people demonstrate different degrees of skeletal resistance.
In the 1980s to measure these individual characteristics, researchers developed a special "square" scale.
Many of the things I have to do are used to define this scale, such as "I have to do something equally monotonous" or "I'm too interested, because I don't have enough time".
With the help of such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are getting more girls, says Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly with different external players.
In general, however, adolescents are often more prone to fall.
In 1991, Reid Larson, a professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was associated with the pager with nearly 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
It had the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said that they were good at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bad at school.
Only 3% of parents noticed that they were unhappy.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data would be about sugar now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “in the age of adolescence, there is a tendency to fall into shock” mainly because children and adolescents are not fully able to decide what to do.
Let's go back to my first question: is it useful?
Sometimes no, because in extreme manifestations, it may lead people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to break free from smoke.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers were concerned about the link between magic and creation, says Professor Vodanovic, who devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us that something else should be done; it's a shock," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this brain does not always know what to do.
If you're going to be bored and you're going to put this energy on the guitar or culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you get to watch TV, it'll be better for you for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child jumps and you give him an iPad, he'll stop jumping, but he won't learn to fight a bitch alone or somehow manage his time and his job, says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulatory skills are in many different situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to take care of himself but also to exercise self - control at all.
I don't think I need to carry a shoe.
But it's not worth considering something bad.
It is time to learn to feel comfortable even beyond the constant flow of action and technology.
Professor Ishitid agrees with that.
"We see it so that we need to try it more often, since it is a very unpleasant, inexhaustible desire to do something reasonable," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get rid of constant anxiety and simply get tired.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant overstimulation of the senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
As long as the new law on legalization is to be applied in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team and a student of the public college in the southeastern state of Colorado, was accused of committing a criminal offence, which would soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: retaining a small portion of marijuana and tobacco in which he burned it.
Mr. Orosco said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamare and went by car to cross the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the police discovered in the Marhiwan machine, Mr. Orosko came to the court for the storage of drugs and for the administration of the facilities for the use of drugs - small offences for each of which is considered a fine of $100 - and appointed a date of the trial.
"We are being treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has continued a few weeks after the state of Colorado has voted for the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of minor cases does not depend on the law as much as on the place of consideration.
The charges of small crimes involving marijuana have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken similar action.
Police have already ceased to charge people at 21 years of age and older for the maintenance of small doses, which will be considered legitimate only after a couple of weeks of law has entered into force.
However, in the more conservative areas of Colorado, the prosecutors decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana and have previously been called upon to take responsibility for the use of drugs.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Geneva to the mountains of the West, they voted to prevent the emergence of new registered shipping shops in their premises.
"It all develops so eager that I don't even know what to expect anymore," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the city of Avora in eastern Denmark.
Representatives of the control bodies in Washington state are also very ashamed of their heads.
They should develop rules to define the licensing procedure for the development, processing, distribution and sale of maribouns, and all of this should be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, either good or bad, is in favour of most other states in resolving the use of marijuana, began for medical purposes, and now for pleasure.
"In Colorado a more fragmented market, so they serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council on the regulation of production and production of alcohol in Washington State.
But now that no one can do more, Mr. Smith acknowledges that he is more likely to make any proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have this precedent that we could focus on," he says.
The Law of Washington, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December, and the state will be in a state of uncertainty throughout the year when the public licensing system is not yet in place, and the law of the regime is already under law.
However, there are still minor technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, to find a balance between the State ' s provision of “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade for 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and children's gardens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed maritime trade companies in cities, particularly in Seattle and its capitals,” explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established research group on the Centre for the Law of the Seas.
On 21 November, a police officer from Aurora sent an e-mail message that the city's province would no longer attract 21-year-olds to the responsibility for the small number of mariguanas, and that the police would cease to exclude people from these violations “started at this time”.
The chief of police said that the police would monitor the compliance of the city with the rules governing the activities of seafarers for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug dealers and drug dealers.
The prosecutor of the Wild District in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
Following a vote on the bill, he stated that the province would continue to be responsible for the possession of the Marhiwan, mainly for encouraging its users to attend the course of treatment.
119 persons have been charged with storing two and less unicorns, although many of them have also been charged with other violations.
“The obligation of our institution to pursue acts that are considered criminal at the time of their execution,” Mr. Bak said in his statement.
Even in areas such as the village area of Mesa, where the vote was rejected by the participants on the proposal for the legislization of the Marhihuan.
The Grand Jancson police, the largest city in the area, no longer attract the responsibility of seniors for controlling a small number of drugs.
The District Attorney, Pit Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to file charges on already open cases relating to the storage of marijuana.
"I think that to ensure compliance with the law until it changes - our direct responsibility," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the people of Colorado who participated in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system would not be easy.
In contrast, the reaction of the people in various parts of the state has increased the immeasurably in relation to the local authorities to the experiment with the Marhiwan State.
“There is a cultural barrier to the question of prosecutors in the area,” explains Shawn McCalister, a Danish lawyer who represents the interests of mariners and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws on the Sea.
"They have persecuted people for so long that they can't now calm down because it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first countries in which a small number of marijuana are involved, as well as alcohol, are forced to become an experimental field within the country to check the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legal parties and State officials are planning to expand the territory of legitimate trade, but at the same time they are looking forward to instructions from federal authorities that are still planning to consider sale and development as federal crimes.
The legislators hoped that the Office of Justice would intervene in this matter.
Despite a number of broad resonances of the arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the Federal Government has, in most cases, benefited from the trade of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States.
Agents of the Bureau of Drug Control would hardly break into the house to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they would hardly close their eyes on the regulated authorities of the State of the restaurant of marijuana authorized under the new law, Kevin A. Sabnet, former drug-fighting adviser in Obama ' s administration.
Some cities in Colorado have failed to wait for federal authorities to act.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations approved moratoriums to open new marijuana shops, which could not be opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, had been subject to a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which, of course, would be approved the following week.
"We do not want to be in a position to grant a license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicolesson, a member of the City Council.
Our city has voted against this amendment.
And now we have a conflict between the results of the local vote and what the state has voted for.
There are still too many unknown issues.
Petrolla Whitet: I've survived Oxford because I'm a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views has not begun today.
As much as I remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother were taught in Oxford and described him as the best educational institution in the world, a contemporary anti-Symposium that has two foundations for civilization - free will and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, after studying at the historic college of the University of Oxford College, at the end of the eighth century, I got drunk and excited about what was happening in my first scandal.
My father didn't hold and cry.
Friends were hit by so much.
The Evening Standard reported that I dropped a college because I didn't like my cousins having sex in the next room.
Author E. Norman Wilson said that I was leaving because I had to drink out of a cup of tea.
Actually, it wasn't that fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically injured and scared.
Not because of my rather unusual name or what I've learned in private school.
For one thing, I was suffering for one reason, and in this glorious triumphal procession it seemed to me to be this rivalry and dark fantasy: my father, who is now the late Voodro White, was known as counsellor Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a conservative side.
You're asking why you remember this now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students with a right-wing perspective is subject to the same trauma.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of students in Oxford is so strong that a group of students in the past week needed the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the school club of Corpus Cristi in Cambridge state that they "are often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and stop feeling unwanted" because of their political views.
They would like to introduce a college of additional representatives to the Committee on Equal Rights in order to ensure the freedom of expression of their views.
Their situation has only contributed to the recent BBC 2 documentary film on student policy on the “Friday: Young, smart and right” in which conservatives presented excentrators and non-unazisists.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who is traveling in the Roles-Roise, wearing silver costumes and plus silver scarf.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are “causes of exemption due to higher education fees”.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice-president of the Nottingham Conservatives Association, said in one of the resurrected newspapers that "in the university environment, there is an increase in left-handness.
People who do not even know us before treat us as harsh and without punishment from the parents of the rich."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the historic college of Corpus Cristi College, in which an appeal was made to strengthen protection, called such an atmosphere "unique", and 19-year-old Stefani Cherill, the new president of the Oxford Conservative Association, said that the relationship between the student club and the rights centrers had deteriorated significantly.
"This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was one.
I arrived there in September 1986, a slave and a retired eighteen - year - old girl.
Oxford escaped hatred from the Conservative Party.
A year ago, the university voted in favour of former student Margaret Tetcher, whose initial degree was due to a reduction in budgetary allocations to higher education.
Even Stalinists would be vulnerable to such an atmosphere.
On the first day of the first week of high school, when students met each other and with teachers, I first felt what I had been waiting for.
I didn't know that the teachers not only looked at the fingers on the student-conservative arm but also willingly participated in it.
Political issues, such as harassment, privatization and the Government's refusal to apply sanctions against the Government of the apartheid in the UAR, have resulted in the collapse of extensive forest panels of the auditors' walls.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Whitet," said the teacher, now calm Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me work, I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very jealous man with a face like a cake.
"Techrists don't actually teach French or they just don't understand their brains?" he asked.
Other students were in a hurry.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few basic French lessons at a time free, if you are, of course, not very busy going back to society," Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I sat next to dinner, and then someone grabbed me by my back.
It was James, a student of the second degree in English, who was a member of the Association of Conservatives of the University.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Over everyone who suspects in the sympathy to the conservators will be expelled.
It's not easy for me, but in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll be more complicated.
Most of the first-class conservators are pretending to be lesbians."
Later, in the local pope, I tried hard to hide.
I insisted that not all that Margaret Tetcher says is true.
The speed has failed.
The first professor of philosophy, politics and economics who learned in Estonia said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students supported his words.
I was crushed, ugly.
"How do conservatives deal with sex?" asked one of them.
- They drive each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the end of criminal persecution in the six hundred years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet a single person only under cover of night?
Should I be a lesbian and hide my beliefs?
For three years, I have been plagued with feelings of loneliness, depression, and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the conservators but also for being an adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of its sponsors.
He didn't show up in college.
He preferred it for the provinciality, love and commitment of the Marxist-Determinist to history.
In 1997, he took a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to live in Oxford from a native home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and close friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his school years, there were political views.
"But that's the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- There's no way out there, just not in the city of dirty guns...
Even my Communist friends always say I'm innocent."
His soft eyes were blown away.
"Don't make quick decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you break the university."
I was frustrated by constant visits to London and my emotional protection was weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, did not give up and gave up on his beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when the regular teacher of history called me "a dear people", I decided to do the same.
In the heart of the shame, I admitted that my parents had lost my brain and called them "the old dragons."
The front was short.
The last train in my career in Oxford was sentenced to my father's death.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was closed.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my pursuers left.
When they left, I picked up kemundan and settled on the first trip to London.
I haven't come back yet.
You can call me a joke and a trick.
But in the 1980s, no one should be subjected to such violence and threats in the educational institution.
Even worse, it was Oxford, which not only released forty prime ministers of the Towers, but is still hiding behind the unencumbered reputation of the university, in which they value equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory."
On the exhibition "Valentino: Master of the Shia", which was opened this week in London, ABC met with Nati Abakal, Fion Tissen-Bornemica and other well-known Italian designer customers
Somersett House, former residence of King Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, is worthy of the exhibition on Valentino Gararani.
The designer recognized this at the time of the opening of Valentino: Master of the Shia, a trimfle retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high fashions created by his "home" for the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his inseparable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of a story, the only person in the story -- "Il Sinor" Garawani, but it could not be written without his so-called clients.
Valentino has always felt overwhelmed with sadness and distant peace.
The first hall of the exhibition, opened before 3 March, was filled with personal letters and photographs for the signature of the most famous aristocrats, from Princes Salim Aga-Han to Lord Snoudon, including Mary Chantal, Prince of Greece, and Margaret, Prince of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social support: from a modest port from the city of Voger to northern Italy to the Kumira of the international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong.
"They don't waste their cigarettes on your great cover, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in Aleppo and were good friends.
Valentino is an infamous host and accepts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed visiting his palace in Gstadde," explains ex-wife "Hiney" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauty lovers of the species of Marelle Angelley or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Magya, represented by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria is remembered as a charismatic model.
Once we went to work with him at his home, it was after the fashion show in Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
The style of Valentino was displayed in every detail of his room, in her apartment, in her dining room, in her dining room, in music.
"Each of Valentino's guests had made themselves feel important and loved," recalls the top model, which started with the model in 1995 during the high fashion Sunday in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his scissors are this art production," she concludes.
Parental Counsel
Garawani's life is not a story of wealth but of love with full mutual affection.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's gallery was converted into a six hundred metres-long glaur floor, which suggests changing roles: the visitor is taking the place of models and should defiltate on the floor, the "swifts" of the grass-dressers, who collect the hats from Valentino, such as the payment that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Whitty used in "Nochi" or the coat of shirts and leather that belonged to the emperor of Fara Diba.
In this publication, names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria Foun Tourn and Taxi, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg are highlighted.
Nate Abscal and Modeller, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentine's first love is the first love to forget.
I remember him very well.
It's been walls, rupees, Jilet, and it's from the 1971-1972 summer collection.
"It was a gift he did to me," says Nate Abachel, one of the brain designers.
"I consider him to be the rest of his femininity, his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," added the former Georgian de Feria.
I love the colors that he uses: they have a lot of light and they're "appropriate" to his face.
Ideal ratios.
Princes and legislator of the Patriots of Jovapaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she went to Valentine.
When I was a teenager and living in Italy, I thought I'd have an age and a reason to trust one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that time at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first ticket from Valentino to put it on a holiday in my cousin's lock, Prince Edward de Linn.
It was a nice payout, with a dress-up dress, a dress-up in the box, and a dress-up without a brothel.
"It was a dream that came true," said the widow of Rodrigo, Dr. Arrenberg.
"Walently equivalent to fashion, its passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocratic living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday payments from the model with "maximum caution... because the payment is not just a payment, it's also a collection of memories accompanying it."
King Mode
The large end of the exhibition in Somersett House is a wedding pay for her wedding with Paulus from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the model is called hers) to produce this set of yellow-coloured spindles with a seedling, twelve different rounds and a sleigh in four with a half-metre.
According to journalist Suzi Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the payment is a very high fashion at the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the highest point of the world".
For many years, Valentino has been her best representative.
Cavaler of the Great Cross (the symbol of the highest rank in Italy), Cavaler of the work, Commander of the Order of Arts and Speech, awarded by the Order of the Home Rule, Gararani collected as many honours as any of his clients.
"I have always drawn attention to his silence, his calmness, his exact and inevitable outward appearance," recalled Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, I saw him last month at the Orse Museum.
He's sitting on the table with the Count Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: Kavah-Ijena chess
In four euros, Indonesian sugars risk life and health by weighing 70 kilograms of cheese on the top of the volcano by heavy stones
There are people for whom their work is from, and others work literally.
Among them is Antonio Vijaya, one of 400 chessmen working for the life of the winning series in the Kavah-Iygen volcano located on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sardine gas rising from the depths of the Earth is kept in contact with the air.
Around the huge lakes of lakes, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, is placed in two bubbles, lifts up the roots and carries them up on a narrow stone road.
The height of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, is only 250 metres, but the possible cargoes need more than 40 minutes to take a sharp step, with work to maintain balance and guard the road so as not to fall and fall off the surface.
They know that an unfaithful step can lead to their lives, as happened to a visitor from France who was beaten a few years ago by the Cavah-Igen rock.
Cavah-Ijena's teasers employ 5 euros per kilogram of cheese they get
On top of that, they travel their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were surrounded by circuses, and there are heavy rails, walking three miles [three km] to the peak of the company, which is located at a height of 1,850 metres above.
This is about PT Candy Ngrimbi, a company operating this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, not to say, its employees who pay 662 Indonesian rubies (5 euros) per kilogram of cheese.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euros) of neutrochemical products, since it is distributed in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of ovens, ovens, cosmetics, dynamites and even for the identification of sugar.
"As usual is 70 kilograms of transport, we employ about 46,000 euros (3.8 euros) per walk," explains Anto, who normally performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to earn 138,000 euros (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a mystery to such non-human efforts, it is the second more that he would work in the field.
"The pay is very high on local measures where the coffee collection costs 15,000 euros (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is equal to two million euros (167 euros), " explains the driver who previously worked as a stoneman on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 euros (6.2 euros) a day and the place wasn't so heavy, but Antonio returned with his family to Banjuangi, a city near the volcano, for a great reason that in Indonesia is the same as Sarah: "I married a girl from Bali, where one Indian woman, and brought her to Java to take Islam."
Anto asthma, he's working hard, he's always crying, and he's got his eyes down because of toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Antonio spent three years at risk in Cavah-Ijena, whose cheese had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's stuck with work, he's always crying, and his eyes are down because of toxic gases that give him a volcano.
It's the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I've been working for two more years, because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises more than a welcome English.
This fine, intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, an officer or a port in the hospital, but instead he does the work of the mill.
The part of the rough wooden hygienic with other carriers will rise every day at two o'clock in the night, because the sire will not stop running through the night when its natural yellow color turns deep and glows in the dark.
Scattering the waves, Anto falls into the crater, lighting himself up the path of a small foon attached to his bag, which he bought for his own money.
About 400 passengers wash their bodies with cheese on their shoulders with a woolen skin
Despite the high revenues, the mining company has not been able to manage the profit of the economy and does not provide any equipment to carriers working on its account and with such losses.
In fact, they do not even receive part of the 30,000 Reds (€2.5) collection of photos, which, along with an input ticket of 15,000 Reds (1,2 euros), are taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"This work for the shoe, not for the people," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old Korean carrier who has spent three decades in Cavah-Ijene, since he left college.
He was able to raise up to 110 kilograms, and he was convinced that he would have to work as much as he could, because he needed money for the education of his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Even though the sire is shaking the throat and the eyebrows when the wind suddenly changes and hunts on the surfaces of the clouds that emerge from the volcano, they are so pronounced that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, apparently than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and swelling on the shoulders that have been deformed under heavy roots.
By balancing the corrosion on the back, Uninik can now only weigh 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions produce 15 tons of woolen cheese, which are transported by three trucks to a warehouse in Tamansari, more than 18 kilometres across the coast of the sea.
"I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, a wide open mouth that doesn't touch a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a serial carrier.
Time is running out, but poverty continues from generation to generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: human furniture is being used by Kavah-Igen.
Singapore seeks children to save the economy
Singaporeans charge careers, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot, you're my wife's patriot, I'll fulfill our civil debt, and I'll make life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of soft tapes, but despite this -- or perhaps because of this -- this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local chats like "Let's put a ball in the bag" to smile over the level of birth in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hoped that they would be able to draw attention to this problem in a form of entertainment.
His creative director, Douglas Gamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to fulfill his "national debt".
This is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the main problem in the country.
We are ashamed of the reproducing of such ones in the world, so we felt that this is the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot, for example, to engage in ghosts with pheromones or to organize the evenings of fast knowledge.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but not necessarily worked.
So we wondered why we would not do the most creative thing we could do to solve this problem, that is, to create a rap?
1,2 children
Whoever doesn't understand it so easily, that's the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 per year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, prolongs pregnancy and childbirth leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its leadership and its strong public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
It was the last time it was under 2 which was known as a percentage of the settlement in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office for Couples and Families of the National Government of Population, says that the reason for this "good education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
“This has enabled people to have a wider range of options for life goals and priorities, besides marriage and family development,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contributed to the increase in the number of births and abortions of children, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policies aimed at a sharp increase in immigration in response to the population ' s decline call for reparation among the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that promote easily hidden xenophobic practices with regard to many new immigrants, especially those who critically criticize low-level payment and lack of integration.
The growth of immigration was also considered as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party had failed elections since independence last year.
After the elections, an attempt was made to address the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline of births has a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, health and immigration policies, Singapore's example has also begun to have some unexpected effects.
The Government is making efforts not to build such a small house.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development guide has been used to control the number of small rooms known as the "crowd" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold in 46 square meters.
Nevertheless, there is the view that they can contribute to the low quality of life and lose the incentives of caregivers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, the manager-general of the El Developers housing company, says that their "crowds" are sold much faster than the space samples.
They are more popular in the sense that such rooms are sold for a few days, even a week, faster than room size.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he acknowledged that the new rules provide more clear guidelines for the contractors who had previously been opposed if they wanted to offer too many small rooms in the project.
Too busy
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, following a discussion with Singaporeans working in the financial quarter of the Centre, it appears that they will not have any special effect.
"People are very affected, they live on the road, as well as education, and that's why many people cancel it," said the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man 20 years old.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and prices of housing and education as factors that prevent them from bringing up children.
So, as the Government has not tried to encourage its citizens to have children, in the case of detoxification, the last word remains with Singaporeans.
Private in offline - private in online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a private or "personal life area which has the right to protect from any interference".
What is a person who is under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers posed when discussing situations outside the Internet?
elPeriodico interviewed five children from 10 to 15 years of age, often users of the network.
In four cases they associated a term with "something very mine" in a personal space, and a "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets would not be loaded into the post," said 10-year-old Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of a person on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
At the FB, I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures from the game.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't have shared a photo that wasn't mine or someone who was taking me stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish a wide range of photos of persons who have been charged with crimes or who have written insulting or unkind comments.
Jorge believes that he knows 35 friends he has in the FB and nine of his follovers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
My mother is on the course, she has a password for one of the accounts.
I took Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks - fun, I can talk to other relatives or friends more quickly," he says.
Not thinking, he replied that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't think of anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This youth has open records of Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and has recently acknowledged that 20 people are not aware of his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they are going to give or demand me, I'll just get them out of my accounting record," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy doesn't have an experience that today is known as cybermoving.
One of my well-known friends was in a social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't even know who it was," he concludes.
The victim, José said, didn't remove the record.
"Just included confidentiality."
It then explains the consistency of the steps for the safe recording of the accounting record.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would load pictures of people who are known to be uncomfortable or confusing.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like it or if I wanted it.
"However, I know it's cybermoving," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and specialized education and education, believes that in order to send children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has become a tool to search for information, but the rules of the game have changed through these sites,” she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prenski, professor of pedagogical studies at the University of Jeele and author of the work of the Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, has chosen these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital Aborigines are those who were born in the era of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to learn them while we're still learning," she says.
It explains that this subject is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what they can or can't spread, publish or speak when adults are not enough for it."
"Also, they should be selective, while the most important thing is for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like it if they published a photo of you like what you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign a picture with dinner, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should be online just as they do offline.
She did the same.
“A person is acting with respect, responsibility and other principles outside the Internet, as must be in social networks,” she claims.
Difficulty
Eduardo Guardia, a university teacher, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read the social networks policies carefully.
Understanding each of the paragraphs, they have good grounds for questioning children about the prospect of opening an account online.
"For example, age and what is allowed to spread or publish," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson "not to talk to strangers".
The UNASUR Summit is concluded without the publication of the Lime Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lime Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the mandatory family.
Efe has repeatedly tried to obtain access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President's Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be sent after closure, but then confirmed that it will be published on the Peruvian Government website at a certain time.
On the subject of the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by President Peru, Olianta Umala, during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the Summit was always limited.
During the day, only a video of the Presidential Assembly was transmitted, in the press room, without a "closed meeting and a ban" message.
A small amount of information circulated among the reporters was transmitted to the press-secretaries of some of the UNASUR Governments who attended the meeting but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of the participating presidents, which caused the disappointment of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media, who requested more information.
The administration of President Peru subsequently sent an e-mail to the Media with the "final Declaration" of the Summit, but it was about the Umala statement, not the official document that the summit had completed.
In October, Peru adopted the III Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at the same time, despite the urgent demand for this press, the so-called Lime Declaration, which had previously been declared, was not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had sought to ensure the transmission system for all journalists, but had limited access to information.
The Summit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the judgement of the Hague Court, which regulates the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, met at a regional meeting and ratified that the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in the Hague to hear statements by both parties, in the context of the charges that Lima has made against Santiago.
"We will follow and implement a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently present in this international court," said Umala, along with her Chilean colleague.
“There has been and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals”, he added, and welcomed the desire of the Minor's hands on the flag of those two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia objected to the Divine Covenant this week, according to which it acknowledged the submission of the testimony of the International Court of Justice after the decision on the marine borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The summit was absent from the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Kristin Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011, after his former President Fernando Lugo's imputation, has not attended the meeting.
The Acting President, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate tomorrow and for closing the summit, not later than Wednesday after the Limmian era.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been concluded and that 31 projects had been approved among South American countries, the estimated investment amounting to $17 billion.
Among the agreed agreements, he said that the countries of UNASUR would take “the important steps towards South American citizenship for which we are extending the housing agreement”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in combating civil uncertainty and organised transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, low Internet access in all parts of South America and to address the overall and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not have a trimfactory basis, but should serve to increase our production base and foresee a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to privileged a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the link between South America's areas, particularly in the wood and border zones, together with our countries and create new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in a reading.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru, and that there were limited percentages in his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at greater contact with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-integration to the South American Union”, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have a good relationship with its neighbours, was another topic highlighted at the summit.
In this regard, President Juan Manuel Santos, President of Colombia, said before attending a regional meeting, which he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to conduct negotiations in a dignified form on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice in Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday), maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortegay," Santos said.
“We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact that will require discussions with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we are dealing with this as much civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they will be invited to join the new President of the country, Enrique Pjeja Nito.
The Minister of Defence also met in advance during the 2013 Action Plan, which was aimed at strengthening dialogue and unity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay formed UNASUR, although the last country's participation has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional block.
" South America must learn in Europe about the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the establishment of a common citizenship is the goal of which “South America, in this case, should be taught in Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told Peru's public television that Europeans had “killed each other during World War II” and in other conflicts, “but they are now practically one parent”.
In this context, he protected the draft establishment of South American citizenship, which was approved by the States parties to UNASUR.
"The free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as it is already with members of the Andean community, must be achieved, but still there are reactive sectors that want to bring us back into the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also appeared to be a party to the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with a view to reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read the lessons never take any obligations upon themselves, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"We cannot explain that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum provided by Ecuador's founder, WikiLeaks Julian Assanzu.
Correa believed that he did not regret the decision because he did not give up his principles and respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that in his time “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be issued in a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice for having to come to his territory to investigate the alleged sexual crime, while “only Swedish legislation considers it possible to carry out it through a video conference that might be held by Ecuador's Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of damage to Assanja's physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he got to our embassy, but the messenger told me that he had a small legal problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
Indeed, this is the risk of damage to his physical and mental health due to intrusion in the small area without the possibility of air-conditioning.
"It affects every person's health," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the refugee situation granted to Assanzu from June to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of independence that would enable him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the scourge of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not have negotiations on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, because Assanja, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of processes at various European institutions,” he said.
He said that "if the United Kingdom gives an assurance of integrity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and in other cases, has already done so, asked Mr. Assaja to join Ecuador in London or to ask for Skype, this problem will be eliminated tomorrow.
Korea used the case to prove itself a defender of freedom of print and stressed that it would not tolerate “directness, incompatibility and lies that claim freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom to print are not broken politics, but bad journalists who support food, praise and relief," he said.
In this regard, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, "bankers nor bourgeois-hegemists, are no longer in Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, would "improve the revolution for further development in the right direction".
Korea also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's win in NASA to at least the following elections, arguing that the organization “should be firm and not tolerate opposition and support for shifts under the rule of law” because, in fact, “it has destroyed the legality of Paraguay’s democracy”.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President had decided to "exactly" his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the Hague International Court of Justice, which had been in favour of the Nicaraguan sovereignty.
This decision is not implemented at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to be together.
It is necessary to process their messages to overcome them and move on.
He also hoped for the good conclusion of the dispute on the maritime borders that would lead to the same trial as Peru and Chile, and said that "it was right for Latin America to approach international institutions if two countries were committed to making a decision as difficult as it was."
The opportunity to speak as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for a third term, he indicated that he considered this opportunity “with greater optimism and joy, although it is sometimes hard enough”.
Korea believed that if it missed the elections in February 2013, it would lead to public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in the authorities, but in situations such as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be addressed by the political authorities.
"My political movement thought that I was guaranteeing this possible victory, so I should admit this responsibility," he said.
In case of victory, this would be my last time in office as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Korea also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I was just talking to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he was going to a treatment that had already been planned was routine and that he was expected to leave the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an increase in President Chavez's health," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the seventh summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today - the result of post-diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when it was announced that its AIDS analysis had a positive effect.
"I've been listening to you," he recalls that difficult, despite all that doctor, moment.
The young man stole it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease himself, he wanted to know more about it, and his efforts were justified - he had already observed his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “older” patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he fell in 1994, and has had little opposition.
He lived with the diagnosis of “human immunodeficiency virus” (HIV) for 22 years. At the beginning of the 1990s, it would have been hard to believe that there were options for treatment, too few known about the disease, too much about the disease.
Yes, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to invite him, "because he was late".
In other words, at the time, AIDS was a punishment.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it without damaging the quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement at this time is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment at the same time and the survival of the general population is the same”, said HCG Chief of HIV, Jaime Andrade Vilyanova, pointing out that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Vilyanova, explained that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a prison, but the duration and quality of life depend on the severity of the immune system in patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
In other words, the above implies that one who receives a 25-year-old HIV diagnosis, according to these terms, “sustaining control can live up to 75 years without problems”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life span of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people were killed in Halisco in 2011, and 187 deaths were registered until May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there summers so far?
- I personally feel that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I guess that's what happens in our hospital.
As at least the last 12 years have not been enough for us, the problem is that patients are coming too late because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in later stages of disease.
He said: "Ten out of ten patients are coming when they already have any opportunistic infection; what must be done to increase the impact on overall mortality, so that the diagnosis is carried out at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for mass detection for all those who ask for it."
In its proposal, the experts and officials of the State Council on the Prevention of AIDS in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, the type of Fabrizio, who sought to check in a private laboratory, were motivated only by what his partner did and, despite his youth, he was already at the AIDS stage and even suffered from a cancerous Caposhi, a cancer that was one of the most common disorders.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're dying, and they don't want to know anything.
"When I die at all, I'd better get through three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
Today, his parents only know he's got cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I work hard, I travel, I lead active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I worry about myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILLENIO JALISCO in order to encourage those who are now in the context of the World Day of the Fight against AIDS.
Let them see if there is a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, and if they already have diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person is responsible.
This communication summarizes the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The great gap between health programmes and a simple citizen is the belief of Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who was involved in the problem of HIV.
And that's the biggest prevention.
In the areas of this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, one or two of us have been given one or two times, and now they give us packages per cent, and this is very good, but it is shown that there are those who still have no access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“Why are they for you?” That is a popular question, with contempt and condemnation, by social workers, school consultants, appetizers, and health workers who do not want to hear adolescents, was a propagandist.
I propose to amend this ineffective distribution; to ensure that condoms are not only caught and that hundreds of them are in public toilets in places where young people are often visited.
It's not a promotion of disillusionment.
It is not about the payment of beer and the model, answered Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked if it would be possible to distribute the condoms under his leadership.
"This is not sex, but it is best to make condoms available to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he noted.
Key data in Halisco
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) were recorded.
The State has a 4th place in the national rating for new and comprehensive cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV.
92% of injuries are related to sex, 6% through blood, and 2% to perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who are not aware of it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision annulling the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through the competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes an annual precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has problems with payment capacity.
It appears that procedures to support the survival of companies permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of Poland and the stars, in contrast to international agreements.
In the practical area, the decision of Judge Harlin Hail in the north of Texas on 15 June left vulnerable Mexican companies in front of the possibility of arresting their property on the part of Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the door to the leading producer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the Supreme Court of the United States, resulting in three contradictions.
As an input, while the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Banking Code, the appeal court of the fifth district in New Orleans states that the main proceedings are related to the competitive production in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the abolition of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of transnational property undertakings.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Harmonization of International Trade Law was established as an arbitrator of the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the statement states that without an inter-sessional vote, recognised in the critical scale of the competitive debt production before the parent company of the Vitro branch, there would be no majority required to approve restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are dozens of examples of Agrex and Commercial Mexicans whose inter-sessional debt has been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that the number of branches, or other creditors, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal rejected these data.
On the other hand, it accuses Vitro of a complex situation that has been facing since 2008 with a serious economic crisis that has taken place in the United States.
As soon as Gonzalez Sada's company filed an appeal in the appeal court itself to bring the vote to its appeal, there were five judges, given that only three were voting.
In the event of failure, an application will be submitted for confirmation that will require a review of the trial by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in this case.
In particular, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico as amius curiae (the second court), which described the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, indicating that it was exempt from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely, the rules established for cases of intergovernmental insolvency that guarantee equal rights to officials and creditors.
Two-boats: they're in Vitro and they're in the country.
General balance
In the light of the complaints filed for several months by Mexicana de Aviación, against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrad, who is accused of moussin management, the Association of Airplane pilots has already discovered a bottleneck.
The Authority headed by Carlos Dias Chavez Morino only presented a criminal complaint against the National Banking Commission and valuable books charged with the banning of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney-General of the Republic on the operation carried out by an undertaking to extract from the trust fund F/589 Bank IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be allocated to the purchase of shares of the Professional hotel management company.
As you know, Askarrag Andrad is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Network.
Around Dragon Mart
The group of local and foreign environmentals, scientists, businessmen and members of civil society, gathered at the forum at the Caribbean University, approved a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking about the Giant Sales and Distribution Centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with a living area of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra has been able to unite the Governors of the South-East Zone to counter the monumental forces that have been cut off from the land of protected territories and posed serious threats to the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government ' s refusal to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Corruption, known as an Abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, this case has already occurred in the archives.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate has disqualified itself to consider it as a violation of the freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in a long-term perspective
In an effort to raise long-term debts, without affecting short-term housing, Homex is placing the Burzie Certificate on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identicals, with an offer to pay every 28 days.
Competival appears in the light
The partnership with the trade name Competival, trained by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, has only appeared in the light, will be aimed at the market of software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector Hettin Reyes: "The basketball was my life."
For more than 60 years, he had been involved in this sport and, thanks to it, had traveled throughout the world.
Few in Puerto Rico remember so many basketball stories like Hector Hettin Reyes.
As pre-eminent brain bleeding led him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was loaded into sport for more than 60 years, as a game of small categories, a game of high basketball league, authorized and led by BSN with the Cubans of Bajamona and the president of the Federation of basketball.
"I have played a lot of role in basketball for my life, including several times as I was President BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during his visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bajamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful husband for over 50 years.
"The basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overestimate the claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated pictures and memories gathered for his long journey, testify to this.
Bajamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, it preserves those who remember its way through Kovboov, from the mid-50s to 1982, when it has served as a partner or contract agent for 15 years.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because it was possible to be part of the eight Cuban champions since 1967, as an agent, agent or manager.
It was many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I made a bid with one in 1981, in the year of Jerome Minsi's BSN debate.
Since then, it has continued to be the "Cuco" Ortis, who was the great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was here at the University of Alabama (Birming), said to me, "I have a very strong game for you, growth 6'7."
"Do you want?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best games in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the shooter Raymond Guuss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought Bajmon's champion, Gauss would have helped me win one more.
The Covboov Championship with Gaussian was fun, but I was already away because by 1988, he had become head of the Federation.
By then, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember the first time we won in the United States during the Olympic Qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the 1990 World Championship, at which we received the fourth place, should have been a bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who prevented us from playing the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the 1990 World Championship is the best collection you've ever seen?
She's among the best, as well as what she won at the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that from the Spanish games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke up the United States, which was pretty much like the one that won our bronze at the world champion.
Not only were Minsi, Gaussa, Ramona Rivasa, Fico Lopes and 'Piculina' (Ortisa), but also young (Havier) "Tonito" Colon and James Carter, brother Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario "Kihote" Morales, who could not participate in the 1990s because of the injuries of their knees.
The command, which may not have been the best in the personal composition, but which brought us the gold medal and great joy, was the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tour in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like "Kanito" Newness, Pablo Alice and young Roland Horruitner instead of games temporarily removed from the Panamerican Mar del Plata champion, we won gold in spite of all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortis.
Its indicators on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level the way Piculin did.
And that's no matter what his career is in the different leagues he's playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very difficult question.
We had a very good youth, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young man, I like Leo Ariel's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous period of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s in BSN there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What else have you been doing?
There were things I wanted to achieve, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponse should only play in their own area and only fight against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now children travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At the very least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I'm listening to music, watching music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren, and playing basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the society of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Killer actor Larry Hegman
Larry Hegman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Urte, Texas, became well - known for his main role as John Ross Yuing, more known as J.R., in Dallas, where he charged a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as oil magnetist Jay Ar Yuing in Dallas' television series became a sign of poverty in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday because of the difficulties caused by cancer, according to the family statement provided by The Associated Press to Warner Bros., Dallas's production study.
"Larry came back to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing a character role, which he loved most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him at Dallas on Wednesday, on Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the cycle, was in close contact with Hegman when he died in Dallas' hospital, said her representative, Jeffry Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, happy, lovely and talented, and I'll be very impressed with him.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," confirmed Grey in a statement.
Hemmena was diagnosed with cancer in 1992 and admitted that he had been smoking for many years.
In 1995, he was found guilty of fraud and was transferred to the hospital.
Long before Dallas, Hegmen gained knowledge on television thanks to the role of a regular type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, a channel transpired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played with Captain Tony Nelson, whose life changed when he met an attractive girl who played Barbara Iden and began living with her under one cross.
He was also the chief staff of two comedians who were often in the ephere, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Heer We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movie included roles well-accepted by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But his masterly interpretation of J.R. brought Hygmena to the top of his fame.
The Dramatic Series of the CBS Canal on the Yuings clan and other personnel in its surroundings, from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who shot J.R.?”, designed to create a noise around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's staff are almost not killed, has generated international discussions and millions of dollars that have been at risk in the bookkeeping offices.
This has also helped to attract a serial record audience in that port.
When an answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million TV readers looked at it and converted Dallas into a second of the historical entertainment programme, after the MASH finalization in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (performance of Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. confused her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack her.
Hegman played in Yuinga as a notorious charismatic rapist: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful man who wanted his wife, Sie Ellen (Linda Grey), to be treated.
"I know what to be on the J.R. table," said Hegman in 1988.
It must be said, "The honest citizen J.R. Yuing is here."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, mentioned on Friday Hygmena as someone "both gross and off-screen."
He does not forget, and he does not change, for millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown several months ago with greater success on the TNT channel.
The fifth episode of the second season was completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not made a statement about what will happen with the series after Hegemen's departure.
Fort-Uerta, Texas, was a son of actresses and poet Mary Martin, who stared in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 at the time of his marriage to a lawyer named Ben Hegman.
He was lucky at the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s and then served in the UK from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist named Michael Axelson and married him.
There were two children, Preston and Haydi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu, where there were many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolute Truth) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything that would have been possible to cause or affect anyone in any way," he said.
After the transfer of profits, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who experienced fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they come to the operation, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, such as, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a while, but you'll be fine."
He also spoke actively against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course to study the end of the world
Every week, students study apocalyptic events such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
On this Wednesday, when professor of religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an inexhaustible premeditation: the end of the "long-record" calendar of May 21, which was held by many people as proof that the end of the world would end.
But Sharme had no idea what he was expecting in the next couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the “long-term Armageddon”, and the growing conflict in which Israel will enter, a place where Christian theories of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharme said this week to the students of Rutgers-Kamden University (New Jersey).
If we were to analyze what is happening in the world today, as if we had all 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, it's good for those who have apocalyptic image of mind.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the Templas University of Appointed Professor Barry Wacker reads the course "The Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are analyzing why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the ways in which hypothetical scenarios call for certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
In this month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students what might be likely, probably, and impossible," Wacker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solar, an associate professor of history of art and anthropology, joined to read a course called the World Council.
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, in case the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the “unlessed destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and conduct results-based examinations.
In Penn State the final exam will be held in the Canon of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice except to work "to the same night that the end of the world is likely to come," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The city ended in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high average ball, which was recorded by 35 students.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
The students, in turn, believe that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of the religious and sociology department of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Kamden.
And the apocalyptic image was thought, worldly or religious, just a matter of satisfaction or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychologist and nursery student, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach this," he noted.
I like him.
But none of the students asked - no longer talking about the professor - said that he believed in the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project affected the prophecy of May, and in some ways we deduced it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there was a apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which took place for several centuries, where people responded to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has raised these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerti, professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches the courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew any course about "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the order of the above-mentioned body.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
The restall noted that for a long time there was much talk about the last days of the court, and he said that if nothing would happen on 21 December, "the people would immediately begin to think about the next day" or to imagine that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period during which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe from this date.
Some said they're going to go to "the end of the world" party.
"Maybe I call a friend to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old college student.
