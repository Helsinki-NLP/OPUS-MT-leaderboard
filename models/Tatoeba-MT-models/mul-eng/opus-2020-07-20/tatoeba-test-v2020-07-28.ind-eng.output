You've been thinking about this since morning.
That's the fruit.
I'm tired of heavy flu.
These things have been released.

Hello, how are you?
What you need to do is sign your name here.
He hates the party.
There's something I want to tell you.
"Did you ever see Tom carry a handbag?" "Tom? No, never."
I did it every Sunday morning.
I really like it.

Tom wants a 'sport' car and he's not interested in a family car at all.
It's amazing!
It's good.

Lamps are used to adjust the lens.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room has a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't blow that red light.
Bring me a glass of water.

Thank you very much.
Yes!
My father loved music.
It's very easy to date Tom.
Go home?
No one cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this morning.

Tom's one of my friends.
Tom sent me three more messages yesterday.
I'm just telling Tom what Mary told me.

That may have influenced their decision.
The rain lasts all night.
Tom's got a fever.
Let me send you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
That's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
It's our responsibility to help.

I'm not ready yet.
Mary refused to go to the concert.
When are you going home?
She's sitting around her grandpas.
The boy sometimes sleeps on his shoulder.
Jim's still not used to walking on the left side of the road.

I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?

He must have succeeded.
I like cats.
It's finished at nine o'clock.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Maybe I'm crazy?
We were facing a difficult winter period.
I have to ask, right?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made mistakes.
You better tell Tom not to do it.

Tom was so excited about the noise that no one could hear him.
Did you see anything?
What are you looking at?
Did he take long?
He picked it up every morning, when he went to school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very expensive, better than the left.
We didn't really see that crash.
His mother was worried about his son.
What opera is being shown at the Lincoln Center right now?

We invited that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom ordered Mary to follow him.
It's late.
I'm smarter than them.

It's just gone.
They're crazy!
