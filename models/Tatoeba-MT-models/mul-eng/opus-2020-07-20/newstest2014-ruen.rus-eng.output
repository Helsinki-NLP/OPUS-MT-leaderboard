Two men were killed in Kineshme and the area
Previously, one of the seniors had already tried suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, a man was born in Lugowo, a village in the village of Lugowo, where he was born in 1947, and he was killed by an increase.
Of course, he had already taken suicide attempts.
What caused a man to take such an unwise step.
On 31 October, from 11 to 50, the inhabitants of Kineshma were killed by a 41-year-old man.
The signs of violent death have not been detected, and the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
You got a black box in your car?
As long as American road designers are trying to find money to repair the dispersing road system, many begin to see a solution in a small black box, which is right on your car's pick-up panel.
These devices, which follow every traffic-trafficking car driver and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of the dispute of the modernization of the American old system of financing by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
Typically, intense debates and color alliances have resulted in intense planning of automobiles.
The Liberians joined the environmental groups in lobbying the Government ' s right to use small parcels to track the number of miles you have spent and perhaps even where you are going, and then to use this information in tax accounts.
Chepet movement in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
And although the convention is not yet possible, whether it continues or not, a number of States do not expect to be gathered.
They think of how it is possible to move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the test of these black holes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the issue on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Association of the Governments of South California, who is preparing plans to start monitoring by the authorities of the country of the mile of each California car by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for this.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds in the Government's Road Construction Fund financed from taxes paid by the Americans on car repairs.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars spend more than a mile on one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise taxes even to one cent at high gas prices.
“Benzine aid is simply impossible to maintain,” said Li Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in a long-term perspective,” he said.
The employees call this a misappropriation fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce the load and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example.
The planners in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to achieve the target indicators set by the ambitious laws of the state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Bill Shoster (Republic, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also considered this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Free Market Commitments in the Reason Fund are also on the verge of allowing leaders to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go black," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former United States transportation ministers who in 2011 called for the Congress to move towards a false charge.
The United States Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million last year, which would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the Houses of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing electors who often have to spend a lot of vacations in their daily lives to get to work or in the city.
A few states and cities, however, are on their own.
The largest enthusiasm is expressed in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 leaders are involved in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile of escape instead of a gas bill.
The pilot project in Nevada is already over.
He's in New York.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with the participation of freight cars.
The I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 Eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow their steps.
“The concern about the “big brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alauddin Han, who was responsible for the strategy and management of efficiency in the Department of Transport in Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were complete, the United States Office of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be very difficult to convert these devices into a full-scale sequence.”
There is no need to create a large, large-scale technological infrastructure, which will certainly be expanded to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where the difficult search for low-tech technology is carried out, which would allow state authorities to take account of the traffic of the mile but without information on the location and time.
If you can do this, Han said, society will feel more comfortable.
The demand for this technology has led some state agencies to a small youth company in California called True Mileage.
The company did not contribute to the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market for the type of car insurance that drivers pay on the basis of the distance.
But the devices it testing attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with the modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t track their speed and do not track their positions,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director, True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are much less expensive and less binding ways to do this.
In Oregon, projectors experimented with the provision of different options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may simply give up the device by deciding to pay a fixed amount based on the average number of miles that all citizens of the state are traveling.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea of warning the public, preventing the devices from doing more, not less.
In New York, transport agents are trying to develop a taxable device that will also take payment on parking bills, to provide “payments like driving” insurance and to collect data loss in real-time mode from other drivers who could be used by car drivers to avoid fraud.
“ Automobiles will be drawn into the benefits they are offering them,” says the map of urban design.
Some transport designers, however, wonder whether all exchanges of payments are simply a huge drawback.
In the City Transport Commission on the San Francisco River, officials say that the Congress could simply exceed the bank rate of the Trust Road Construction Fund by imposing fines on gasoline.
An additional single-time or annual tax could be taken with the drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when everything you need to do is accept aspirin,” said Randy Rentsler, director of the Commission on Law and Public Relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their own private life and many other things.
EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of the economic pressure of Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan for the gas supply of Ukraine and for the achievement of an agreement with the IMF on external credit if Russia will take any measures in response to the possible signing of an EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating standby loans, and another EU official who is directly involved in the negotiations has added that their purpose is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
The analyses interviewed by Reuters are doubtful that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-term differences in funding conditions.
It does not believe that the reforms needed to obtain assistance are possible and that the international rating agency S&P, which was lower than the UK's sovereign rating on Friday, is one step up to "W-" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF may show flexibility in credit terms taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to ensure Ukraine's gas supply, which is now part of its supply from Russia.
Maybe it's going to be gas from the North River or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to the officials, is the most possible and acceptable way to do so if Russia "isolizes" Ukraine.
Analyticals believe that such a reverse supply can only be used in Ukraine within a few weeks, and it is likely to lead to a reduction in supply in other regions.
"The negotiations between EU and Ukrainian countries are being held on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but on other routes," added Reuters.
Russia’s External Combating Urban Pollution
Efforts to address transport problems in major cities have been observed in most of the world's megapolis since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it has been either about their refurbishment and expansion or about attempts to reduce demand for car trips, the number of cars and their time of use.
The example of Singapore is well - known, where there is a strict quota of growth in the number of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
His price can be twice the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have paid for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, there are so-called green areas where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to access high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electro-fuels).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a five-year clean air plan for 2012 at a total cost of about 250 billion June (about $40 billion).
As stated by the Director of the Department of Transport Control of the Environmental Protection of Beijing Li Kunseng, the main objective of five years is to reduce air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase by not more than 5 per cent of the fuel consumption in one vehicle.
According to the agency, car transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include restrictions on the use of car transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
In addition, urban measures "green five-years" include a rapid transition from the rest of the country to the European fuel standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and labelling of cars and fuel, restrictions on access to cars in the central part of the city, bans on the use of older vehicles (in addition, the creation of encouraging financial programmes for older cars on hybrids or electromobiles), the development of electricity transport (including public and official), public transport development (including high-speed).
Beijing's car innovations also included a ban on all private vehicles moving within the fifth wheel (all six of the KNP headquarters) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle number) and the issue of registration marks for vehicles on the basis of the lottery (e.g. in 2011, for the first year of the lottery, the total number of registration permits for private cars in Beijing was only 3 out of the number of 2010.
According to the current "Environment of the Environment for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution needs to be reduced to 128 (in 2012 they were 138).
According to Minprerod, 41 per cent of the emissions of pollutants in the urban atmosphere were “transportable sources” in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are more than ten times more industrial and in St. Petersburg than nine times.
In the RFF, there is only one way to think about the possibility of limiting car regulation in urban streets.
The Director of the U.S. Institute of Transport and Transport Policy, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at demand for motor vehicles - if not popular - can be taken by society only under their full university.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its car park, where there are two low-sensitivity classrooms, both functional and personal cars, and the "delegated" users ' cars, totaling at least 200 thousand (about 5 per cent of the total number of cars in Moscow).
In the days of the urbanists from the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyse the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and road transport.
The main findings of researchers: the city centre is twice as low as required, and most car drivers living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking lots or just in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parks, but to maintain cars, not to extend, but to reduce the passage (in order to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians), and to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the border areas of the historical centre area (a total area of about 3212 C.E., covering a number of central areas of the city).
Taxation for unauthorized street trade in Vlogde will increase in time
According to the city authorities, the increase in taxes would help to establish order in Vlogda and free the streets of natural palaces and boats.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the production they carry out is often not under adequate health control.
And that means that you're in danger of being in good health.
Yes, the lower fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November to November is six times as high as 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, reports the Vlogde Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver of poor economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer credit and the mass reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of this growth.
It has recently been completely driven by consumption that is almost non-relieving," said the chief economist Goldman Sachs on Russia, Clemens Graphe, introducing a quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.
The nominal increase in wages in Russia is about 10 per cent.
In the case of inflation at 6 per cent, it will be able to provide a future consumer demand at the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
However, the profitability of Russian companies falls, so they are most likely to be optimised by staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in GDP wages: if payments increase by 10 per cent, GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Graphe explained.
The companies were faced with a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot pay, comments the principal economist Barclays Capital for Russia and SNG Vladimir Pantnusin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, high wage competition for workers.
In order to transfer or retain existing staff, employers have to pay.
The demand for support in Russia is growing rapidly.
In his view, Mr. Graphe did not provide this type of credit because of the extremely high rates of consumer loans for the multiplicity effect on the economy of the country.
"We have never seen any benefits for the growing consumer credit economy, money does not spend on the economy, but return to the same banks as interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is, in Goldman Sachs, waiting for an increase in unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
The percentage of such loans is high.
As a result, they are no longer returning," said Mr. Graphe.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is the possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of WHO Vasili Solodkov is now seeing signs of an emerging bank crisis.
Small credit organizations, with no access to scarce resources, as host banks have, have been forced to attract the population by a high percentage.
In response, the House went into the midst of the war and reduced the credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot pay the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest rate.
If they do not give up, Russia is threatening the full banking crisis, it trusts Vasili Solodkov.
The loss of several banks' licences in the past week is considered by the economist to be the cause of mass destruction.
"The same situation has not been met by the honourable Member: the investment insurance system has not significantly been calculated in the system crisis," the head of the institution warned.
However, the growth of consumption is slow and without the crisis of non-payment, which is based on the decline in the indexation of wages for the staff and the military in the current version of the draft budget.
A partial impact on consumption will be reduced by freezing of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by reducing inflation).
But only partly: if investments do not grow (and prefer to do so before - see the report), the growth of consumption will all be slowed down, as believed in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantnusin of the Barclays Capital has not yet seen a preview for the implementation of the pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling prices on oil," he says.
According to its assessment, the economy of Russia will start to decline at oil prices below $90/bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to reduce the percentage rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is seen: inflation has decreased, and banks have risen rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced a shift into inflation," said Clemens Graphe.
The central bank's interest rate policy does not affect market rates, but only on interbank credit rates.
"It's the end of all hopes for the CB," Clemens Graphe assessed.
Banks are used, not to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As the rate decreases, the currency rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the rubles.
"In the morning or later, the CB will understand that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graphe, and recalled that the State plans to release the ruble into "free shipping" by the end of 2015.
However, it considers that this should be done sooner or later or raise the key rate of CB (5.5 per cent).
According to his assessment, the rubella course is now artificially up to 10%.
I'm just going to break down one road, and an expert concludes.
But if the CB is in the hands of the financiers, even the darkest doubt is that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, it can seriously affect the ruble.
In Chelabinsk, the people of the South Ural II attended.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national-cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive bodies were involved in the gathering, in total, about 350 persons.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening international consensus.
Here we can show examples not only in other regions but also in other countries.
We don't have any differences and differences.
We live in full understanding of each other," says Feofan, Mitropolit of Chelebian and Goldstone.
A number of issues were discussed during the meeting, including patriotism education, cultural cooperation.
The resolution was adopted after the meeting.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
Here the exhibition of the national cultural associations of the Chelabin area was opened.
Ready to “co-operation” with Germany on United States intelligence
Edward Snouden, United States intelligence publisher, said he was willing to go to Berlin to show the German parliament if the National Security Agency and its director, Kit Alexander, were unable to answer questions about his activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr. Snoudene in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to Mr. Snoudena, who was introduced by the MEDI in Berlin on Friday, he said: “As a result of my efforts, my Government continues to deal with the inconsistencies as a change and seeks to criminalize political statements of criminal charges without any protection”.
Speaking the truth, however, is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snouden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to give up criminal charges against him.
The accusations made by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include spying and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snouden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to do so."
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the ABB had listened to Angel Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a member of the parliamentary group governing the intelligence service, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snouden as a witness, “without endangering his or her relationship with the United States,” she should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, Parliamentary member of the Green Party of Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snoudden on his Twitter.
During the visit to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr. Ströbele said that Mr. Snouden would not have returned to Russia if he had gone.
If Mr. Snouden had indicated in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “safely”, said the MP.
Mr. Snouden said in his letter that he had met with a “earnest and constant” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was inspired by a global response to his “political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including in the United States, considered the disbursement of the uncontrollable system of universal consequences to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities, “when the humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will take a hand-held payment
Frontier Airlines plans to take passengers up to $100 because they carry a handbag on their train.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 per hand and $2 per coffee or gas, although their announcement in the middle said passengers could leave the whole bank.
The new hand-held fee is distributed to bags in upper bags, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would take $25 if the collection was paid earlier, and $100 if the passengers were to pay only when they went to the landing.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Melli said that the payment of $100 should stop passengers from getting paid earlier.
"We don't want to get paid for it," she said.
The airlines began to charge for the first and second bags of cash in 2008.
Travellers trying to avoid these collections are stealing as much as they can in a handbag that is placed at the top of the baggage compartments, which is why there is often no room in these sections.
Congregations are one way to allow passengers to carry less on board.
O'Melli said this new collection wasn't actually about making money.
The fact that the most loyal customers in Frontier claim that finding a place in the top baggage is becoming increasingly difficult.
Travellers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger on the way out of Frontier can get free of charge, while the next passenger on the route can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Melli said that the change in procedures on the website and the frontier register was called to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they arrived at the landing.
The new Frontier manual collection will not start until flight, even though the date has not been set yet.
Travelers often complain about money and other collections, but airlines love them.
They claim that the baggage treatment is money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many at Wall Street believe that the addition of baggage is a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to cover aviation costs after a few years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not care about congregation meetings.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection of manuals three years ago, and another Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Air Company Consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional meetings.
According to his assessment in the December 2011 report, the cash collection will provide Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, former Field Manager Midwest Airlines, recently flew by Spirit train, and it was interesting to him that he would find out when passengers meet with the unusual Spirit collection on the ground.
“The landing process was the most smooth of what I saw for my career in the airlines,” he said.
I've been waiting to see the toothpaste and the drying up on the floor.
Samuel was a pool, he said, "and the flood was over."
Frontier is also supposed to be Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice could leave their entire bank and that coffee would be provided free of charge.
She'll still be free to water.
US Airways had recently tried to pay for drinking in 2008, but refused to do so in seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airlines followed her example.
Frontier's initiative to charge cash when passengers don't buy tickets directly to the airline is her last step towards attracting customers to their website.
The airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly to them instead of turning to a tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began to give twice less bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through the online travel agency.
In the middle, it cuts the minimum number of miles up to 25 per cent from miles of travel.
Yes, a 1000-mile trip from Frontier, acquired by an online tourist agency, would allow 250-mile travel.
In addition, passengers can choose a location earlier only if they buy tickets directly on Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal client base in his hometown of Dave, but her business is falling and losing.
The allocation was reduced by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial result published in the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to improve Frontier's finances in the context of the airline's sale.
ABB wins "inland error" rather than hackers at the end of the site
The Secret National Security Agency stated on Friday evening that the closure of their site for several hours caused technical damage, not hackers, as the network had claimed.
“NSA.gov has not been available for several hours today because of an internal error that occurred during the planning update”, the intelligence agency reported in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that the break in work has been caused by a split-off attack of the type [DDoS] type of service.
Earlier today, online server monitoring systems have recorded that the ABB site has not been working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
The former representative of ABB reported that ABC News had been damaged by the internal secret network of the agency ' s "no" agency.
No classified information is at risk, the representative reported.
At least one online hacker group stated that it was responsible for the conclusion of an ABB site with the help of DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to penetrate the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is not out of the building.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal target system.
Previously, when ABB received the name “Net of the Agency” in the last few months, public attention and critical criticism after the opening of its wide-ranging programmes abroad and within the country were all of this response to ABB's secret files stolen from the agency and published by former ABB Officer Edward Snoudden.
The increasing police force around the agency has only led to the fact that today's incident has been the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's income is reduced by the delivery and number of orders on the aircraft
Bombardier, Canadian aircraft manufacturer and travel company, reported on a 15 per cent reduction in net income by reducing the number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
Bombardier, located in Montreal, also did not publish any data on its new CSeries aircraft's annual tests and did not provide any further information on whether ambitious aircraft deployment plans would be implemented until September.
After the first flight of an experienced pilot of the aircraft, which took place about half a month ago, he only flew three more times, which raised questions about whether the time of the test was running.
The results did not justify the projections and led to a reduction of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Fund.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, dropped his evaluation on Thursday from “high-end” to “medium” because of the belief that the increase of shares is limited to the nearest quarter or two.
“Although the decrease in air cargo supplies was generally expected, we are certainly disappointed by the arrival of the transport department,” Doerksen said in a fund market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as soon as the summer test programme continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will be more sensitive to the programme.
Bombardier Company hopes that the CSeries will allow it to take place in the lower market price segment, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first example of the aircraft was presented in March and the first flight occurred in September after a few months of delay.
However, strong orders on CSeries are still not too much, 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of summer tests to check the company's approval of the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are still 403 orders and agreements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Director, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombardier would achieve its goal of 300 strong orders until the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
The fourth leaders also assured the analysts and the media that the programme is moving forward.
“The pilot model of the aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected”, Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that on-the-fly ground tests and software updates were planned.
All manufacturers are planning different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and stop the upgrade, and so did we.
This will take place during the entire summer trial programme.
The second of the five test samples should be carried out in the next week and all the others will follow it soon, as reported by the company.
However, the analysis is a sceptical statement that the first client could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the date of entry into operation and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow pace of summer trials – although, of course, and according to Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Dorkssen said.
In the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share last year.
The adjusted share income remained at 9 cents earlier.
The gross income dropped slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents for the share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In the fourth world, the aircraft manufacturer reported that he had placed 45 aircraft for the quarter, less than 57 years ago.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of the Aviation Division's orders amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“The results in the aviation area have been consistent with our objectives, but a small number of orders and common market conditions have become an unacceptable factor,” Boduan said.
Aerospace income fell by 13 per cent — up to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest travel producer, reported that gross income in this sector would rise by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, a slightly higher figure than 31 December.
The revenues of the transport unit had been adversely affected by a number of major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced that the chief financial director of the Google Patrick Piquet Corporation, would come to the Board of Directors at 8.5 per cent, up to US$4.83 in the middle of the quarter.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third largest commercial airliner and the closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony calculates a lower annual income
The Japanese electronic manufacturer, Sony, completed the previous quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reducing the forecast of income for the current financial year.
Sony's results over the period from July to September 2013 were more impressive than it was expected to be related to the demand for television, video cameras and computer production of the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, in the second quarter of the company's first three-year operating profit of 5.2 billion yen, was reimbursed to 9.3 billion yen's loss during the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronic market is experiencing a difficult time, especially due to a reduction in demand on television.
While competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main opponents, Panasonic Corporation, has recently focused on industrial complexes: the sales of companies are growing at high rates, especially through car systems and clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year ending in March 2014, Sony is expected to receive 179 billion yen operating income against expected previous 230 billion yen.
In addition, according to the Thomson Reuters agency, the analysis suggested that this figure would be significantly higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
As Sony's trying to get out of the crisis, he's expanding the product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of the sale of “study” hours from a Japanese corporation dedicated to a number of fashion functions that will allow you to get rid of the need for 100 times a day to deliver from the smartphone.
After Sony reduced the annual revenue and revenue forecast, the company's shares in Tokyo's market opening dropped by more than 11 per cent in the morning, reducing to 1668 yen by one share.
Gen said he was a synapses educator.
Students from the University of John Hopkins and Mount Sinai Medical School discovered whites, which stimulates the formation of new connections between neurons by the Foxp2 gene.
A study published in Science can be found on the magazine's website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene that is directly related to the word.
His role was to be established in 2001 through the discovery of a few people who could not properly express themselves and sometimes even understand each other.
Scientists have found that the work of the Foxp2 gene has been destroyed by family members, but the way it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists indicated that at least part of their Foxp2 functions are performed as a booster for the education of new brain synapses related to word formation.
He does this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter has been identified as a result of the search for factors that stimulate synapses education.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and only on its activity is Foxp2.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects the causalization that scientists have confirmed in the muscle experiment.
When the animal activity of the gene was artificially reduced, they cried less when separated from the mother.
If the activity of the gene has been restored, the frequency of sound released has also been restored.
Previously on the mouse, links had also been shown to the caricalicization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that introduced a human gene ate more active and less frequent than normal mice.
At the same time, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2's work is related to the work of SRPX2 and, respectively, their SRPX2 management with the clear "mechanical" properties of sound education or more subtle processes.
Lawyer with cocaine addiction, who warned the head of the criminal group of police investigation, in prison
42-year-old Bararate Child transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of selling his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basarat Kitta transmitted to the criminal authority Nile Scarboro secret information on his investigations into illicit drug trafficking after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who received the name Bas and who was known as a “hard lawyer” criminal was arrested at home in 2011 after a police investigation in Scarboro, which he had previously presented to a drug-related court.
Officials noted how 32-year-old Scarboro left three packs of cocaine at the lawyer's home in the town of Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was in the company of lawyers with colleagues.
As a result, it was found that the child “regularly used ” class A drugs after tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to get information on two arrests on the orders of Skarboro as well as one of his agents.
All four suspects were currently under police surveillance under the extensive investigation of the criminal organization for heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambridge, Merciside, Berkshir and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later locked in prison after the police took over the heroin and cocaine series and over £1.5 million and over £200,000.
The 42-year-old Child has provided information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction will be revealed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court, Dieta, who works in Forbes Solicitors, a legal company in Blackburn, was covered by an exhibition following the recognition of his guilt in two cases of intent to impede the exercise of justice by the three-week court of the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He acknowledged the storage of cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The lawyer's statement was made after the police investigating the activities of Scarboro found that he had regularly talked to the Child on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and discovered how he came to the house of the Child in Blackburn and placed 60 per cent of the drugs in a black box for golf under the law firm.
Shortly after Skarboro's transfer, he had several calls from Dita, who was at the football stadium of Ivod Park, the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine talks were held between them.
The court was aware that the child had “regularly used” cocaine, after tests found that Class A drugs were found in his hair, bone and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine, said that he spoke to the suspect dealer, as he was his client, and insisted that their community was “a lawyer’s secret”.
During her detention, the child took his wallet and tried to obtain several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had hair samples taken.
On a police inquiry, he said that he had a home office, along with his work place, and his clients came to him in legal cases.
However, the court was aware that after major arrests, he called for the largest involved in illicit drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them that they were known by the detectives.
Ann White said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta was accused of abusing his position by a criminal lawyer because he had been too close to certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who provides his own lawyer.
Some of his talks will certainly be legal because he was their lawyer.
However, this has exceeded the limits of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He has prevented the police investigation as strongly as possible in order to enable those persons to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Dieta didn't read his profession, but he did.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarboro, and had doubts about his interest.
The child did not admit his guilt and said: “If I had been a corrupt lawyer who was not my own, and I would like to give information to Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn’t have stayed 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
However, after the meeting of senior officer Lee Holsted of the Lanquira police, he said: “Mr. Dieta has become a criminal lawyer in criminal cases, as soon as he has begun to obtain drugs in the representatives of organized crime”.
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main perpetrators of criminal groups who had commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and promote confidence and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to close his profession.
The investigation in the case of Mr. Ditta, said that the Lanquira unit had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage and that it was still continuing to stop the administration of justice, demonstrating our desire to receive fair punishment for criminals.
Let the case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the scope of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Skarboro himself was convicted for 14 years after recognizing his guilt in a speech for the purpose of delivering heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
35 other persons involved in the machine were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Dieta organized a discussion in the form of questions and answers that he says his dream work is a lawyer representing clients with death sentences in America, an ideal company for him for his wife, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work is inequality.
The stadiums in Yaroslavla were not ready to host 22,000 observers, and police officers who were present at the CDC RFS meeting today.
The ticket programme, they believe, has been expanded about twice.
At the time of match 1/16, Cuba's Russian terminal with Spartacus was operated by only a thousand stairwells under the regulatory rule of nine thousand.
Spartakov patients were placed in 2200 places, which is 10 per cent of the combined stadium, but they were sold 5,000 tickets according to the Moscow Club.
This data was made known by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigoryanz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the American Special Service, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the States had heard the telephone talks of senior Japanese officials.
The person confirmed that there were several points to be heard in the country of origin.
He noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in intelligence against each other.
According to him, this was the case during the Second World War when these countries were allies.
In Japan, as in Germany, despite relations with the United States in the post-Section period, the NHK telecommunications network reported.
Officially, none of the parties have commented on this information until it has been made available.
Remember, news of the United States Special Service's follow-up to the FRG Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the ABB could have listened to Merkel’s phone for the last ten years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some data, realized that his hearing was very painful.
She stated that associations who, in her view, had been FRG and the United States for decades had not been able to accept such observation by the head of the Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snouden stated that he was prepared to give details of the hearing of the telephone conversations of Angel Merkel with the German prosecutors.
Germany was a special agent in Moscow to meet with the former CR staff.
Austria can show grain on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014
In the course of public procurement interventions, a grain may be placed on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014, the Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Nicosia Kovalenko is of the view.
Today, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales in the Intervention Fund.
Until the price on the market is higher, and there's a question.
"Maybe grain will be presented on the market after the New Year," he said at the press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, agricultural crops were estimated at 3.1 million tonnes, including cereals - 1.7 million tonnes, more than 3.3 per cent more than in the past year.
By January 2014, there were 550,000 (105,000 more than in 2012).
Large areas under a special bed and a tricycle, the seed remained on the previous level.
There are no "Brade Circle" groups in the MDGs, which are listed in the United States of America.
The Russian forces' database of the "Brade Circle" group, which Washington listed the song of Gregory Leps, does not matter.
As reported by the Interfax in the law enforcement authorities of the RFI, after reports of the Ministry of Finance of the United States of America were received by Gregory Lepsa in the control lists of suspects belonging to the European Criminal Syndicate of the Brethren, all databases were checked, but no such groups were found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the support of the Mipha of the so-called "Russian Mafia", which is widely regarded as a foreign force.
"Yes, in the very name 'Breath Circle', there's a part of the mystery, there's a clue to a secret lie.
"It's all very similar to peer action," said the agency's associate.
On 31 October, the US Ministry of Finance announced that it had entered into its suspect control lists as part of the Euro-Mediterranean Criminal Syndicate, Artora Badalian, Grigoria Lepsveride, Vadima Lellina, Sergey Moscalenko, Jacob Ribal and Igorya Shikivov.
The individuals involved in this list are suspected of having relations with some of the rulings of Leonte and Gafur Rahim, who are considered to be members of the criminal groups and are included in the United States Sanctions Lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "is a provider for money delivery on behalf of Vladislava Leonteeva".
At the Conservative Centre, Gregory Lepsa refused to comment on the United States accusations to the singer, calling them "the flag."
In 2011, U.S. President Barak Obama referred to the "British Round" as a "prominent transnational organized criminal group" and ordered the minifin to "press and stop their global criminal operations".
The arrest of a person on the black list of the American minifin would lead to the blockage of his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with those living in the United States.

Turkey's Politicians declared hunger against Syria's border walls
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separate wall in the city of Nussabin in the south-east of Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD party have spoken severely against the construction.
The mayor, who was at the Syrian border with the Turkish city of Nussabin Aishe Geekhan, announced a hunger strike, protesting the construction of a apartheid wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported the RIA News in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
The police repeatedly protested protests.
The head of Muammer Guller, Turkey, began to investigate the construction fact and then said that the wall was working to secure the border security.
"Mr. Nussaibina Aishe Geekhan, a member of the PMD, declared the famine and thus turned his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly battle," the party's press office said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, who have crossed the border freely during the half-year period.
"It's an inhuman situation with which lies never agree," the party's representatives quoted Aisha Geekhan as saying.
According to the press service, on 7 November there was a planning to launch a move against the construction of a separate wall.
Venezuela will set a price rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange course for its national currency, the disease, with respect to the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, the Bloomberg agency was informed of this reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange annual amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of US dollars.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the disease acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific course of the disease in respect of the dollar will be established later.
In February, Caracas was forced to dispose of the local currency up to 6.3 dollars.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57.
Since the beginning of the year, the disease has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, the inflation rate in Venezuela was nearly 50 per cent.
On 18 October, the Minister for Oil Industry and Vice-President Raphael Ramirez said that Venezuela had no plans to exploit the patient.
According to informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of limiting prices for products and products in general consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
Last year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet books in Venezuela.
Director of "Yugrey" Andrey Belmach noted that it would be difficult to say how long it would take to find a new master.
This post became vacant after Sergei Shepheleva was released.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how long it would take to find a new trainer, I'm not ready - it's the ITARD-TASS word Belmacha.
Maybe, day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
It is not just a matter of finding a coach, but a person who works in our club for several years and gets certain results.
Chinese press is prohibited by the law of provocation on media
“This is a terrible place, and there is a reason for the question: what can Parliament not allow to destroy the independence of the judicial system in the future?” said the newspaper, calling the law non-institutional.
“This law is very serious and cruel, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Camau, director of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected radio stations in Kenya and a news site.
He said that the new judicial authority on mass media “will always be strict as it is the continuation of the Government”, and the restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya ' s global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to his Members,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, a new law would actually allow the Government to “take the media out of the dead”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been severely affected” and described the bill as “dragonous”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack of Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Chinese media provoked the anger of the authorities by transmitting surveillance cameras where troops sent to the scene of the attack were supposed to seize the expensive trading centre.
The response of the chief of police, David Kimyio, was the challenge of two journalists and a media officer to investigate, although the challenges were rejected after mass media protests.
According to the new law, the issue could be spent on up to 20 million Chinese shillings, and individual journalists, up to one million with an additional risk of being “out of the list”, would be prohibited from obtaining official journalists accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one stroke is sufficient to parallel the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called “living blogosphere”.
Politicians understand that, by keeping the media shut down, they can do everything they think they're supposed to do without punishment.
“No one knows anything, ” wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as the key source of restraint and equality in public life.
“Political policies themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to the fold and assembly,” he wrote.
The Chinese legislators were a mixture of public anger and in the past.
In May they voted for the abolition of the reductions appointed by the National Payment Commission and for the recovery of their huge salary, which is about 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
A new cost line will appear in the municipal payments of the enemy, which will be calculated on the capital of the house.
The nearest estimates for the standard two-bedroom apartment from the new year are to be paid from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The Government of the region will determine the exact rules.
So when you pick up a ride, bring in the wooden cells, or even replace the elevator, you will decide for yourself.
This law has been approved by members of the field of thought.
Vladimir Klučnikov, President of the Voronej area, said: "In this case, we also have to set the order - to set the house order, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which are often registered in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or somewhere, it will set up public control over the cost of the funds collected by residents to repair multi-s private homes."
Under State control, construction is now under way.
The law protecting the muslims is approved in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty space.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been injured by the unjust mobs.
Most problems have been solved.
In fact, the new law prescribes the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the construction.
Vladimir Klučnikov, President of the Voronej area, said: “It is not a secret that abuses in this area also began in the 98s, and in the 2000s the same donors. ”
People started working to close the laser, including those two laws.
Under Voronjem, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign citizens who were eligible for deportation.
The Regional Parliament has adopted such a law not only under the auspices of the Federation.
The problem with illegal migrants in the region, however, can be solved.
Yes, in the past year, there have been some 100,000 foreigners on the migration account.
But only every fifth had formal permission to work.
Where the rest of them work and whether they pay taxes is a big issue.
Vladimir Klučnikov, President of the Voronej area, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
The court doesn't have to deport - they have to have somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the federation that, through regional funds, such facilities would be equipped.
In the Voroneje region, such a place is defined as the Old Olysanca of the Samila region.
Well, the regional parliament later granted new benefits to many parents.
First, families with 5 and more children are fully exempt from transport taxes.
The budget is lost by 3.5 million -- but so many parents are economical.
Secondly, and this is the main one who will take the 3rd and smaller, since the new year, will grant housing subsidies.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a cost of 30 thousand feet.
The family, for example, of the 6 people - the father, the mother, the baby and the third.
For them, according to the rules, the State acquires a living area of 108 square metres - 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West micro-area, a completely acceptable option.
Well, at the center of this amount, you can buy a whole box already.

U.S. Secretary-General: staff have been “too far” from data collection
The Secretary of State of the United States John Kerry acknowledged that the US Special Service ' s data and hearings had been “too far away”, but he noted that information on the hearing of 70 million people in the media did not match the reality.
I assure you that innocent people have not suffered during this process, but they have been trying to collect information.
Yes, in some cases it was too far away and was wrong.
I recognize this as the President, and we will follow it in the future," says the AFP Secretary.
Italian station workers are on the way for young people
The Italian unemployment rate is recorded.
The average data revealed that 12.5 per cent of the country's population were unemployed.
Such evils have not existed since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is a few times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement for older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide an early retirement pension for staff.
On the other hand, Italy is looking forward to Europe ' s problem with the elderly.
And the economists are not convinced that pre-term rotation is justified.
What will the construction of the TTU in Moscow lead to?
With each year, the capital authorities promised to build more transport-transmitters (TAFs).
It is planned to insert 255 TSOs by 2020.
As far as the project is concerned, our correspondence is clear.
A few months ago, a construction assembly was held in the Molenska metro Arbatsko-Pakrov.
The signature stated that the transport-transmitter belt was being fitted.
All of this was very strange, since, in addition to Smolens, there is no land transport remaining, and therefore there is no way to cross it.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Saad bridge, it is necessary to cross some 130 metres, including the ground crossing through the Karmanic crossing.
Now it's almost over with Smolens.
Out of the blue light, the wall was laid out for the gas, and the asphalt was transformed into a brush.
Here's the whole truck.
Transport-transmitter belts are flat and capital - explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
No capital TPs yet.
The platforms, however, are intended to build parks, to create commercial facilities that interfere with passenger movement, to create small architecture and well-being.
Of course, the PSTs are not even employed by carriers, but professional beneficiaries from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport vehicle is not necessarily a complex structure, explained by the Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy of the High School of Economics, Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes there are enough crossings over the head and table to announce the time of the arrival of the transport.
For example, there was recently opened a fully-fledged flat-rolled bridge at the Yassava metro.
Let's have no shoes, but with the absorbing parking lots and a table indicating when the bus arrives.
But the number of officials in the U.S.A.'s been recording everything that happened to us.
In 2011, Maria planned to build a total of 151 buildings, 59 of which had capital buildings.
Currently, up to 255 WFPs are planned by 2020.
Half of them promised to give up this year.
Although there is no quality criteria for the development of the TITU in the city, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the City and Transport Public Organisation.
The number of objects is calculated, but the quality of transfer on each of them is often impaired.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first, lowering the time of transfer, second, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the type of transport without rain.
In Moscow, time is running out when the TTU is installed.
A bright example of the "VDNH".
Former railway buses with the Yaroslav Shos came to the fore in front of the main entrance to the WVC.
Now their positions have been transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the streets of Cosmonauts.
Far from the metro, far from the monarchy, so it's closer to the living house.
Since the inhabitants didn't want cars under the windows, they complained at all possible stations.
With the capital TTU in Moscow, it didn't happen at any time.
The first of them started building five years ago in the "Planerna" subway.
The project was designed to be an example.
Indeed, there has been an example of how the transfer-backed surplus paid to investors is converted into a bonal trading centre.
No, there's a bus stop here, a train to avoid going from the subway under the rain, and three stages of the bus.
True, the chemical trolleybus No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPU did not give the place in principle.
They've been driven away from the subway by strangers.
That's why there's more places to trade.
It's just one of 32 stores, and there's almost all of them from the zoo to the car.
Well, in fact, who else from the bus passengers would have to buy a new car on the way?
When they build a capital TTU, we always get a trading center.
The situation has recently reached its logical conclusion when some of the automobiles have decided to be placed on the market.
Now, in the third phase of the "Planer" TTU among those marked on the ground floor, there is war on trade.
The sheep, the specialties, the Chinese genes, the nervous word and the guards who look at our photograph badly.
The trans-shipment was finally converted into the base.
The fact that it was a market at the Planner's metro earlier, but it got out.
And in the prefecture of the traders, they appealed and left the trans-shipment park.
It's always empty because of high prices.
It's funny that the market has come up with to build a new flat-rate TP in its place.
That's how it's done.
The distance from the subway to the bus was 50 metres from the Caluji Metro, as described by Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trading centre, the TTU cables increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, he has to be treated under the open sky.
In addition, the constructions of the "Planner" and "Calusca" will soon be shown by flowers.
In mid-September, the Meridian Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPs.
Four of them will be 25-year-old without two-thirds of underground roses.
The main monster will grow in the "Tushino" metro, which will have 418.7 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railways of the RJDs responsible for the construction of the Metro TRU have already told journalists: in future multi-ethnic shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials believe that multi-stakeholder parks need from three to a half of the area.
Let's take the example of "national" garages.
It is said that the garage on 258 parking places, which have recently been built on the International Street, has a area of 8015 square meters.
So for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars in Petrovso-Rasomov, about 80,000 square miles will be needed.
It's less than a third of the machine that's going to be built there.
Let one or two stages go to every bus stop.
There are at least 150 thousand square kilometres of commercial inviolability.
And that's, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the capital TTUs are built at stations and stations, the rest of the fleets will be trained by metropolitics.
They also promised that there would be a lot of "functional assignments", including hotels, offices and even sports events.
In fact, in Moscow's department of property, journalists have recently been carrying out a draft regulation that allows investors to seek a place for TITU directly for officials.
No competitions.
Therefore, he asked that transport issues for the city was a priority.
The perfect TPU is, for example, the Garvard station in Boston or the Spadena in Toronto, a trusted Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybus and trams are dropped below the ground at the level of the meter and the distance from the train to the tramway is 50 metres away from the road.
There's no other trade around.
But Moscow officials are finally breaking up.
We're either going to build anything, or we're running out of 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser suggests comparing patriotism with extremism
In order to provide legal protection for the patriotial feelings of citizens against Russia, the "Justice of Russia" suggests that it be equal to the abuse of patriotism to extremist activities and imprisonment for five years.
As reported in the Newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the thought-finding Committee on Energy by Olego Miheev have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under patriotism, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the human emotional relationship with the country in which he is a citizen of the country, who is responsible for its judgment, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic law imposes sanctions on the formal signs of the government by flag and herb.
In the view of the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, which may be subject to public symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is insufficient in Russian law.
As an example, it leads to the annual Day of the Win of the Discussion, when some media persons are allowed to question the heroic role of the SSR people in the fight against fascists.
The launch of the main national festival - Day of the victory of 9 May - is in progress every year.
Excited by the island and by the "alternative view" of history, some publishers come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, the Germans did not conquer the Soviet Union!
I think it is absolutely unacceptable in the country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual strength” of the nation, Oleg Miheev is quoted.
In addition, Micah said that the patriarchal people in Russia are much more than religious, but this law condemns the offending of believers, and it is possible that patriot feelings can be hurt virtually without punishment.
In the view of the national elector, it is necessary to compare patriotism with extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for the punishment of patriotism: from 100 thousand to 5 years of imprisonment.
The magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the city of Cokimbo, central Chile, by Reuters.
The eye of earthquakes was located in the ocean at 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, which is indicated on the U.S. Geological Service website (USGS).
These were fixed at 20:03 at local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
There is no mention of the victims or those caused by subterfuge.
Remember, Chile is one of the most seismo - active areas of the earth, so it is not rare to land on it.
One of the most serious events took place in 2010.
The magnitude 8.8 earthquake and its tsunami killed more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220,000 buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in Chile took place in the new history: a magnitude 9.5 was found there in 1960.
The natural disaster resulted in more than 5,000 deaths.
Ms. Medvedev: Greenpeace will be judged fairly
Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be considered strictly in accordance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be considered in compliance with the law, and we will hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Ero.
Among the detained activists, Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Peru Pisanu, like the rest of the activists, have been charged with imprisonment.
"I asked if we could expect humanitarian violence against a detained citizen," Mr. Ero quoted as Mr. RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one can violate the law,” Dmitry Medvedev said in turn.
According to him, the activities of any structures that are trying to influence technologically complex and dangerous processes, including the acquisition of energy providers, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “as a garbage dump” and recalled what happened in the Mexican Gulf, transmitted the RIA News.
UN declares new poverty eradication goals
The United Nations must immediately begin its work on a new set of Millennium Development Goals that have been developed 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australia's diplomats played a key role in promoting "Sustainable Development Goals" in the CRT exchange, which would take place in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro was launched at night.
They were included in the outcome version of the document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Hillard, at the time of the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ghi Mun told the summit that the time had come to “stand above national interests”.
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of establishing the universal objectives of sustainable development, the CSD”, he said.
These CSDs will be based on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, becoming an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers I have been given by the Member States to implement our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the successful implementation of the ICT.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the status of Samori Mahela, president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan the world's peace legends on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Suss, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed the business suit on a football field, enhanced by the Portuguese title “We Require Security” and joined in the fourth floor of the capital, Independence Square.
Within two weeks, virtually every day reports of encounters between the government forces and Renamo were one of the most violent encounters since the end of the war more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a known rebel movement supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then by the Government of South Africa, apartheid in efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After his death in 1992, he became an opposition party.
Analyticals believe that the country is about to resuscitate into a full-scale conflict, but recent developments have hindered foreign investors and local residents.
High rates for the fast-growing economy, as the opening of large greenhouse gas stocks and coal sites in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party Frelimo, the leader of the political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accused each other of the tension that had been created.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has become the founder of the last round, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional territory of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels were followed when the government forces attacked the base of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, the representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo on the initiation of talks, accusing the party of an attack on the military.
President Armando Gebuza has tried to address the threat of instability.
He said to the French intelligence agency AFP that Mr. Dhlakam felt as a failure, who wanted to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after the announcement that Mazanga had declared a refusal to withdraw from the 1992 Peace Agreement.
He reported that he had not complied with the Frelimo Party's agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously,” said Mazang.
Previous negotiations between the parties had little to do to reduce the tension that has intensified the series of interviews this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama), spoken with tongues,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
Neither is a good negotiator, nor is one of them willing to take the necessary steps.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the following year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to achieve the Government's access to and financial bonus.
The proportion of the votes for Renamo has been reduced since 1992, while the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) party, which was based on the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebusa, who had to leave the post the following year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the president's post," said Mazang.
It is unclear what opportunities Renamo has had, but she has already carried out devastating and intense attacks on police stations and on key automobiles from the north to the south.
Most of the villages were located in the province of Sofala, a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but included the port of Beirut, which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.
In June Rio stopped using rail routes about a week after Renamo was threatened by an attack on the railway.
Masanga was shocked when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique were not going very well”, Mazang said.
The instability has intensified the government's discontent, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that responsibility for future countries has a Government and a president who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultwan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the streets," he said.
A series of top Art Mainstrim films will be held in Moscow.
A series of Art Mainstrim films, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their departure to the proquet, will go to the Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA "Newsty" with reference to project organizers.
Opens the Art Mainstrema programme, a French comedian director and actress Reim Kerici, "Price any price".
This is the story of the French capital of the Maye model (Kerici alone) which is deported to the family by visa problems in Morocco.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also show a new picture of the so-called South Korean director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", melodramatic biopic Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Canary Film Festival "Jijn Adele" Abdeltif Keshi.
The only Russian "Art-Minister" will be the winner of the "Kinotavre" film of the "Geograph Globe" by Alexander Ivanov for the reasons of the same novel.
The main role of the successful teacher, Victor Service, was to play in the film by Constantine Habenski, whose work was also marked by the award of Kintovar.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of the model of life”, says the author.
The statement of Tore could show that “the grave power cannot overcome the tense rush”, while the legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Speaking of the fact that many myths are “too thick, too scandalous and, in some cases, too inappropriate for teaching in schools,” Crossley Holland speaks for “a team” suitable for the age of texts.
“I think it’s amazing that in America muffins and follicles are already part of education,” he said.
I have asked them to be included in the twenty-year course.
He added that the “extraordinary morality” of authors and teachers “takes interest” in children, and the main ideas “simulated” in educational history.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beovulf from English-Saxon, as well as the Norwegian Miffo Collection for the publication of Penguin and the British People's Stories, said: “You may have intentions, but you better keep them with you.”
Perhaps the great difference between the adult author written for the adults and the adult author written for the children is that there is a need to feel certain hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or brought to a happy conclusion, but that there must be an understanding of good and evil.
And this must be subliminal; it is revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Voroneje area, a football fan was held that broke the window in the waiting room
At nine o'clock in the evening, two football fans, trainers from Moscow, were fired from the passenger train at the Griasi-Vorne police station on 29 October.
On his way to a favorite team, the boys set up a drinking hole on the way.
Young people had been brought to the district of the police station in Graz to produce a protocol on administrative crime.
Fantasies broke up in their antisocial behavior.
The police provided them with administrative material and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next trip and were waiting for his arrival at the station.
In the first half of the night, the fans left the railway building, but one of them, 22 - year - old boy suddenly came back and broke the door into the waiting room.
On the side of the broken glass, the transport police officer and the CPD RJD security officer were fired.
They were able to arrest a criminal who tried to hide from the scene.
A verification is carried out by the South-East LLU RSD staff in Russia.
The issue of incitement to criminal proceedings was addressed by the senior information and public relations representative of the South-East LWW in Russia on the transport of Sergei Olkhovic.
Vitaly Mutko: Do you remember?
I think we've been back for 15 years.
Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the irregularity of the tribunals at the time of the "Spartak" match in Cuba, Russia.
I am a party to the responsibility of sports organizers for all of this: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they took a firm position.
They're waiting for someone to come by and order.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite right.
In order to organize patients, the clubs should invite their friends, rather than leave the case on their own.
We have now developed a Government special regulation on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
After it has been adopted, we will take this issue seriously.
But I am still obliged to invite all football organizers.
I read Leonida Fedun's interview.
State, please, give me the law.
It feels like it's the Bavari patients who came to Yaroslavl and put it all in order.
And we're side observers.
And it's really terrible to see how the tribunal gets out of Brandspoy.
And it's in a country that's ready for the World Championship.
"I feel like we've been back 10-15 years," said Mutko.
They may be asked in Russia.
American Special Service Officer Edward Snouden will not, at least, go beyond the borders of Russia to give evidence of hearing of the telephone negotiations of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a representative of the German Genital Office could answer questions in writing or in Russian.
The exit of Edward Snouden outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses refugee status and may be handed over to Washington by the U.S. allies," the agency's associate said.
“However, in principle, the FRG Genocortate could send its representatives to the FF or transmit written questions to Snouden,” the source added, adding that this matter should be addressed at the intergovernmental level.
Former German Bundesta Hans-Christian Strebelle reported that Edward Snouden was ready to give a presentation on the case of hearings by the American negotiating services of the German Chancellor.
It was intended to provide evidence to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The C.R.'s ex-employer realized that he knew so much.
Although the United States ABB has blocked all its movements, Snouden is ready to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions of his arrival," said the Euronews TV station.
Snoudena Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source of the Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when he would decide on his own.
U.S. citizen Edward Snouden, who worked at the National Security Agency (NAB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after having published information on the secret operations of United States Internet tracking services.
A hit plane via the Moscow Transit, but was unable to leave the airport because its passport had been cancelled by the US authorities, who usually charged it with serious charges, and until the beginning of August remained in the Transit Area of the Sheremetevo Airport.
On August 1st, Snouden received a document providing him with temporary asylum in the territory of Russia for a period of one year and that same day he left Shermetevo.
American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated yesterday that his client had been working in a "big Russian company".
German media reported a follow-up to the ABB for Angelo Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the U.S. Chancellor’s telephone negotiations began to be heard in 2002.
The post office was in the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities stated after the publication of these statements that the trace for Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
I've noticed the remainder of the Justice of Russia.
A member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilia Ponnomarev, made a statement on departure from the political organization.
As the parliament had said, he had made a statement in the new Regional Office of the Party.
According to her constitution, this automatically means that Ponnomarev has left a number of "students".
We sit down, drink tea...
"Why do many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponnomarev is on the table," but there is nothing like this," the MP commented on his decision.
He noted that he maintained good relations with the Regional Office of the “Essor”.
In the meantime, Mr Ilia Ponnomarev's mandate was rejected.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the group and could not get out of it under the law.
The announcement of the intention of Eli Ponomareva to leave the “Russian Justice” party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Hudkov and Valerie Zuubov were coming out with him, but the information was soon discovered.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDA Foumio Kisida met the Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergey Lavre, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to exchange views on the further development of political dialogue on matters related to the conclusion of the peace treaty”, he said at the meeting of Kisida.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Sindzo Abbe visited Russia, relations between countries became more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RFF would meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protest actions in Tokyo are being carried out today, demanding the return of the countries lost after the Second World War.
There are machines in Japan’s capital, which are said by the speaker, “Werni northern Territories.”
The police don't stop the protesters, they're watching to keep the noise going.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said with courage that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedian in America: almost a hundred years ago, an extraterrestrial artist, Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre Theatre in Broadway, began to tell the audience directly in the conversation.
In time, Faya's innovation was under attack by others, quite recently - New York's comedy festival.
The Carolyn Hersh, founder of the Carolina Club, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than six hundred shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these hackers started in Carolinas and then gained greater success, reaching the level when they were already too prominent to speak at the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to keep working with them.
This year, the event includes the presentations of Wendy Sieks, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the “Stendap for heroes” as well as the annual musical comedian charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, which will take place among the others Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Walters and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expanded, the comedian world was expanding.
Several Comedy Central, FX and Spike, who participated in this year's festival, have gained popularity through a non-traditional way, such as a show on small-scale Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll was informed by the role of a comedian series on a small-known cable television (the "Liga" of FXX on the subject of fantasy football) and is now taking his own show at the Comedy Central.
Jenny Slight came into the actor's composition both on Saturday evenings in direct ephere, as well as in the Parks and Respiration Zones, although she was best known for the series of viral Roles of Marsell-Rucks in Botnics.
And Croll, and Sleet, as well as other young comedians with self - style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a bad focus on the racial theme of Camau Bell), is the result of the decentralised peace of the American comedian.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a standp comic, but then he became a successful director of television and film, as well as an informal story of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the director of a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the central element of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he would sometimes play a game between the two houses and say, "If I stay here without money, I might live here."
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities started negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This has been reported by the delegation of this country in Britain, where Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with which he discussed Pakistan and India, the world energy market and the economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that a dialogue with the Taliban movement had begun, says a statement by the Pakistani Embassy in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same Afghan movement, but are acting independently of them in the northern and western regions of the country bordering with Afghanistan.
Pakistani talismans are being created by the Islamic State.
In the past, the Government of Islam had tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had declined from dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would only take place if the authorities took the place of a permanent dislocation of troops located in areas where the Taliban were operating, as well as released from the detention of the Islamic prisoners.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Economic Forum for Islam.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Government of Pakistan and Afghan President Hamid Carzay, held a three-party meeting in London, where the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan were discussed.
Oil dropped at $96 per barrel.
The price for oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the education of large stocks were brought to an end by a communication indicating that China's energy-producing sector was taking power.
The Italian oil cut in December achieved 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 for a late European morning in electronic markets at the New York Stock Exchange.
In the fourth contract, 39 cents were awarded, which resulted in a drop in prices by 5.8 per cent in October.
The wealth of oil has affected her value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy said that the United States stocks increased to 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over 25 million barrels were filled in five weeks.
However, on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand by a judge in two reports on the Chinese industry that demonstrated the extent of its activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery can continue to take effect after the third quarter ' s growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent, an essential international oil product used by oil-processing companies in the United States, amounted to $26,108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Colonel Patrick Rua, the main trainer in Colorado, explaining the decision to release the first-minute golfer seed of Varlamov in a five-minute match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the last night of the race did not undermine his confidence in the rose, passed from Dallas the phrase "SE" to Natalia Shmeleva.
And what are we waiting for?
Of course, all of us are worried, but we trust him and feel that it will be good for him to go on ice today.
We want him to go up to the ice and show his usual level.
Are you absolutely sure that the situation has never been described in the circumstances of the buyer?
It's here today and I see it.
Our games will no doubt support Varley to help him keep the door as it was in the previous games of this season.
Most importantly, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court is informed of the situation.
There is no need to be vegan in Siberia: a hot tomato will not replace the soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, the RIA News correspondent explained.
People who have completely abandoned products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
There is no cold here without damage to their health, and no warm shelters compensate them for the threat of New York’s New York Times and Doctors Day.
Drink oil with litres
Strong vegetarianism, when rejected not only by meat and fish, but also by milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dentists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities, there are strict rules on eating, at least for health reasons.
The full refusal of animal products is worth it.
Animal proteins contain unchanged amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for plants.
It must be compulsory to include in the race, whether milk or eggs,” confident diethologist Marina Godi.
It is an example of a fish containing Omega-3 unchanged fatty acid.
Their riches are olive oil, and it is bitter.
"To need it in the quantities necessary for man, it needs litres to drink," says a dietist.
The doctors are convinced that the people of Siberia need to pay particular attention to the harvest.
In this season vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
There are high requirements for food in our realities.
In order not to freeze, increased calories are needed.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, he does not deserve this calorie," said a specialist.
That's what Dr. Olga Poznack agrees with.
It adds that imported fruit and fruit are not coming out.
It is better to ask the person about products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to improve the use and circulation of these products.
And the green people don't want to warm up, but the hot tub or something else," explains the doctor's position.
According to her, there may be vegans, which are currently useful for various evils, cattle, cattle, local fruit, apples, frozen eggs.
But that, of course, is not enough for a full diet.
According to Dr. Clavdie Arifulin, the syphilis in vitamins are only sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete shift to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions when the temperature may change by 30 degrees, and in May the snow is unintended.
Life's organization needs energy, and that's, first of all, iron," says medicine.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly valuable to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by maintaining vegetarianism, we give them little value.
The pellets are also needed in the increased content of whites, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
"The refugees don't touch them," said God.
Arifulina says that an adult wants to choose everything that is appropriate, "to play in the toys that he wants."
He's already formed the organism, the skeleton, the organs.
And children still need to be asked in full.
If parents leave him behind some microelements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will be, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
"The lack of other substances for brain development, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All medical experts interviewed are of the opinion that the low quality of the seeds produced in the heat and imported fruit and fruit.
What is brought to us and heated in heat is less of the micro-elements we need than (reduced) in the open ground.
"The quality of products is not that," God says.
Arifulin also notes that imported and hot fruits and fruits are far from ideal standards.
The desire of manufacturers to collect more fruit causes quality damage.
"The leaves do not become corrosive on the edge, the bees quickly want and bloom, the bees are delicious and non-aromatic," adding that they are printed in a large amount of favors.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
It is not in harmony with this agreement by the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology for Agricultural Problems, a farmer of the science of Vera Petruk.
She said that, in the right manner and in compliance with all the rules and requirements in the heat, it was possible to develop complete fruit.
If you try to get more out of the square meter, you'll end up swimming more often, and recharging your crops with mineral improvements.
For example, when too much acidity is abundant, the soils are rapidly growing, they are large but watery and poor," she explains, adding that the quality issue is primarily dependent on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court ceased to implement the decision on the practice of “remaining” in New York Police Department
In the fourth appeal court of the Federal District ceased to comply with a judicial decision requiring changes in the program to "stop and search" of the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The Second District Appeal Court of the United States stated that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shiri Shendlin would be suspended before the results of the appeal submitted by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city appealed for its decision and its corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint a controller to assist the police department in modifying its work practices and related training programmes.
In the fourth appeal court heard a dispute between the parties on the application for a suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeal declared the need to remove the judge because she violated the Code of Conduct of the U.S. judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid demonstrations of initiative, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements that contained a public response to the court's criticism.
The judge decided that the police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, calling on black and Latin Americans on the program “to stop and search”.
It has appointed an external monitor for the monitoring of major changes that include policy, education and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot test programme on video cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons whose cases were terminated after the police investigation.
The city appeal shall be held after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of “remaining and searching” have been criticised by many lawyers on civil rights.
“Research” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically with the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 persons, most of whom were black and Latin Americans in 2011.
In 2004, four persons, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective appeal.
The parties to the "stop and search" programme in New York police departments say that these changes put an end to poor practice, create a more reliable and effective police service and can affect how other police departments implement this practice.
The opposition claimed that the changes would lower the war spirit of the police rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money spending and do not address the global problem of the complex conditions in the police due to a reduction in the number of officers over the last few thousand years.
The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of “remaining and searching” which was in conformity with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York police remained.
A walking zone was opened in the area of the Trinity Gallery
In Moscow a new walk zone has emerged.
It is located in the area of the Tritejako Gallery and takes part in two kilometres from the Metro station Novokoznetskya to the Bolott Square.
All along, street showerers, flowers, shoes, urine and toilets have been set up and illegal advertising has been removed.
In addition to the climate and the Lavruzin revolution, which were already on the way, five streets of the Ordinance were closed, the Grand and Little Tolmachevian Revolution, the Kaddeev Conservative and Bolott Square.
The traffic on the streets of Morocco and Petrovka is not limited.
On the 5th Street from New York to the Climate Change Station, conditions for walking have been created without stopping movement and crossing the passageway, transmits newsmsk.com.
Within the walk zone were the Trinity, the temple of the pope of Rome, the museum, libraries, monuments, and other monuments.
Previously, the entire pedestrians had become the Tver, the Roofs and the Kuznetsky Bridge Street.
The Greater Dmitrovk, where the walking zone was opened early in September, was decided to close the exit and holiday cars.
Coulson fled to the cell phone to check confidential communications
The former editor of the World News of the Andy Colson used “telephone, sequence and resistance” in an attempt to refute the false information about the Roman Charles Clark, who was then in office as the Minister of Home Affairs.
The prosecutor, King's lawyer, Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World had received unconfirmed news that Clark was meeting with his “Intelligent Special Adviser” Hann Polby.
The newspaper ordered a private detective, Glenna Mulkeir, to attack Polby’s voice mail and warn her at home to get an interview, but Koulson also called her and left her voice, ” the court heard.
“The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person who will stand behind something in the house hoping to stand up for someone who likes to offer people a story to see what they say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspaper News of the World used three ways of investigating history: telephone abuse, harassment and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the next, he just owes.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone damage?
He says, "No, we will say, "Yes."
The audiences of Roman Clarka first drew attention to the edition of News of the World, when the source of sexual interest in Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she and Charles."
The tape with the voice messages received from her phone at least three times was withdrawn from the house of Mulkeir in August 2006.
The followers also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Miss Polby and her sister described as “Projects”.
During the period during which she was in custody, Mrs. Polby's grandmother and grandmother received anonymous calls asking for information, Mr. Edis said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Türlbeck and former reporter James Usherap were monitoring the follow-up to Ms. Polby's movement.
Having left her a vote on 18 June 2005, Colson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that the Coulson's participation in this story was the same scenario as with other influential individuals, such as former Interior Minister David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blancett on Roman marriage with a married woman while he himself met with Rebecca Brooks, then married.
Coulson and Brooks refused to enter into a conversation with other people with a view to breaking the telephone between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeier, Türlbeck, and Uzerape were admitted to a telephone breach.
Snouden is ready to communicate with the FRG authorities in case of an appeal
CRU ex-employer Edward Snouden expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as possible, and to meet with the representatives of the FRG authorities, he transmits the RIA News.
The letter of the former CRU official to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin was submitted on Friday by the Bundesta of Hans-Christian Strebel, through which Snoudden sent a message to the German authorities.
The threat was met by Snoudden in Moscow.
Four people were injured by a fire on the Tver Street.
As a result of the fire in a collector's room in the centre of Moscow on the Tver Street, four others were injured.
As Interfax reports with reference to the source of extra services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, the past has been affected by fire during the underground earthquake.
According to RIA News with reference to the head of the capital of the fuel and energy industry department of Paul Livinski, electricity is now fully restored in all homes on the Tver Street.
The fire in the heat collector's home on the Tver Street occurred on evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke from the lyrical canal, and in the underground transition in Armenia, there was an earthquake.
As a result of the fires, 11 houses were burned on the Tver Street.
At 21:45 in Moscow, fire was eliminated.
The United States of America provides food aid for the poor
Food allowance for the family of four persons is reduced to $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of products known as “footsteps” is reduced as the action of the relevant public programme is completed.
The family's food allowance of four will now be $36 a month less than before. Officials will speak.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to the Reuters agency, financial aid for one person in 2012 amounted to an average of $133 per month.
Food aid costs in the United States increased to $80 billion a year due to unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans rely on the free food aid provided by foottimes, which has been called from earlier times when they had the form of wallets.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans of the Congress require further reductions in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
Food stores throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
Congressmen in the United States continue to dispute how further funding could be reduced.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
The Blizzard study released its 1994 Blackthorne platform free of charge on PC.
That's what the WoW Insider reports.
According to his data, the game became available in Battle.net in the classic game Blizzard.
However, some geymers point out that only users who are involved in the American service are able to jump at this moment.
The game is still unavailable for Russian users.
As media transmits, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC does not differ externally from the original game option.
Soundtrack to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, went up to the SNES console.
Its events were unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and bright kingdoms.
On one occasion, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlarosa Kyle, who was rescued from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to confront the Saralaks and protect them from the planet’s predators.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the study released after being renamed at the Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, she was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was the company Interplay.
New cars appear in the Moscow Metropolis.
But selling tickets by passengers will not be for money, but for meetings.
One trip at 30 rubles is for a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will be taken into account through modern technology, reports ITARA-TASS, referring to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first equipment will be installed at the “Exit” station on 8 November 2013.
The president of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Jukov and the Olympic Championships of Alexei Namov and Elena Zamoldchikov, will be presenting new tickets.
The Agency ' s recognition of national security enhances the paradigm of corporations with respect to public record
At the end of August, a German police helicopter flew down to the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
Under the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, the task was to photograph the collapse of the United States Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to detect the antennas of listening devices, and these actions had led to negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Klapper, Director of National Intelligence of the United States, reiterated in September that the United States does not use the possibility of external intelligence “to attract foreign business secrets for American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
However, since Edward Snouden, a contract employee who became a publisher, has begun to publish his secretarial of the United States of America, the European governments and corporate leaders are no longer convinced of the fact that he can be trusted by word.
It was reported that the National Security Agency of the United States had followed Petrobra ' s oil company in Brazil and had access to data stored by United States coastal service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the flagship corporation of the following State to new heights.
The last capillary was reported to have been heard by Angel Merkel's cell phone for some ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a mouse, of course, the potential mice are also business leaders.
Snoden has made evident intensive cooperation between the United States intelligence services and companies.
I think it's quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany should be asked,” says Oliver Green, president of the BITMI Association, representing Germany's small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in industrial spying and data collection, according to a study published in July by the EY advisory agency.
However, in all the documents that Mr. Snoudene had made available, there was still no evidence that the United States had transmitted the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policies expressed concern that the EU did not take advantage of certain opportunities in information technology and the Internet and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are scathingly involved.
Someone in the German Parliament says we must create a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not a option,” says Gusso Plattner, president of the German software company for SAP business.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not be allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything will be subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT industries.
Nevertheless, the technical development of US spy agencies, known as the discovery of Snoudene, was also a shock to some companies who previously thought that China was the greatest risk of traceability.
A great deal is happening in rural technologies where the leaders of European companies have been better aware that the data contained in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the U.S. Coast Guard after the release of the American Data Analysis Programme for Prism.
Jim Snowb, one of the Executive Directors of the SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new issue that didn’t occur years ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are merely a confirmation that they have already known: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be kept at any price.
What is happening in economic spying is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not significantly changed in the current Polish language,” says Kurt Bok, chief executive director of the BASF Chemicals Company.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because it is in our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporation leaders usually do not like to be ashamed of the responsible measures they have taken, as this may provide the advantage of the opponent.
In large companies, it has long been thought that taking a free flash at the exhibition or leaving a notebook with no view to the room’s number is, at least, invisible.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automobile Company, says that it has been standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before government meetings so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Institute for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that business managers consider using simple mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The mobile phones are then released.
However, there is a threat that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to injuries and injuries.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific lows.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns the BfV report.
The United States dollar warns its own economic spy companies from other countries.
The United States National Intelligence Association in February replaced France with Russia and Israel in the second series of violations committed by the hacker for economic investigation, then China, The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic spying, “France is worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsin, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a youth from Georgia who died in a “bad case” believe that their son had been killed
The parents of a teenage in Georgia, whose body was found inside a stolen sports mother in his high school gym, believe that their son had been killed, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Waldo City, Georgia, was found on January 11th in the vertical mother, who was assigned back to the tribunes in his high school sports hall.
Follow-up to the district sheriff Loundes concluded that Johnson died on a tragic occasion, but the 17-year-old family disagrees.
“They are absolutely convinced that their son has been killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff says.
“They think this is contrary to logic, laws of physics, and good sense,” Kramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect people or people responsible for their son's death.
They sent their son to school with a bag of books, and brought him back to the fold for the corpses."
American lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remain unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Muror made a press conference on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts they'd bring us.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds for formal investigation,” he said.
Mur told the reporters that the first resurrection showed that Johnson died as a result of the “positional asfixion”.
However, the second resurrection, said Mura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Mur added that if he found a sufficient role to require a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Director of the district of Loundes was not available for the comment when he was called on Thursday.
The Justice of South Georgia, in the middle, has ordered the authorities to publish all video footage of the surveillance cameras that have been watched by the investigators.
The parents of adolescents said that they hoped that video recordings contained the key to the delay in his death.
"Spartacus": Information on persons who have taken the fascist symbol
The official website Spartacus made a statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of the tribunal in Yaroslavla of the Fascist flag.
On October 30th, unknown prosecutors at the stadium in Yaroslavle showed a fascist symbol.
We appeal to all who have confidential information on persons who have committed this criminal offence to provide it
"Remuneration is guaranteed," said the statement.
The same fans who took the Fascist flag to Yaroslav
We remember that in March 1/16, Cuba's "Sinnik" -- "Spartak" -- several times -- broke down because of the irregularity of the tribunes.
A fascist symbol was also displayed in the Spartacus hospital sector.
Spartacus may be punished by about three dead persons without sight.
The Committee will meet on Friday.
If you have information about the person who passed and took this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergic to children
In the middle of the disease control and prevention centres, a list of recommendations on the control of food allergy in school children was published.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the Government of the United States, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergy is growing.
Now there's food allergy in one of the 20 children in the United States.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the distribution of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for the school on how to raise awareness of educators and food Allergic personnel in children and how to provide assistance in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenaline storage — most often used for injections by an automatic EpiPen medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative authorities have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to save adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It's like a feeling about my language," "I have hair in my tongue" or "the language of my lips".
The parents of intersexual children can choose “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third generation of children born with inter-ethnic sex organs.
Newborns will no longer be obliged to sign male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any half of such children by allowing parents to indicate the gender as “undefined” or “unset” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could take prompt decisions on sexual harassment and to combat discrimination against persons of intersex.
According to BBC, one person said many years ago, "I am not a man nor a woman".
I'm gonna be a doctor-in-chief with blues and scars.
About one of the 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have an intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual development” — a collective term for people with typical chromosomes, gondolas (or seeds) or otherwise developed armed sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
Gender identification has not yet been studied sufficiently, but most experts in the United States have said that if the field cannot be determined, it would be better to use all available information and attract it than to expect and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation is carried out.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemmas.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You can assign a field without surgery and then see how a person develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It's like a reminder of why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as distinct from transsexual or transgender because they are not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female sex and is typical of both at the same time or not of any of them.
These characteristics may be expressed in secondary sex signs such as muscle mass, hair cover, breast and body weight distribution; primary sex signs such as reproductive organs and genetics, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as of the level of stress, violence and crime on the grounds of prejudice.
Boys with gender exclusion now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June 52, the Australian resident, Norry May-Walby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “free” person to remain in court for “undefined” sex status for the rest of his life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a third sign in addition to M and F to X will be used in German passports is sexual.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still in conflict, according to France's news release on Canal 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this clearly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “generical theory” from school teachers.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is in a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more stages of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported on the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to set up a sex at birth.
“Strengthen the child sufficiently hard and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know half of your child”, she said to the parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historic children born to male and female sex organs were referred to as hemaphrodites — in the name of a beautiful Greek god, who had both sexes.
And ten years ago, the medical community understood the gender as a letter that could be preserved and then replanted.
But now many argue about ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and sometimes the doctor makes an unwise choice, not knowing how a child will understand his gender when he is growing up.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called "an emergency psychiatric case," Dresher said.
When these children were born, you called no psychiatrist — you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to deal with children with intergenerational types was proposed by Dr. John Mani of the University of Johns Hopkins, who felt that gender was changing easily.
He introduced the term “general identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social, as parents grow children, interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether man or woman would be considered to be male or female.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were under question.
He advised the boy’s parents that the penis had been damaged during an emergency, that the child would be completely cast out, that he would cut off his eggs, and that he would grow up as a girl.
"My case was a successful example of transition, but that was not so," Dresher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But he committed suicide in 38 years.
Dresher said that some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet coming, people who survived these sex-change operations said that they were “unsatisfied”.
That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but an intermediate type.
The doctor was unable to determine exactly whether he had a large clinic or a small pension and was convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life ” for men.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, the outside body and the bride of Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was diagnosed with vaginoplasty.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genetic development.
Once he learned the truth, he again became a man, got a testosterone arm, and broke his chest.
The operation made him useless.
Today it is in the protection of others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring people into normal contact with sex.
But Ann Tumar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Law Association Advocates for Reported Choice, is concerned that the German law “incentives the pursuit of wealth and prosperity”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and give the child an “undefined sex”, she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.
We think it's better to have sex or sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law comes into existence, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices for the benefit of the third sex”.
“ Adults must have the opportunity to make their own decisions on formal sex,” she said.
The German law meant its adoption at birth.
This is a conflict in which little children must not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
However, Dr. Arlin Barac, a piptsburgh mammologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
Daughter Barac, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she had a sexual development disorder called “a syndrome of complete insensitivity to the Androgens”.
As her anthrogen receptors work wrong, Katie developed female signs.
She's got an office, but she's got no mothers and no eggs.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie is married to a child psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is childless, she hopes to be a parent by adoption or nursing a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own," Barac said.
He gives them time to do some analysis and discuss the situation, as well as the interval of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In that case, you are in order to raise a child, you love a child.
You have a wonderful baby, and you're happy.
We don't have to do an operation that won't work fast.
“This allows children to take part in the decision and remove the anxiety that will move parents because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
At the end of the day, the child will decide what sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is remarkable.
This allows children to make a decision on their own.
The "Chikago" thief Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to 40-year-old Russians, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two meetings, Habibulin first missed six teas from Tampa Bay, and then four from Otava, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth past tea.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I couldn't do that, CSNChicago says Habibulina.
- I need to find confidence in training, I'm sure it should be appropriate to play it, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You must study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite good.
But somehow, after a few heads, everything turns into a snowcracker.
Maybe I need to get some rest.
I don't think I'm the one who's always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not drunk.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my doors.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so much tea.
It's nice that my roommates support it, but in principle it's just that I have to play better.
Two games are not all season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.

In the Rubcovian region of the Baltic Sea, the PAH train was turned.
As a result, 13 TIRs were reported to the ICP regional administration, according to the data provided.
The former law enforcement authorities in the region reported 10 injured persons.
According to the agency, the accident took place about nine hours a day at the local time of the highway Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka, in 1 km from Novonikolaevki.
There were 12 passengers and drivers on the bus from Rubzovska, in Vienna, all suffered from various difficulties and were hospitalized.
Eleven wounded were delivered to the City Hospital No.1 of Rubcovsk, two persons being hospitalized in the Rubcovska CRB.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be placed in Europe
Russia expects that Superjet 100 aircraft will be placed on the market in Latin America and Asia, even in Europe.
"We count it to be more than 170 examples of such a type of aircraft in general that we will receive such agreements in general," says the Interfax, Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitria Medvedev, at a press conference with Prime Minister Jean Mark Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that close cooperation with French colleagues had been established because it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and in the Asian and Pacific region, it will also be assigned to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be put in France," the Russian Prime Minister stressed.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Suhogo Civil Aviation Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The linear is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality standards and comfort in the 100 passenger seats segment.

Such special exercises have long been out of place, so the true lovers of the electrotransmitter line table - overcrowded valves are based on practice, which makes the true home secure.
Grandfather Anja, a house in the village of Ivanovka Petríkova in the village of Ivanovka, has been living a real family for 20 years, and she has noticed that despite the efforts of her neighbors.
The birds put on new eggs, and the lower layer has already passed between the eggs and the eggs will move.
Of course, it is sad to see a family of donkeys that have been nestled in the backyards every year to pick up and train three or four birds in the summer, but it does not want to remain without light.
Just as birds flew to the warm end, Grandpa Anya called on the Carycanese RES, who belonged to the resistance.
She didn't even expect them to respond so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still being held, told the technical director of the Dneprobölergo Dnepropellerki by Sergei Berzevski.
In fact, corrosion had already begun in the nest of 150 to 200 pounds [200 kg].
At any moment, birds could be killed by an electric charge.
Yes, the local people were at risk of being left without light because of injury.
Therefore, linear mountings have begun a nest rescue operation, which is not the first time in our practice.
Scientists from the National University of Dnepropetrova assisted in the development of a genetic transfer scheme.
They have trained local network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenco, a known day-to-day propellant, advised energy at all stages of genetic reconstruction.
For the first time, more than 50 true "rooms" were considered to be in the emergency situation.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were used to remind the oven.
They were mainly fed with eggs, and then they carried the old nest there.
In the opinion of the experts, it is sufficient to place the old eggs as a basis for birds to learn the nest and return to it.
The same people will then be able to live their own lives.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Pescanka Novamosk.
A new railway station was set up with an electric current and placed on it a platform with an old nested nest.
All of the operations were combined with the energy of nine thousand slaves.
And today the same new village is located in the village of Ivanovka Petríkova, in the village of Anna's grandmother.
Here, the platform was built on the former site, just hanging over the halls.
Ornithologists are convinced that careful, conservative birds are not even aware that their "square" has been subjected to capital repairs.
Up to the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four other nests in the Pokrov and Carycan regions of Dnepropetrovina.
As long as some survive rare birds, others without regret kill them.
Every day, the whole area has been aired with the news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolo District, on the day of the opening of the pool hall, the bridesmaids have shot the lebedin family, promised to the local village.
The wild birds were not afraid of people. The locals were not afraid of them and were not afraid of them.
When the villagers heard of the shootings, they fled to the spring, and the fourth of the lesbians were already lying on the water dead.
The Police Department's staff are now finding out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is becoming more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be hosted by the "Russian March" Mary.
According to the "Lewad Centre" survey, the support of the "Russian March" is growing - 40 per cent of citizens agree differently on the idea of their conduct.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens agree to the "Russian March" conduct: 11 per cent of them are specifically positive and 29 per cent "faster".
The popularity of the Russian March ideas gradually grew - in 2006, only 14 per cent of Russians were welcomed, and in December 2010, there were already two more citizens (28 per cent).
"Determiningly negative" to "Russian March" is only 7% Russians, "faster negative" 19%.
35 per cent had not been able to shape their relationship with the action.
In this year, Moscow agreed to hold a Russian march of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, and today the head of the Department of Security of the capital, Alexei Majorov, has reported.
This act of nationalists takes place every year on the People's Day since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, “Did you hear that on 4 November Russian marches were held under Russian law? Three fourths (75 per cent) of citizens responded negatively.
Only five Russians (20 per cent) now know about this action.
It is noteworthy that, in December 2010, nearly three thirds of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard about the "Russian Marches".
We recall that three years ago, on 11 December, the Maneja Square had passed the physical migrating of the nationalists, which grew into mass unrest.
The Levada Centre also asked Russians about the celebration on 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who knew the correct answer (People's Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
In addition, only 15 per cent of citizens are gathered to observe this holiday.
About the same (17 per cent) were intended to postpone the October 7th revolution.
Most (62 per cent) citizens are not going to notice any of these holidays.
How Mary Moscow agreed to the Russian March in Lublin
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" in Lublin on 4 November.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Federation, the organizer of the Marcho Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to being held in Lublin on the Day of People's Unity, the Colovrat rock concert will also be held with the authorities.
As Russian March-2012
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, the Nationalists passed the sixth from the Yakaman complex to the Central Artist's House, where a rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to 20,000, and the MDGs called the number 6,000.
Communication: Obama's Premier headquarters considered the exception of Byden for Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest consultants of President Barak Obama had secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Byden with Hillary Clinton's candidate in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest sensation of all the expected books of Mark Galperin and John Hylemann on the 2012 "Stavki Double: The game changed 2012".
The Times had received a copy of the book ready to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the next Vice-Presidents had conducted “large-scale studies in focus groups and reviews of public opinion at the end of 2011” in order to assess whether the exclusion of Baden could help raise the growing hope of Obama's re-election.
According to the political spokesman The Times Jonathan Martina, the book provides a detailed description of the efforts of senior officers of the head of the head office and the White House, namely the former head of the administration of the White House of Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote on the appointment of former vice-president Clinton.
The possible replacement was a secret, closely protected at the Chicago Pre-Trial headquarters and at the Oval Cabinet.
Only six nearby presidential advisers, including Dale, former head of Obama Jim Messina headquarters and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Pluffa, knew what was going on.
The book "Stovkas doubled" claims that Dali was an initiative to replace Byden, despite their "near personal relationships", but eventually rejected this step when their data showed that Clinton's addition in the electoral list did not "budgetly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley, the Administration confirmed that it had indeed considered the possibility of replacing Byden Clinton.
“I have been actively talking about a lot of things, and this has been one of them,” said the Daily Journal.
You must remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, God, what are we doing?"
Although Dale described the study as “required verification”, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters had taken a lot to study whether this step would bring dividends to vote.
“The pre-election headquarters will not spend such amounts of money on surveys and focus groups unless they consider something whole,” said Martin in the AK 360 programme.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was investigating the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dali if he knew his immediate boss about the possible overcrowding.
Although Dali said he did not think that the President “bloat in course” was a possible replacement, the former head of administration acknowledged that Obama knew “probably”.
Martin added that the "Dublins" did not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political reconciliation had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously felt that Obama did not know about the possibility of removing Byden from the electoral list.
"Possible," answered Martin.
Do you want a candle in the darkness of the sea?
The British company created the first world light in the darkness by means of the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop a light food.
He came to this idea by reading a science article on medusas, and convinced scientists in China that the white light is chemically restored.
The mouse reacts with the tongue of the one who is it, increases the pH in the white and causes it to shine.
Chris says that since the ice starts to shine when it reacts to heat, it means that the more you lie, the more light it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company, says, "It's amazing, but it's still at the very initial stage, if it's about production, so you get about £200."
The protein that we use in the sea is in response to your language with a neutral pH.
So when your mouth gets white, it'll raise the pH and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it over the past few months, and it was said that it would be ideally presented to Halloween because it created such a remarkable effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminance of medicine is four times about gold.
So every shirt is worth about £140.
That's why it's nice to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cream, butter and taste of fresh gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It's impossible to determine because of the ice crystals caused by ice, which are frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do this.
The ice is used by the fluorescent properties of the media that are synthesised by Chinese scientists
Trainer "Avangarda" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of the preparation of his team to the game of the regular KHL champion against "Salvata", noted that the symptoms had been thoroughly analysed by the Magnetic Metallurga.
The Specialist stressed that Avangardu needed to pay greater attention to the game in defence.
We've seen a video of the match against the Magnitude of Metallurga - the official page of the word "Avangarda" in Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of tea, not a very pleasant moment.
They've gone through their mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew that the opponent had been executed.
According to their statistics, we were killed by five assaults by three teams.
It's a very good performance.
Were these errors taken into account when preparing for today's game?
We're talking to the kids every match, talking after the game, ready for the new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation should be implemented.
They all saw the first period of match against Metallurg.
The game was done, and the account was 2:0.
They left the cave "in the dining room" - and in the third period they started to lie.
In view of the gravity of the game, he did not see any sense of belonging to the defenders.
You have to defend the whole team.
Now, Avangarda has a long home series that goes through the day, and the team's got the stability?
All teams are in the same condition.
The main point is the realization of its moments and the performance of the game.
hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not that hard to deal with.
The new rules introduced by the Russian customs have already been in place for nearly a week on the Russian border.
Today, donor workers promised to provide drinking water drivers and set biofuels
In the border crossings, hundreds of furs were dug in Russia.
This situation has resulted in a change in customs regulations.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that Russia is often a party that has not previously warned of innovation.
Since 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have applied additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of East Customs, Vladimir Dennisov.
The new model document applies to countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The missed items are in strengthened mode.
The “Factow” correspondent came to the border and reported to the workers who had been in the situation.
The prices in the passenger coffee shop at the Novoazovsk pass point are increasing with each day as well as the fair line.
The gorillas stand in several rows, growing about two miles [2 km].
The Novoazovsk-Wesselo-Vaznesenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transportation routes from southern Ukraine to the international highway.
From here the goods are sent to the Stavropolsk region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Wednesday, before midnight, they were released, and then these rules were put in place, and Dr. Alexei Golovanov (in the photo), who is carrying a transistor through Russia's cargo from Turkey in Kazakhstan and is already in his car for nearly a week.
Under new rules to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and cargo insurance payments.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance they carry.
Minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 rubles (about 1100 to 1300 rubles).
Those who eat nearby (in Georgia, Armenia) with up to $50,000 worth of goods pay some 15 thousand rubles (3800 grits) and travel.
And the rest of them were shot, and none of them had any money!
Imagine if the driver is carrying a cargo of $4,000, but to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (about 23,000 rubles) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border are none of the workers who are equipped with the back of their cars.
In border stores and coffee and so on, but the prices like here we didn't meet anywhere!
The sellers ran out and quickly apologized: 15 of them stood for the boat, seven of them for a cup of coffee, 25 of them for a cup of soup.
And one cup of coffee.
And there's no toilet.
I'm sleeping in the stairs. I'm going to the toilet.
Don't lie, don't wake up...
I can't get out of the car for a week. I got a woman on my way.
A week later, another fighter, Victor Scotarenko, comforts himself.
Will you just come to my car next week?
Why do you have a liter of water?
It's 11 and 15 grits.
What, a bottle of crystal or water is still on the serebre?
We have coffee, not a store.
You're buying until there's something else, the salesman's money.
After the situation began to unfold in the media, the poor situation of Ukrainian leaders drew the attention of the regional authorities.
The leadership of the Ambrosian and Novosovojjjjjjjjjarsadminis, has been commissioned to ensure that all those who are moving along the Ukrainian-Russian drinking-water line, have declared the responsibility of the President of the Danish Ministry of Derognov's delegation.
At the missed points, Brigadier Brigades will be quick to help.
Biofuels will also be established for the benefit of people.
According to the official, the problem of regulation will be resolved in the coming days.
As reported by the press office of the Danish Dulgosard administration, 32 and 68 cars were deployed at international crossing points of "Sunkenka" and "Novoazovsk" on 31 October.
The Facts will follow the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to mislead the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to conduct information prosecutions against seniors of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries, such a statement was made by the BNS agency in the Department of the Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow, in particular, is going to “confirm” the President of Lithuania, Dalu Gribouscaite, and to publish falsified documents such as found in the Russian Gosarhi, which relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the Special Service, the Department of Information Attack is conducting an analysis of the public processes of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenko, who visited Lithuania and participated in the Lithuanian People's Party.
A staff member of the Department of Smirnov was also involved in the operation.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov had regularly visited Lithuania by the end of 2012 and had contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Simirnova has now been banned from entering the territory of the country.
President Gribouscayt stated that he knew about the information he was preparing for.
In her view, the main reason was the successful Presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the country ' s "Strengthening of energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader did not criticize the actions of the Russian authorities at the same time.
She thus stated that in Crimea to Lithuania there was “not enough respect”.
In addition, Gribouscay accused the head of the RF Vladimira Putin of “only one requirement” to Lithuania.
Remember, in September, Rosporebnadsor suspended the imports of Lithuanian molluscs into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product was not in conformity with the health and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that, if Russia did not withdraw the ban, the Government of the country should prepare treatment for the WTO.
In the United States, the school director shot young people.
The director of one of the American Secondary Schools of Youth literally led to disappointment.
A man, he said, had to take his weapon and start shooting.
An incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young hooligans broke into the man's home of the toilet library.
As a result, the school director opened up a youth shoot, resulting in several injuries to the foot and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
As the Hulligans were not in the property of the Director, he was accused of an attack under difficult circumstances.
Men were released from prison for $125,000.
However, the strike in the United States of America has become a terrible legality.
A man's literally threatened to fire at the center of the city of Rijskrest in California, U.S.A., right along the street.
After that, the criminal arrested two of the former prisoners, dragged them into the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Previously at the first school in Newton, Connecticut, there was an open shooting.
At school, Adam's mother worked, and she was a nurse.
U.S. school shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
A regular shooting incident took place on 31 January at the American school, at the same time in Atlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a pedagogist.

Halloween 2013
When I was a kid, Halloween was adorable.
My sister and I were allowed to have a conference, not to sleep late, and to put a mask on our area.
Now I'm more like an ass.
I haven't been able to distribute the envelopes in my neighborhood in the last two years, and most of all, I won't be able to do it this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white van with regard to Halloween.
According to the National Trade Federation, the majority of Americans — or 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend $6.9 billion on envelopes, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Trade Federation estimates that $1.2 billion will be spent on costumes of $6.9 billion.
This year, the fashion fashions have been sexually abused.
Women are no longer obliged to be sexual professionals; they may also be sexually gay, such as pikes, hamburgers or marquee.
As for the men, I think we will see a lot of zombies thanks to the "Leaders of the Dead," and I am sure that the cosmonauts in the Daft Punk group will fall into our Instagram sheets this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are most often sought are zombies, Betman, pirates, and tapes.
Please, there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We've had our dogs in the past year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Different Trade, the United States will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When the case comes to the conference, we don't worry.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds concert, Twizzlers and Clark Bar batons.
According to the US Ministry of Commerce, these are excellent news for 41 million children who have been willing to obey our regions.
Moreover, we will buy and not deceive ourselves — we will spend 90 million pounds of chocolate in the time of Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is the confectionery in the form of cornseeds; however, according to the National Coding Association, nearly 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual cucurbits.
It's a reminder that I still have to think about.
Nothing makes Halloween sound like a house with dreams.
They have boring names, such as "The Walls of the Walls" (which are in this prison), "Wow and Crick" and "Dot shock".
Moreover, according to the American Haunts society, there are 1200 officially recognized homes with dreams that generate about $500 million income, as well as those boring photographs that you have almost described that your friend has posted on Facebook, and you can't pick up, and then the guy you like will see this photo and leave a comment on the kind of "class expression of person".
And finally, we're talking about teasing.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Lake when we were children, and the drawing of Jack’s lamp was like the beauty of a birthday tree, what we did with the children.
Fortunately for us, the fashion of a child in a cage started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew out of these tires and not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. census office, this year the United States spends about $106 million on tobacco.
The lighthouse Jack, who slowly jumped on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which had grown to 542 million pounds this year.
If you want to do more work, report Tim and Susan Metisdon to the city of Napa, California, and try to figure out one of their tea bags at 2032 pounds.
The Minoboron website of Estonia was restored after the attacks of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia's website was restored after the morning cyberattack, reports the press office.
According to the Deputy Chancellor of Minoboron on Information and Administrative Questions, it was a primitive attack, and the site just overloaded a large number of requests.
Our specialists have quickly reconfigured everything, the site's work has been restored to this time.
"The Ministry's damage is minimal," said Petercop in Postimees.
According to Petercopa, it's early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We are obliged to examine the causes of the incident and make our conclusions on it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents,” he acknowledged.
On 1 November, Anonymous Ukraine launched a network of approaches to confirm the hacker attack on the website of Minoboron Estonia and protested against the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We don't have to be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia, either.
Ukraine should not be a slave.
We speak for the independent Ukraine.
"Hands other than Ukraine," said Anonymous.
The former Minoboron of Ukraine reported that the mouth of the Pacific Ocean Battalion would take part in NATO’s command-building lessons by Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Because of the existence of the unclean force, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's province of Southern Matabeleland were closed because of the attack on the students... the Goblin.
As the local elder said, the children were panicked, and it was impossible to continue.
The Goblin story may sound like a child's idea for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In Zimbabwe, for example, the hospital was closed in summer because the paramedics were also attacked by Goblin.

Inside are railway seats and six-point security belts, as well as the internal communications system.
In addition, modernized brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works machines, logistical support and maintenance of a car between activities can be obtained.
Dr. Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The advertising participants in Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced runners, but people seeking wool, clothing and access to the world class.
We are pleased to propose this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different RAL disciplines in Britain and beyond, as well as to prepare participants to the difficult conditions and realities of RV.
We were very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge car — a truly exciting champion.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in field activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces are unaware of the "Brade Circle" group - New News
INTERFAX.RU is a reference to an information source in the law enforcement authorities of the RF.
"After reports of the Ministry of Finance of the United States of Welles were received in the media on the inspection lists of suspects belonging to the Eurojust Crime Syndicate, we reviewed all the databases, but the groups did not find out," the agency's associate said.
In his view, the dissemination of this information has contributed to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which is currently operating abroad.
As noted earlier, the US Ministry of Finance has published a list of alleged members of the “British Round” criminal group on its website yesterday.
Among them was also the Russian poet Grigory Leps.
He's on the list as "Grish", and he's on the threat list.
They match the data of the popular Russian executive.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevride, the creative pseudonym, the place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, Israeli citizens, Uzbekistann citizens and another ex-SCR outlaws, whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, it is believed that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for members of the band according to their order.
The message is attached to the photo of the singer and all of its data that are relevant to the reality are indicated.
In addition, Leeps had recently bought a home in Phukette.
The Bureau noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of the American Minfin would lead to the blocking of its assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with those living in the United States.
Assistant Lépsa Maya Sericova said that no announcements had been made: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Gregory who is now talking about a scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is media information.
He had no personal reports, although I do not know whether they were in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, amazing and unexpected," she said RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps doesn't live on Phuket, but, as Minfin says, he actually has a home on the Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long trip to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news stopped him during his flight to the city of Blogještensk.
A fugitive on the field in the Shinnik matte.
There were some details of the identity of the fan who escaped in the field during the match 1/16 of Cuba Russia's finals between the Russian "Shinnik" and the Moscow "Spartacus".
According to the head of the CDC RFS, Arthur Grigorjanc, referring to the MDG data, this patient is a Muslim.
He's been detained right now.
"In the light of this, the Grigoriant told about how Fantasy was able to get into the field: "It was clear that the data, called his viewer, had come to the immediate attention of two viewers, referring to the problems with the heart.
He came to help quickly. He confirmed the doctor immediately.
Then he turned away from the two companions and fled into the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South Front to the corner of the East and North.
He ran through all fields.
That's what the Stuarts are responsible for.
Before entering into force of the law on sport, this area of conduct of the stadiums - the police cannot interfere with what is in the field.
He got to the tribunal, passing through the Eastern tribunal.
And at that time there was a misunderstanding on the East Tribunal and on the roads," the head of the CDC said.
We recall that the Moscow Spartacus decision would take place without witnesses the upcoming 15th round of the Russian campaign against Locomoty and Zenita, and would pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire squads were called for the rescue of the wounded prisoner, who shot 50 feet above the ground at dangerous entry into the career
Cocker Sparrow Ruby escaped after she fell into the small TTP.
Three days later, she noticed a man playing a dog.
Fires fell on the back of the fence to save the dog from the impending death
It was a pleasure to escape after the fire squads had been called to lift him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow shot 50 feet at the dangerous entrance of the trailer.
Ruby's nine-month cooker escaped after she fell into a car accident on Wednesday, and spent three days in solitary confinement before she was rescued from a career in the middle.
Her husband, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were in the Fleppit career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to join Ruby, and were grateful for the fire-saving service in West Yorkshire.
They sought their missing dog and placed treatment on social networks after she ran into a career after a minor accident.
For example, at 14:15 in the middle of the starbird, Rubi noticed a 50-foot stop at the entrance of the career.
The technical rescue team from Clekchiton's fire station rushed down to the scene, dropped down on the logs to save Ruby, and used the transfer to lift her up onto the roof.
An officer of the rescue team, Andy Clayton, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.”
It was right on the middle of the wooden floor — 50 feet up to the top and down to the ground.
She didn't move the muscle during the rescue, she was completely lost.
But now she's fine.
Then she's got a paycheck.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog has noticed is incredible.
An officer of the rescue team, Peter Lau, said, "Robby was very proud that she was saved."
It was likely that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were taken to the veterinarian for examination, and it was established that everything was in order, except fuel and cargo.
Ms. Hall of Galifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Looking at rescue was terrible."
I couldn't believe she was there.
It was scary when she happened to be in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she was pregnant and lost consciousness, she would almost fall.
The fires were huge.
It was very brave — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each one of them has been absolutely boring.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mike Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she was a Czech-vocalist for the 2004 Jaguar song of Old Habits die hard.
Perry said she was dating a sailor, and she said, "He played with me when I was 18. "
She added: “It was a very long time, and he was very good.”
In a fourth statement, the representative of seventy-year-old Jagger said that he “categorizedly denied that he had ever been bullied by Katie Perry”.
The representative said, "Maybe it will lead him to someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests in the Rolling Stones tournament this year.
Her new Prism album was debuting for the first time this week.
George Crevan: Breaking with Europe gives Scottish voters a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the European free movement zone as a condition for membership in the EU.
It is based on history of passport control in Bervik and the border with a train crossing along the Adriatic coast.
True, Strathclyde’s paper pointed to the possible economic benefits of the more free movement of the rest of Europe, although it is not expected to be in the headlines.
No one has also indicated that EU Member States are spending a lot of time in order to improve their formal rules in such a way as to be acceptable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance with the requirements will be a cause for concern for Brussels rather than what it actually wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's not worth the attention of history.
And so old that she turned into a kimmeleon: for the first time, I heard a “stupid” saying that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting moment that has been lost in the transfer of the old story.
Why should the whole independent of Scotland comply with Europe's demands?
Why would London's brand change in Brussels's brand, especially now?
Here are the European news: the great plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With Eurocrisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties speaking against the EU or rejecting the euro as a single currency shall take effect.
Even in Germany, the "Alternative for Germany" party, which was based only this year, has come from nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus putting the press on the "Free Democrats" (as opposed to our "Liberal Democrats") from Budapest.
There has always been internal opposition to the Federal Europe's establishment plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The harsh economic measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shoulder imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency have led many to the view that Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis was a little linked to the fact that national governments were working at excessive budget deficits, which was just for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members in exchange courses for German exporters — German policies and wishes to remain.
As far as national currency is concerned, South Europe is not ineffective in its previous production capacity compared with Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut payments and government costs, which are actively supported by Berlin.
The issue of the current budget and currency is a deeper issue for Europe's production capabilities.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a figure that means subsidizing French and German energy companies through the consumer, the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times for gas than in the United States.
It's paralleling the adverse price conditions we've seen in the Greensmouth.
No pollution of wages in the world will stop the devastating victory of the US-wide solar gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, there was a rebellion, especially in France, at times the biggest EU side.
After the war, the French political elite looked at the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs political legitimacy in Paris, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s economy in a desperate state.
The result is the right of the Marin Le Pen National Front to the EU party only to win decisive additional elections by putting the ruling party of the Socialists in third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent votes — a timely warning to British Liberians that it cannot be ruled out by the assumption that the right gap is automatically said for the benefit of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If, and most likely, the EU party will be supported by these elections, this block will be able to take the dominant position of the European Parliament first.
Here is my view: rapidly growing attitudes towards the EU and the single currency in Europe are being united in order to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become some kind of "European (Sovereign) Nations", which has liked the General de Goll.
Germany and some of its economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currency.
I imagine that Britain is away from this project, hoping to draw closer to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific points to the likelihood that Britain will remain without attention to the Atlantic cold.
What kind of situation is it leaving Scotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides, sending Berlin and Brussels to the streets.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to achieve a more free European agreement on the condition that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other unilateral countries will be easier for nations in the Netherlands.
On the contrary, we should consider the possibility of restoring Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, as it were, the most successful political movement in Europe against the harsh economic measures that the majority of votes received in 2011 owing to objections to the reduction of the costs proposed (and realized) by the Liberian Chancellor of the character of Alister Darling and the subsequent coalition of tower and liberal democracies.
It would now be inappropriate for Scotland to vote for independence only in order to take action against the harsh economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sex: Early Age
African and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white parents are doing research.
Physical changes do not mean that sex is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe that the ovarian epidemic may be one of the early sexual orientation mechanisms
The trend toward early sex is not so expressed in boys
Former correspondent for CNN Pet Etridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family matters.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter is beginning to develop breast cancer and breast - feeding at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orland, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are sufficiently widespread among American girls and are a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time with calming parents, which usually does not mean fast sexual maturity,” said Kaplovitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast, lip, and subcutaneous hair and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a small amount of manarche (first ministership) in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and was reduced from 12.75 in 1970.
“After breast development, at least two or three years to manarche,” said Kaplovitz, also author of the book “Further sex in girls: how to deal with this widespread problem”.
Time is the most precise test of how sex will progress.
There is a discussion of what constitutes the actual occurrence of sexual maturity, but it is considered “precious” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years of age.
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stopped — that is, the pediatric can be closely monitored.
Faster progress may be a basis for analysis in enchorinology to eliminate serious problems such as hearing or oxygen.
There are procedures to stop early mining and prevent further effects: premature aging of bones, which may eventually lead to slowing growth and underage growth.
Recommendations on medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The caplovitator is careful with drugs, but acknowledges that “sex addiction can alleviate behavioural problems and the feeling of girls being different from peers”.
Another major problem is that parents simply don't want their young daughters to have a menstrual period.
“They are concerned about the risks of pregnancy or even about how they deal with hygiene,” said Kaplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter began to abuse at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about ministership, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and frustrated because she was the first of her friends.
There are many disseminating theories on the causes of early sex.
However, there is no consistent evidence that lead hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys — and girls — have sex before.
The caplovitator claims that the premise that has the greatest weight is the ovarian epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which linked the number of births in the sex organization.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributors.
In that country, African and Latin American girls usually reach sex earlier than their white girls.
There are various explanations.
Throughout the world, early sex creation, of course, affects everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another warning: Although boys have hair on their face and feet at younger ages, the trend toward full early sex is not as clear as that of a girl.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of hair and hair is seen even among young people and children of age.
“We need to be careful about how we define the real occurrence of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Laurence Silverman, a child psychologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive guidance from the pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean earlier than expected,” Caplovitz explained.
If you keep calm, your child usually reacts well.
Girls who grow up early need to confirm that even when this happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
U.S. Boeing is on his way out.
The open-air observers flying over the territory of Russia and flying in the middle of an unplanned landing in Chitay U.S. aircraft on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m. in Moscow.
The airport’s management allowed the ship to board and received fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the airport will be located in Ulan Udde.
According to other data, he will be sent to the United States.
As reported, the Ulan-Udé aircraft landed in the Zabakal region because of a tsunami.
He was not released from China Airport because of unpaid accounts.
There are 30 persons on board, including a crew, who spent two nights on the airport, reports ITARS.
As reported in the MID RF, under the terms of the open-air Treaty, people on board the aircraft have no right to proceed beyond the airport of Reada, they can only cross border control in two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulan-Udde.
The Treaty on the Open Sky was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating in it.
Observer flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are transparency, monitoring of arms control agreements, enhancing the ability to prevent crises and resolve crises within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much the rest of the signatories work - the IC in the United States of America
The highest income rating in 2013 was headed by Madonna, which earned $125 million.
However, her late husband, Michael Jackson, whose deaths from October 2012 to October 2013, amounted to 160 million.
It is noteworthy that other survivors of the life of the phenomenon, who have "worked" several times in the past year, are staying away from it.
The second of the most “sound” names in the list, produced by Forbes, was Elvis Presley, 55 million per year, and the comic book Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million) came in the first five.
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow, the first bottle of Igoria Gulaeva opened
On 23 October, the opening of the first Flagman bottle of Igorya Golayeva was held in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulaev is well known for his great products from the soft luxury class.
And now they can appreciate even more fashion worshipers - in Moscow, his first bottle was finally opened, so the designer and the dinner was set up in a dolce vita style.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls in Russia live.
That's why I'm especially happy that I've opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where I'm actually part of it.
That's what Igor said. He threw a beautiful tape and invited all those who wanted to... imitate the models he saw!
Manufacturers of reactive aircraft are impressed by the width of the seat, when large orders are made on horses
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a serious dispute over the spread of the travel class seats on further voyages, giving a tone for a serious confrontation at the Dubai aviation exhibition this month.
The platform will focus on the wide range of seats provided for the long-term economic-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the attention of the airlines, while the extent of space assigned to them plays a key role in the approval of the effectiveness of the latest aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus called for the introduction of a industry standard, which would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economic class halls, but her major American competitor Boeing said that this should be decided by the airline.
The delay will take place when aircraft manufacturers have increased their larger versions of their two-wheeled multi-engine aircraft and potential recording orders are expected to be issued on 17-21 November.
The composition of the rear part of the aircraft — especially if 9 or 10 persons are in a row — is central to the economic efficiency of the new “mini-aircraft” projects.
Boeing claims that her updated 777X will include 406 persons, based on seats in an economic class of more than 17 holes in the width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that its competing version A350 would transport 350 people to the economic class at the seats of an 18-piece round.
Aeroplanes are often replaced by technical attacks by advertising in professional press.
And now Airbus is heading directly to the public before a plane in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what might be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing the slide financiers depicting three people in the restaurant who were attracted to each other by the name “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing proposes further major flights to the seats of more narrow than regional turbulence aircraft,” said Airbus John Lihi, sales manager.
By changing food rations, people pick a bag, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 had standardized modern travel, and the average American male ratio increased by 10 per cent from 40 to 49 years, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American male density of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the United States Health Statistics Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor maintains the concept of the 1950s seats, when the medium size of those recently referred to as “reactive publication”.
Airbus said that a study had ordered that an additional drop in the seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing argues the Airbus figures on the size of the seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in deciding how airlines find a balance between tariffs and preferences.
According to her, studies show that salon's convenience depends not only on the width of the seat.
“In fact, the choice of airlines and the opportunity to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said expert Boeing on Kent Creaver’s Salons.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them benefits.
They know their actions better than anyone else.
The issue for passengers is to increase side space, but for suppliers it is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
The dispute is based on orders for aircraft estimated at least $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decade — enough to change the relationship between American and European exports.
As reported earlier in July by the Reuters agency, the presence of seats is the result of a conflict between new reactive aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim 20 per cent increase in profits at one place in their latest two-wheel long-distance models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365 Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared characteristics of Boeing are partly based on the comparison of 10 local rows 777X with the original 9 local composition of the construction series 777.
The individual self-esteem will be reduced compared to the 10 local component currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to force more places and make his aircraft more competitive than our development,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that halls full of 10 local rows for existing 777 indicate that many passengers prefer a flat roof that can be hand-handed with lower rates.
“The presence of the eight-year-olds would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal has been commercially threatened by the 777 model,” said salon expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide a chair, but they offer a folder of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
Travellers who travel around the world are even driving their wheels to check competitive planning.
In the light of the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very flat-rolled salon for budgeted airlines and regional flights.
Airbus suggests A350 with 10 local lines, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
In recent times Airbus stressed the need for further changes in salon, offering more space to pass on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of another manufacturer of large modern aircraft, as experts say, its call for a new industry standard is almost “extended” but may draw attention to the volume of sales of model 777X.
A new anti-inhibiting vaccine may cause the smoking process to lose its satisfaction
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could lead to a loss of satisfaction in the cigarette smoking process.
One dose of vaccines has been able to protect dogs from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
There is a need for further testing before people are tested, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the New York Medical College, Will Cornell, said that the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to fire, tested all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern resources,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies.
The virus is selectively infecting cells of bees that then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies are absorbed by any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralising them before they reach the brain, preventing the use of nicotine.
In the tests, the infected mice, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that did not give the vaccine “are weakened”, and this is a sign that nicotine has reached their brains.
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, schools had to do so so many times that they were expensive and not practical.
But the value of the new vaccine will probably be much lower because it turns the cells into the antithelial factory.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccines were to be completely safe, it could be given to children before they would want to try a cigarette that would prevent nicotine dependence.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to burn smoke.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get it because of nicotine, and that can help them get out of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned that additional research was needed.
Oolianas: Third rural settlements in the South Pacific are entirely adjacent
Deputy Governor of the Podmoskoj Yuri Olynikov stated that almost three thirds of the rural areas of Moscow are entirely adjacent
The total budget of the region receives 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 residents from 288 received allocations from the regional budget.
The share of appropriations in the 122 rural budget is over 50 per cent, and 83 per cent are appropriations.
As part of the budgetary security budget, some 25 billion rubles are delivered," Olyenikov said.
The Deputy Governor also noted that in only three urban settlements - Mitišt, Onezovo and Pushkino - budget revenue is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of many rural areas is less than 3 million rubles, "that's not enough."
The cost of the local administrative equipment in the 88 submosques is over 70 per cent, “but the quality of services is under surveillance”, Olyenic noted.
Earlier, he had instructed the heads of municipal education in the South Pacific to consider, by the end of November, what settlements needed to be expanded, integrated into the urban area or change of the administration system.
These proposals will be launched by the end of January.
The governor of the region of Moscow stated that under the administrative reform in the Netherlands, it is planned to reduce the number of rural settlements.
Also in the Mojay, Casher, Sunni, Colmensian, Lubers and Cotténic regions there is a request for the establishment of municipalities.
This issue will be discussed in the cities and regions of the region in November.
President Moszldom Igor Brençalov also stated that the entire integration of the coming amreform is planned for about 30 rural settlements in the 12 sub-Saharan region.
This is linked to the fact that less than three thirds of 178 rural settlements in the Netherlands have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 are additional.
Diana Arbenina has abandoned Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great satisfaction she receives from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Argentina is now spending too much time on creative and public activities, it still has the opportunity to travel with Marto and Artem, not only to spend time in their training but also to enjoy it as much as possible.
In the last week, Diana twice reported to her fellow worshipers about her educational talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she is learning to read to children.
And last night, she was dancing fans, showing how she got Artema and Marto to Hellowin.
Our first halloween" was called Diana's photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
It is unwise, for they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday because they were born in America.
First Germany introduces "undefined sex" in Europe when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate “undefined” in the registration of children born of haemaphrodite instead of male or female sex.
The child’s parents will have the right to leave the sex graph in evidence of an incomplete birth.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male gender) parents may write "H" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at preventing parents from interrupting the sex-distorting operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns born in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeda
Former Minister of Labour of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the investigator of the State's anti-corruption supervisory body.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, monitors changes in the lease of primorial objects at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeda, who was secretly owned by the three Statehood units.
The Independent Counter-Corruption Commission (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday whether Mr. Obeid had authorized several ministers of the state to extend the lease agreement to Cerkular Ki, where the family of Obeidud belonged to two restaurants and coffee, without a tendering period after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeida ' s secret involvement in the non-movable facilities, after showing that Mr. Tripodi Lin Espoul was the former Deputy Head of Administration on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be presented at an open competition.
The contractors were opposed to this, as well as wanted longer terms of the lease.
In 2009, the leases of enterprises to Cerkülar Ki, which brought the family to Obeids about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially spoke for open competition.
He refused, however, that the amendments had been made at the request of Mr. Obida, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged him to make changes to the Government's lease policy.
The IAC's signature of the telephone talks led to talks in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dann, the senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeed in the fisheries department.
“Was there a question discussed during these telephone talks on the development of commercial lease policy?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willi Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi. —
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to the senior officer, Israeli military aircraft attacked the targets inside Syria
The senior administrative officer in Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft attacked the Syrian port of Latvia on Thursday evening.
The officer did not explain that it was intended, but said that at least one.
“Associated Press” reports that the objective of the Russian production was SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried cargo aircraft with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign sub-class 457 visas may be tested for “study”
The “diversity” test for foreign workers under Class 457 visas is being considered by the Government, as it aims to increase repression measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied in accordance with the criteria for preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified posts or as a licensee for moving family and friends to Australia.
A document submitted by the Government to the discussion was published today, while former Liberian MP Maxine McKyu criticized the Government ' s rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying that it could be tried by the neighbours of Australia.
“The grave statements of the "foreigners, at the end of the year" and "the beginning of the work of Australians" are a very unpleasant outcome to the time when trade unions called for a protected labour market," she said to Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was a white job to protect — and I would not be surprised if some in the region saw the signs of this historic artifact.
The document presented in the discussion outlined 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on the subject of human trafficking, had already made five of the recommended changes, while the others were in the course of consideration.
If the criteria of “relevantness” are accepted, the applicant may be able to study whether “the candidate is valid under circumstances where the candidate is a relative or a close relative of the owner or person with regard to the financing of the undertaking”.
Companies may also need to account for the number of visa holders in the 457 sub-class, since earlier companies aimed at sponsoring a small number of workers were then taken into office.
In the meantime, 35-year-old skirmish seeking refuge is expected to die from the infraction after arriving on a boat with refugees on the island of Genesis this week.
The victim's nine-year-old son was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death, he has been supported by a twin brother who has also been on board the ship.
The Australian authorities quickly sent a man to the Birth Island hospital where he died.
The other seed of Varlamova said that hockeys suffer from alcoholism
Another hockeyist, Semena Varlamov Evgenie Varinuk, said that it suffered from alcoholism, transmitted to the Russian news service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," she said, in particular, a woman.
We recall that Wavrinuk was brought to trial for the murder of a Russian collector, Semen Varlamov, who was also a member of the Colorado Club.
In her words, a hockeyist beat her hair and killed her after an attack by her hands, breasts, life and shame.
Varlamov himself came to the D.A. and confessed to the murder, describing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released at $5,000.
The court did not have to restrict sportsmen from moving abroad, but prevented them from approaching Vavrinuk.
He is also under threat of imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The Government of Great Britain announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact of Scotland on the HS2 railway master project.
The HS2 project is intended to open high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
Minister for Transport of Baronness Kramer noted that the project “united Britain”.
Minister of Transport of Scotland Kit Brown said that he was “in the spring” from the perspective of work on a plan with the Government of Great Britain.
The first stage will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Step is completed, the lines will be drawn up in Manchester and Lids.
In June the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The Government of Great Britain, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the passing capacity of the railway and the reduction of travel duration for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London within three hours or less.
Baronness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a current national network that makes Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a crisis of passability in our railway network.
But it is also about the transport of cities with one another; 18 cities throughout Britain, including Glazgo and Edinburgh, will receive a better message through HS2.
Scotland's secretary, Alister Carmicle, added: “Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Government of Scotland, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmicla to support the integration of Scotland into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has all the opportunities to bring great economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic burden of Scotland to the general argument on the high-speed railway throughout Britain.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the Government of Great Britain to consider the options for the construction of high-speed railways in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glazgo-Edinburg railway line, which is already planned by the Government of Scotland.
I look forward to examining the results of the studies with the British Ministers next year and the joint decision on the following steps.
Toriy is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Hydrogen burning (where it is available) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
The atomic energya deals with nothing else but leaves behind a mass of roads in the disposal of waste.
Recently, scientists have focused on the Towers as another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is a global meeting, and as experts say, its destruction does not leave wastes that have to be preserved for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia until they are in force
Travellers of Australian airlines will need to keep off their plans and smartphones during landing and landing, despite the United States measures to freeze the rules on the devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch video or play on their devices during flight and landing, provided they remain in the flight schedule.
Travellers can do this during the main part of the flight, but many feel that they have no access to their e-books at the time of departure and landing.
Australian carriers consider this decision, which requires American airlines to carry out huge amounts of work in accordance with new requirements, but have indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“The Administration of Civil Aviation Safety does not currently have special rules governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft”, he said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times and by passengers to comply with the safety rules notified to them by crew members.
The company Virginia, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to changes, but stated that it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
“We would welcome the Office of Civil Aviation Security to consider the issue of allowing electronic devices to be used, since we really think that it will improve the quality of customer service now when it (the unmanned entertainment system) is on our planes,” the press secretary said.
Kandas stated that the rules would be maintained at this time.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during flight and landing, and we are not planning to change them in the near future,” she said.
The FAO Decision is distributed to the American airline.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in the regular changes that could benefit passengers, and we will, of course, carefully examine the FAU decision and the reasons for it.
For the United States carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from the airline to the airline and will depend on the age of their airport.
Transporters will have to prove that their aircraft is able to maintain radio-trailers from mobile devices, as well as to review the benefits, training materials, manuals and passenger instructions.
“After the airline will check and confirm its fleet’s amplitude, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic equipment such as planes, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAU said.
In rare cases, bad visibility of the crew will give passengers instructions to disable their devices during landing.
Furthermore, according to the Panel's recommendation, more heavy equipment should be installed under seats or in upper bulkheads at the time of landing and landing.
Heads of Dagestan are heard in the drum of Cuban notes of extremism
The football match between Angie and Cuba was chosen in a political coalition between the authorities of Krasnodar and Dagestan after the patients broke the Dagestan flag, and the Cuban game called for a different call.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited the Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court, because the game of the Krasnodar end of Cuba was called for an international difference, in particular the war against the Basurmans.
Take the Christmas tree, which was adopted in 1995 in our time.
It's the same thing, and no one's gonna do it.
"Remembering you here as the mother of a family, the enemy, we are going to a death fight on bourne" - why such words are recorded in the gym, torture one of the believers to the other," he expressed solidarity with Abdulatipian President of Parliament Hizri Shissaid.
Putin found no punishment for his friend Asad
And now, news from the ocean, that is, from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has been attacked by the rockets of Russian production, which, according to reports, were intended to be "Hezbollah".
Today, Syria has met an important requirement to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached by Russia and the United States that allowed the military operation to be carried out that summer.
More details on weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will be told by our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington said that the Assad regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 peaceful inhabitants, including hundreds of children, were killed in August of the exhaust gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombers, but in the kind of deal that another Asad-Vladimir Putin had set up.
Syria withdrew from its chemical weapons until the middle of the following year.
And today is an important occasion.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had withdrawn from the construction of declared chemical production factories.
The longer and heavy task is the destruction of the tons of chemical weapons and components.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Previously on Washington, he said that Assad's days are over.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether this happens, but when it happens.
He's not legitimate anymore, and he should go.
But Assad remains.
And he feels more confident.
His troops are still using artillery, rockets and rifles.
His opponents are reported and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to ask for letters and cards.
Many believe that Basar Assad has avoided the punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement calls for the success of diplomacy, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to inspectors, and Assad himself was impressed by the human cooperation.
Today, the US Ambassador to Syria in Washington has had to answer simple questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is much easier than he was killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is still there.
And he's changing weapons to power.
The President of the RFF established a separate Ministry of Construction and the HCK
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, established a new Ministry of Construction and the HCCP and proposed that his ex-government in the Ivano region lead Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met Michael Menem in his residence in New York, and I did not refuse to take the lead in the new department.
The Press Secretary of President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all functions relating to construction and HKH are being transferred to the new Ministry of Minrego.
Michael Mene - son of a well - known Orthodox priest of Alexander Mena, finished the Moscow Institute of Petroleum named Gobkina.
Since 1995, his political career - he had been elected in the Moscow area from the Sergei-Posada region, was a member of the State Duma, the first vice-president of the Government of the Moscow area, the vice-president of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michel Mene was governor of the Ivano region.
Lombar owners in Singapore are doing a good job while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
At the Lambbarde, Bendemir Trade Center in Singapore, Janani Amirhaling has a gold necklace, a knife and a chain to pay for her daughter's school education.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put there,” said Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although she also works S$3,000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the question in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is growing, is that the ValueMax, where it is engaged, became the third Lombardo registered at the Singapore Foundation.
The loan under the loan for the Jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthhaling), but almost as expensive as the unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, lombars usually account for an effective annual rate of 17 per cent — almost 15,4 per cent proposed by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with the branch in the same trading centre.
However, the Lombars have the advantage that they do not require verification of the credit capacity or evidence of the payment and may grant loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people throughout the region are being forced into labor camps, as families feel pressure because of increasing the cost of life and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis, and low-income loans that have been subject to free monetary and credit policies in developing countries, families with low and medium-income income are sought into the lobby to compensate for the slowdown in their economy.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency indicated that the increase in the family credit sheet was mainly due to the growth of mortgages as a risk factor for Asian banks' credit capacity.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest domestic debt ratio in Asia.
Malaysia headed the list from 80 per cent of GDP to 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from the technical recession.
The fourth data showed the continued decline in exports and the decrease in consumer demand.
“The fact that people will be able to complete their income wherever they can, with an increased price of people in the middle and lower part of [income scale], is that they will find ways to complete their income wherever they can,” says Song Sing Wong, economicist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
Recorded high prices for gold in the last two years have made it possible for people to invest their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to earn money for their family savings.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the materials stored in 200 city boroughs are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold is good. Let us borrow a cup of gold from our grandmother and let us get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest shipyard operator in EasyMoney saw the growth of clients using his office in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
The growth in the lobby business such as that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemire and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Jehu Lee Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an increase of 60 per cent from S$66 million this week by placing shares in Singapore's fund exchange.
While some creditors raised fires of criticism due to high rates, Ms. Jehuh said that Lombard did not only offer lower rates than other creditors, nor did it increase the debt directly.
“Clients are setting up items that they already have, and personal assets do not increase the debt of households,” she says.
The facility is making greater public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term funding.
The lobbyers are not the only categories of people in a difficult financial situation.
The wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, with gold rings or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase price.
We see clients from all areas of society.
“They include decent persons who need to spend short-term money on commercial projects or investments, or small-scale businesses who need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” said Ms. Jehu.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
Today, the number and status of available medical institutions is not important to the population, but the quality of medical assistance.
The implementation of the programme “Modernization of the Health of the Tullian Area 2011-2013”, the reorganization of our city's health institutions will provide an optimal structure for the provision of public health assistance, including gynecologically ill, pregnant and breast-feeding.
Thus, after association with the miner, there was an even greater chance of attracting narrow specialists from the GHG " NHKB" to consult patients with different pathology, to conduct additional hospital-based studies.
During the implementation of the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment has been developed in line with world standards.
In those years, about 8 million rubles were allocated to the capital repair of premises, and 112 units of equipment were acquired for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment has an intense post for newborns.
The Sel-Sever device is used to collect blood from the operational wound and after special treatment, to restore it to its offspring by avoiding the transfer of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical laboratory diagnostic office.
In women ' s consultations, the electronic register is in place, and the introduction of the electronic maps and patient's history of the patient's illness is planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, newborns and newborns with regional specialists.
The Chechens killed and stole 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The Chechnys were arrested by the French police for suspects in a series of attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation took place in March of the current year.
About 60 women were in mourning for the actions of the cassettes.
It is reported that the gangs ordered prostitution in one of the Strasbourg hotels and then killed and captured them.
The head of the band was 27 years old before Chechny's former judge.
David Alaba was the best Austrian sports champion in 2013, reporting the official Bundesli website.
In this dispute, he has appointed representatives of winter sports that are traditionally becoming the best in the country.
Second, Colonel Marcel Hirsher took over, and the third was a ski lift with Gregor Schlerenzauer's tram.
In the last 21st century, the Austrian Philippines-Nigerian origins helped their team win in the League of Championships, Championships and Kubke Germany, as well as in the UEFA Supercubake.
Former wife Archavine breathes with actor Andrey Chad
An ex-citizen woman of the Pieter "Zenata " Andreya Archavin Julia Baranovskaya is taking a break with actor Andrey Chad.
Julia breathes in Italy in an actress company Anastasia Zavisa, her wife, the figure of Sergey Slavnova, and actress Andreya Chadov.
The photos of the joint swallows were published in the Instagram Anastasia Road.
It's not the first joint photograph of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, the Traveller published a photo on which a couple had to stand on the banks of the Finnish River in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the Zenita Havbek, Andrey Archavin, admitted that he lived separate from his civil wife July.
Remember, Julia Baranowski and Andrey Archavin had three children since 2003.
It has recently been known that Archavin is meeting with ex-Model Alice Kazmin.
A new partner, Archavine, was married to the core manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasman health
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for the weak health system of Tasmania will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the Government will not lose the means of delivery.
The Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Society is taking “serious measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the higher level of chronic diseases and limitations of the system.
The financing decision was taken for four years after the Government consulted with the independent delegation of Tasmani Andrew Wilki.
“The Government has proposed a package of exceptional rescue measures, which we believe will address specific problems facing the state,” said Ms. Plibersek today.
The package sized $325 million includes $31 million in the planning company.
2600 further operations, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the delay.
There is also money for hospitals receiving patients without prior registration in Hobarte and London to improve after-site care, medical training, mental health services and the introduction of personal health cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will bring to the best of doctors the idea of how to better help the Tasman health system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to support the existing funding levels in order to obtain the Society's funds and to take into account each month where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and effective as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not be resolved unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put Tasman's health system on a more sustainable basis.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to its urgent request for assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the completion of the health system of this state from the critical state,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the Government of the State, these additional electoral procedures significantly compensate for recent reductions.
However, the Federal Opposition Representative for Health Peter Datton believes that today's statement is “a solution similar to that of a doctor”.
“The reason we are here is that the Liberian Government has dropped $430 million from the health system,” he said on ABC TV.
When the government spends nearly half a billion dollars and the Society invests 300 million, it cannot be concluded that this is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The excretion of Jim Niclus Romana, Danny Didro, may be characterized by exceptional order and historical details, but it is also difficult to understand what should be done.
The film, which took place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to her family's monastery.
When she began to rebel, she experienced the extreme cruelty of the satisfactory and became the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film is never released before sex or emotion — and that is all the trouble.
Because of its serious persistence, the movement is likely to be a test of the type of owner and for the auditor.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production, said the observer group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and explosives, declared in the fourth international monitoring group, while heavy shells were burning in the north, near one of the facilities where toxic substances were thought to be stored.
The fourth Syrian activist group also claimed that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
A declaration of the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
at the end of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization to destroy or "displace ineffective" Damascus all means of the production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow the mixture of chemical substances with absorbing gas and to fill them with ammunition.
The conclusion of what is actually the initial phase of destruction is an important element in the ambitious schedule, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus is still about to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
The country is estimated to have approximately 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including hot gas and nuclear-paralytic gas.
This statement was made during the brutal war in the fourth quarter of Safira, where, according to experts, there is a chemical weapon production facility and its storage site, which is reported by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights in Britain.
A group of activists, who had suffered losses through a network of activists in Syria, reported on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Basar Assad, 18,678 were governmental fighters and 187 Lebanese troops of Hezbollah.
Also among the casualties, as stated in the statement, there were 2202 military refugees and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to UN estimates of 25 July, 100,000 were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, that number has not been updated.
About 2 million people have been displaced from their homes by the conflict.
Assad's troops fought in Safire for several weeks, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were both victims on Thursday but did not produce specific data.
The armed forces highlighted the danger posed by inspectors of chemical weapons under the short term of their mission to rescue Syria from the toxic arsenal in the aftermath of the ongoing civil war.
The ODA statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its command was “now satisfied that it had verified and saw all the critically important means of production and equipment for mixing/reduction declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification, visiting 21 of the 23 objects declared by Damascus.
They could not visit two security stations, the inspectors said.
In the fourth CMO, it stated that both sites, according to the Syrian declaration, were “disrupted and... the items of the chemical weapons programme contained in them have been transferred to other declared sites which have been verified”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the facility in Safire was one of the two places that ODA inspectors could not visit.
Syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be approved by the Executive Committee of the ODA next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the Monitoring Group of Ahmet Usumji in a comment published by the WHO.
For the past three years, civil war has been facing rebels, mostly Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, who are members of its Al-Alavites sect, in response to Shiit Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there was a strong explosion in the medium of PWO in the Syrian coastal province of Latvia.
The reason is unknown, he said.
Anger on account of the arrest of the organizers of the battle in Bali
The remaining 202 families who were killed by the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence of the last contractors before the court and claimed that the Umar Patek should be shot.
A flight that spent nearly 10 years in refugee camps as one of the most sought-out people in South-East Asia was sentenced to 20 years of deprivation of liberty for its role in the construction of explosive devices used during the battle.
He may be released for 15 years if he receives a conditional or temporary release.
The 45-year-old judge was found guilty of mass murder as a result of a two-night attack on two clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and ten more injured.
It was also recognized as responsible for a number of other charges related to terrorism, including in the wave of explosions of the Church throughout Indonesia at the birth of the year 2000.
The prosecutors needed a life term, although they might insist that a person called a “resident” should be sentenced to death by the master of the production of explosive devices.
This decision has undermined the painful memories of the mother of Perta John Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old daughter, Jane and Jenny in the course of Patek and his commissaries nearly ten years ago.
As soon as she held her knees, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must stand before the firing squad, said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day, knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari club was destroyed when a mass explosive device was brought into operation, which was placed in the parked furnace, immediately after 11 evenings of 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a dead terrorist shot a bullet 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma and died three times, subject to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that the Patek had to divide the three other members of the “Jema of Islam”, responsible for the bloody war, namely Amrosi, Muhammad and Imma Samudri, who had been sentenced four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
Keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Twenty years after 202 people were killed and hundreds were injured — that is not so much.
The trip is the last of the parties to the battle in Bali, before the court.
He hid for nearly ten years, but eventually he was detained in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad in January 2011, where American troops killed former leader Al-Qaida, Usam Ben Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent indicated that the investigation was evidenced that the Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to rebuild the link between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't come back," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret the pain he caused to others.
The sentence was issued in advance of the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, which will be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“It will be very late this year,” said Mrs. Cortin.
The Patek can still appeal for his sentence.
FAU: “Aeroplanes can now use jets on the plane (not to call from the mobile phone)”
The passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as such a change will take place, depending on the airline, FAO administrator Michael Wart said at the press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to FAU how their aircraft meet new guidelines and that they update their training benefits for the members of the flight crew and the rules on the board of devices in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAO stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that already submitted plans.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the increase in the use of electronic devices very soon,” said FAO.
At present, passengers are obliged to turn off their smartphones, planes and other devices as soon as the airport door closes.
They must not re-launch them until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain does not get "good".
Passengers must disable their devices again when aircraft is reduced to landing and not included until the aircraft is landed on the ground.
In accordance with the new guiding principles, aircraft whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may be allowed to use these devices at the time of landing, landing and routing, the FAU stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Shipowners, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy is well implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier in order to achieve it), this will be an uninterrupted option,” said Gleijding.
We have stopped feeling “stupid at school” when the matter comes to an end.
The Agency, however, has reported that the use of the Internet for services, exchange of e-mails, text messages or data uploads would be prohibited at a level of less than 10,000 feet.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, schedules and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, no word with friends remains an intellectual game in which an actor Alex Baldwin played his death machine in 2011 when a disturbing case occurred: an actor was taken off the American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on the landing.
Even harder devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in the trunk office because they can harm anyone if they fly across the hall.
Calls from mobile phones in the field will also continue to be banned.
The Federal Commission on Communications, rather than FAO, shall be the regulatory authority on telephone calls.
FAU may remove a ban on certain electronic devices during landing and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Safety Council, CBS News national security expert, stated that hundreds of phones were still considered to be dangerous.
“Telephones are really a problem, not only because they are potentially able to create slots for navigation devices, but we know from the FCS that they can create slots for more than a hundred connections when the plane is in the air,” Rozenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee established by FAO to examine this issue recommended that the Government should allow for greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on FAO has increased in order to reduce the restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the Senator-Democrat of the state of Missouri Claire McCaskil, claim that there are no major security reasons for bans.
The compliance with restrictions will also become increasingly difficult, as the use of devices became universal.
Some studies show that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAO began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to a communication of links to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech journalists at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generation of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as a sustainable electronic mix.
The airlines offer passengers the use of Wi-Fi at a creaser height over the past few years.
Aeroplanes modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more sustainable.
The overwhelming majority of liners are adapted to the wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Uert said.
Electronic devices today usually derive radio signals much lower than previous generation.
E-book reading devices, for example, only remove minimum signals when browsing pages.
But the signals become stronger when devices load or send data.
Among those who were able to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices were Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the entire aircraft with their devices to read the Kindle e-book and fly to check the problems, but did not find them.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices poses any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Association stated that it considers the shifts from the devices to be real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots that confirmed that the devices could create slots for aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to request passengers to remove devices during landings under limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step towards meeting passengers who are now using a number of technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAO recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dou, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Automobiles can carry out tests for driving rights
Exchanges in driving rights can be accepted by private companies with their own computerized vehicle.
This is what Commersant wrote with reference to the Government ' s draft decree on vehicle management.
According to the newspaper, there are currently about 30 such vehicles in Russia.
It is expected that students of such a “primary” vehicle will be able to calculate the results of internal testing.
In doing so, the Gosavto inspection will be carried out every six months to monitor the conduct of the examinations.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the students do not give up for the first time, such a school will be deprived of the time.
The technical requirements for vehicles contained in the draft Government regulation shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in dual-school technology.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycling holders of category A rights will be required to conduct an examination under urban conditions.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies have been unable to hire foreign leaders with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to get Russian rights after the examination.
A bird flying in a safe place with a bow station in the North Sea is cast back into the wild
A bird that had been airborne on the beach after being found in a state of oil in the North Sea was thrown back into the wild.
This waterbird was placed in a helicopter sent to Aberdin last month and was then released by the Scottish Office of the Society for the Prevention of Cruel Treatment of Animals (SPCA) at the Alloa Rescue Centre.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: “This waterway is, in most cases, a winter migration from northern Europe, which has fallen into the atmosphere of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was obsessed and could find shelter on the oil roof.
He said, “It was not possible for her to go out again, so we were sent to help her.”
The water was healthy and in good condition until it was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to collect business representatives and to determine what changes to the well-being and workplaces of Britain would like to see in relation to the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a wide range of businesses in Britain, by size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to the countries that are modernising and growing while the EU countries are stable.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than the long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-dumping regulations to production laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction on the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of the Brussels regulation are now exceeding the benefits of the entry into the trading area of Europe, with even 40 per cent of large enterprises, the most traditionally European-based companies.
Finally, our review of business leaders has shown that a clear majority would want Britain to conduct a course to change the treaty and to the EU based on trade rather than policy.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is “a major change” that will return power to Britain.
The high rates of change in the Treaty and the more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent increase in the vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this review shows that British business supports his plan to review the conditions of the UK EU membership.
It also shows that business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of force back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and become increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters into a more tighter economic and financial union.
The priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our review show, this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.
Officials of the United States are listening to a personal phone call from the Pope of Rome
The activities of the Vatican are under the ongoing control of the American Special Service.
The new documents from Edward Snoudden's collection show that the United States survey had heard all the talks of the former Pope Benedict, and now the Pope of France has been fully guarded.
His phone began to listen to him before he became the head of the Vatican.
There was also a process of selecting a new pope.
What was significant in the United States.
The special service was connected to hundreds of cardinals who were gathered in Rome to elect the Pope.
The telephones of the residents were also heard where the conclaves lived.
The American spies listened to all the main prosecutors on the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable to Washington.
The Panoram magazine says that the "great ears of the United States" continued to reopen the talks of the crossing until the end of the 12th March.
It is claimed that the United States has appointed the archipelago of Bergolio as the future Pope of Rome since 2005.
The U.S. investigation also included negotiations on the election of the new President of the Bank of Vatican.
The Italian newspaper states that the United States Embassy continues to work in the secret group of CRU and ABB operators providing information on policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has kindly declared that he does not care about the American "study", even if it does.
The U.S. leadership in the Holy Fathers has no secrets.
The snowboarder for the Olympic Cup was especially photographed
The Russian Bank released a memorial note on the city of Soci, where the Olympic Games are already being held in the winter.
The name of the buyer is 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already actively ironing on the memory of the banknote.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a banker can be found in the banks.
In particular, the StockExchange photo is free of charge, where this photo is dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in the photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic Bank is executed in a blue-deep gamma.
On the one hand, there's a snowboarder flying over Soci, a type of Olympic stadium and a bird.
The author of the banknotes is Paul Bushuev, who won a competition among the students of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repina.
It was noted at the presentation that several types of sport were considered - mountaintop, tricycle and trampling, but they were selected by snowboard because it was relatively young.
According to the source of the "Immediate" near the CB, the regulator does not share the public's view of the wide spread of the image of the snoobardist from the Olympic Bank and are now investigating the situation.
And there's not too much concern about the noise around the Olympic Bank.
The head of the press office, Ms. Natalia Nikiforova, said that all the discussions on the beach were ridiculous.
The banker's snowboarder will return right on the pictures on the network - on the left - explained Nikiforova.
The person at the photo session to create a dot was taken from different points, then a final image was chosen on him, a character behind a sono-of-a-bitch.
She also noted that copyright laws were not distributed on the Olympic Bank, as the artist received wages for work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image at the Olympic Cup was positive.
The visibility of the image on the cube - plus for its movement - is considered by the Executive Director of the NP "Russbrand" Alexei Popovicov.
Evidence of a percentage of the similarity of images to the image and in the photobanks is difficult enough, so requests for intellectual property to be made on this image are not likely to be made.
The first Olympic Bank was held in China - to the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 a memorial note was issued on 10 June.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Law banning Russians from drinking less beer
The Russian beer has a bad attitude.
According to their estimates, the consumption of beer in the country in the coming year remains at an early level, and this is best done.
Although the businessmen were much counting on growth.
For them, the current year is a failure: sales fell by 7 per cent.
Either way, the head of one of the country's largest beer companies, the President of the Council of the Russian Federation of Beefs, Isaac Sheeps, at the 3rd Annual Conference of the Institute of Adam Smith, "Tovari of daily demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed in the public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, as the country has seen significant increases in the production and processing of beer in the past few years, reports Sheps' listeners.
In no country in the world, there is such a severe restriction on the beer market, which is not foreseen to introduce all new and new illegal prohibitions that are justified in the fight against alcohol abuse.
Pivovar visited that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing the level of alcohol abuse did not have a special impact, but all new initiatives were constantly under way.
More than all of the beer producers have been subjected to this year's ban on selling spirits in cheeses.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Sheeps.
In the future year, there are two forecasts.
Optimistic is the one that Sheeps spoke about: pancake sales remain at the previous level.
Pessimistics are still 2-3 per cent.
In order to maintain their earnings, businessmen have to leave the classes counted on the mass user in the "premium" class: beer will become less, but it will be dangerous.
In the meantime, the radical effects of the drop in sales with a small amount of spirit still remain to be seen.
"In my observation, the level of the disease of alcoholism remains approximately the same level as that reported by Dr. Alexei Sotnik.
True, it has increased the proportion of those who have been drinking heavily alcoholic beverages, as well as those who have been “subscribed” to spirit-containing tanning beverages of the Yaguara kind, while ten years ago, they have been dominated by “drink” alcohol.
In September, 600 people were fired from Ford's Car Company in the University.
According to the trade unions, all who were released received compensation.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is more pressing than the problems of workers.
At the meeting, SacSa Aleksey Etmanov stated that approximately 600 people had been reduced to the Ford company in the University.
In his statement, this took place in September, then on the voluntary release programme, which was developed together with the Organization ' s trade union, some 600 persons were employed.
Workers who decided to leave on their own have been offered a number of fees for “golden parachutes”.
As a result, the overwhelming majority left their jobs on their own.
According to Etmanov, however, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna work out.
However, in the next two years, the authorities have not planned to adopt any support programmes for the hard-to-equipped enterprises,” he explained, adding that when the budget was adopted, the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
This information is not downloaded or confirmed in Ford.
We expect an answer from the company, and as soon as it appears, we are obliged to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of labour in the Ford factory in Velvologska have been in progress for a long time.
Thus, for example, the company's plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Previously, the factory had applied for a stop in the production of cars.
As a result, a demand for Ford in Russia was called for.
According to Petrostat, the industrial output in Lenoblast was reduced by 5.4 per cent by nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
Mobiles can be used in the United States during flight and landing
The new rules on safe use of mobile devices at the time of flight and landing have been approved in the United States, reports BBC.
It is expected that American airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and plans throughout the race, and new rules will begin to operate by the end of 2013.
However, the Internet connection for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights of less than 3 kilometres.
As a result of the danger of inter-shipment of aircraft, hundreds of votes will remain under ban.
Travellers will thus be allowed to read e-books, play on plans and other magazines and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines have to convince the U.S. Civil Aviation Administration that they are able to cope with the alleged influence of aircraft and aircraft management.
According to the source, for example, the United States may also review existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flights.
The Russian Mafia in the United States has finally established a new name - the Brethren Circle.
This week the Russian Mafia black list in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbekistann and Israeli citizens.
One of the Russians was a famous singer, Gregory Leps, who was suspected of being carrying money to members of the group.
However, in the black list of 22 persons involved in the Brethren Round and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt the existence of such an organization.
“The "Branch Circle" statement is more likely to attempt to unite various criminal groups,” said an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeotte.
In his view, the Brethren circle reflects the popular view of the Russian Mafia.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” Mr. Galeoti of the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeetti agreed to a professor at George Mason Liz Shelly University.
"If they are active, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime says.
In the middle of the last year, Mark Galehoti suggested that the "Brade Circle" would unite more and more of the closest Russian enemies in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Dad Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashwili and Zechariah Kalauov, who completed the 2012 list, were closely linked to Grandpa Hasan and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came to Grandpa Hasanu as a member of the family.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeoti noted that some individuals had no relation to Usojan.
In his view, all of them were closer to common financial and criminal interests, such as drug delivery from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Brade Circle" by Gregory Lepsa - a beloved singer of President Vladimira Putin - attracted the attention of Kremlin.
Of course, we are counting on our American partners to receive more detailed information on why such a decision was taken, said the press secretary of the head of the State of Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
As with the interests of all citizens of the RFI, its interests will be protected.
The Head of Gasproma Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is calling for a new gas evaporation.
The start of the construction of the South River gas pipeline in Bulgaria was one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Head of Gasproma.
“Today there has been a marked event: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream gas station, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Aleksey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South River is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract gap between the Gaza Strip and its partners in Ukraine, where most of the gas for Russia is intended for Europe, increases the risk for ordinary routes, speaks for officials.
Miller said that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always removed”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South River at a reduced price, as soon as the whole project is started in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries that were still on the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project-producing capacity of the pipeline consists of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Saratsk area, the driver of Peugeot went up to the meeting area of 115 km through Odesa-Rini, and met with a bus with six people.

The police detained the suspect at Los Angeles airport.
Previously, it has been known that one of the airport terminals had opened a window.
The police and rescue services evacuated people from the building.
The criminal was injured in a police shooting, and there was no information about his identity.

Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual crimes even before charges against Jonathan Lord, as reported by the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual crimes against children prior to the 2011 charges against the childcare agency staff at Karingbahe Jonathana Lorda, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission ' s opening statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philip Haira, asked about one case when an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes and the other, when the instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Heir said that Gail Fernes, a lawyer who was assisting the Commission, knew about the first case but did not know about the second case.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in its introduction to the Commission, also admitted that “there were external verifications of YMCA that YMCA was in the first line for the safety of children”.
The witness commissions report that YMCA has been notified that it has received a second of four possible evaluations of the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and the community in August of this year.
Mr. Heir, who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, recognized that he and the following leadership had failed to persuade Lord, and was also unable to provide a clear understanding of his obligations relating to reporting violations of the child ' s security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years at his work in YMCA.
He was in prison for at least six years.
However, Mr. Heir rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA had prevented staff members from reporting violations of Lord's child security.
The staff showed that they had observed violations, including that Lord was with the children, was personally following them, sitting them on their knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play his cell phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of Lord, asked for training for her children because she was concerned about her behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnet, the child care manager at the YMCA office in Karingbache, who was the leader of Lorda, “a scary and often difficult person”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanation of staff having been unable to report the situation to his superior leaders.
Soon, he said, their friendship with Lord brought them into the picture of the need to report.
Mr. Heir said that he had given the YMCA Council of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization from "Jonathan Lord's " was not intended to provide information" by the staff, and the Council agreed with it.
Mr. Heir said that the decision to force staff to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the charges had been made was adopted by the Director-General of YMCA on the care of children by Liam Whitley.
He said that this was intended to prevent a number of evidence, but that was “perceived” and that decision was being carried out badly.
YMCA New South Wales was not safe for the children of the organization during its work in the period 2009-2011, and Professor Stephen Smolboun of the University of Griffy told the Commission of Experts on Children's Growth.
He said that there were “some serious problems” in the collection, selection, training, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings are suspended until 20 December.
Week of fashion in San Paulo.
She's considered her family not just a manipulative, but a star.
Despite the fact that Jiel Bundschen had for some time left work, she had come to work on maternity leave, these days and this week's deficit.
The absence of many months did not prevent her from keeping her position on the floor and on the fifteenth floor.
Life remains the most highly paid model of peace.
This time, she was involved in the Kolčchi defilament.
The end of the week of fashion - usually the most interesting shows.
It's kind of what the stylist Lino Willaventura did.
Marke is more than 30 years old, in parallel with the production of pre-a-ports of the luxury class, the model works actively in theaters and cinematographs, fashioning spectacles and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 companies and companies involved in the textile industry and the peace of fashion took part in the final week of fashion in San Paulo.

Tony Blair said he used the chance to return as Prime Minister of Great Britain, but admitted that the return was small.
The 59-year-old policy, in an interview on the fifth year of retirement, expressed its views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since retiring in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has largely avoided discussion of British policies, limiting the majority of his comments to foreign affairs and the role of Ambassadors in the 4th Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to the question whether he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, on the London Evening Standard, he said: “Yes, of course, but if that is not going to happen, so ....”
Major coach Milano Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret at the failure of the 10th round of the Italian champion with Lacio.
The expert also noted that the failure of the old has caused a series of injuries to the leading players.
I'm so sorry we couldn't win, it's because of allegory's words.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
We didn't allow Lacio in the first team.
In Rome the second was bought, but in general I can't say we lost concentration.
We had to win.
In the past season, we have met the target of the fall in the League of Champions.
Now we're leaving the graph, but this is due to a series of key footballers' injuries.
Rammy and Honda?
It's very good games, of course.
But our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who's held a high-level meeting.
The experts in the Cardiff's transport activities to fight for the Losada Year, knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, had taken his first step, this little girl, with her foot-and-mouthed Sietland Mrs. Toffi, had gone through three rounds of rice so that she could easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
This unique pair — the same growth — received high external assessments, behaviour and style at the annual competition center in the city of Radri, near Cardiffa.
In public view of the background of men and women in high - speed motorcycles, he slammed his hat and took pride in two-year-old Toffy.
The judges commended Fentona for its well-developed capacity to deal with abuses over the past year.
Toffi received a higher assessment of the external nature and nature.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third day of birth in March last year, and since that time, he has been working with the Shetland prairie every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy are a beautiful dutty."
They had a lot of opponents, but these two went with a golden cube and a chauffeur.
It was only his second speech with Toffy, and we were all in a hurry when he won.
The very unknown people in the arena considered him to be so lenient that they wanted to photograph him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, who is not far from Ebb-Will in South Wales, is following his aunt Sharon Hawels, who has been a prostitute for more than 10 years.
Ms. Hawkes said: “All the audience was injured, and all cried out for approval and applause.”
He ran after the sand all along the arena and, although he seemed so short, did his job well.
Fenton has no idea of the animals — he likes bad figs, tractors, and farms, and he has two shoes that he cares about.
As he began, he will soon take part in the Year of the Year, and I am sure he will speak well.
The representative of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his mind.”
Together they're a great team.
The judges noticed Fentona and Toffi's appearance and how they presented themselves at the show.
They appreciate the harmony of the words of the poet and the poet, Fenton and Toffi, who were the best at the race.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive band, and he really looked good in his role.
Public call by the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization is in place”
The Chinese newspaper, published in the first half of the appeal for the release of the accused in the file of the reporter, must be reorganised, reports the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yunço.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken over the receipt of false articles about a company with a public share of property.
The New Express should now proceed with “the process of full correction of errors”, as the regulator reports.
The “correction of errors” directive came from the Government of Guangdong in the field of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the New Express newspaper owned by Yangcheng Evening News Group had published several false reports of the company's registered company Zoomlion branch for the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The direction of the "New Express" edition was deorientated,” stated in the regulator's statement.
He reported that the decision had been taken “to impose an administrative appeal on Chen Yunzhou in the form of a call for his reporting licence”.
It also “commanded Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the responsible journalists and make immediate changes to the New Express Guide”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he stated financial violations in the construction of the company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published on the first half two appeals for his release, stating that he supported his journalistic activities.
However, Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, acknowledging that he had published false articles about money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion’s company, as well as all the news media industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he said to the public news company CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my fault.
Following Mr. Chenya ' s confessions, the New Express made an apology to the first floor, stating that the paper could not properly verify his report.
Recently, a number of suspected suspects have made television recognitions.
Experts say that the practice of killing confessions in China has continued to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from having anyone to agree on their own.
U.S. tunnel discovered — Mexico for drug trafficking, equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, provided by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was found.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel, which consists of nearly six football fields, connects the warehouses of the city of Tihuan (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with undetected stocks that facilitate the hidden cargo of drugs.
Tunnel was closed before the drug was transmitted, as stated by the authorities.
According to judicial documents, the law enforcement officers confiscated eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine while the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement officers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of their sentence, prison terms of 10 years shall be reduced to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, opposers use extensive underground drilling channels.
Tunnel is the eighth major event in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the harvest of the fruit mariguana in October, which placed a difficult task for drug users to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a long passage of some 700 yards, equipped by railways, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tikhuan to the two warehouses of San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions are increasing from November to November

British police are sending Assanzu a notice of extradition
The British police have today issued a notice of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanja, who was detained in Ecuador's Embassy in London and asked for asylum.
In Scotland, it was stated that they had sent an Australian 40-year-old “official requirement to be given” with a request to appear in the police station, adding that if he did not comply with this requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanzu is threatening extradition in Sweden for sexual crimes after he has exhausted his opportunity under British law when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June, he joined Ecuador's Embassy in London, asking for political asylum in that South American country.
Scotland Yard “has forced a 40-year-old man to make an official request that he be admitted to the police station on the day and time after our election,” said the press secretary.
It continues to undermine the conditions of freedom under the loan.
The mission refused to comment on the order of the police.
Assassin is afraid that he will be expelled from Sweden to the United States to make possible accusations against him in Spain after the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic attacks on the WikiLeaks website.
A driver running at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his leg, cut at £1,000
The driver was fired at £1,000 for driving speeds up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the leg.
35-year-old Andrew Houi of Tiptrey, Essex, was noted for his Mercedes Benz's role in the A120-year-old race in Breintry on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink on his leg.
In the World Court of Colchester Howay, he recognized the charge of conduct without due consideration and attention.
The addition to his driver's approval of seven tax bills resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Houi also had to pay costs of £90 and additional collection to assist victims of £100.
Tax for foreign owners of real estate will lead to the collapse of London
The target was a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measures, but expected a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, set the rate of government expenditure of 7 per cent for households worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own households in company rather than as natural persons.
At this point, the lady for housing in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea regions, comprising 708 million pounds in the financial year 2012/13, has already exceeded the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Hamber together.
Mr. Cook said: “After the expansion of the house and the introduction of this legislation against removal, it was very difficult to claim that the tax on the property of the property is reduced regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system”.
“But this can lead to the fact that some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in London or that its current owners do not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class real estate, above 5-10% of the price-based housing market, in the rich south-west London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledton, has increased to 11.8% recorded last year.
According to Savills, prices in the centre of London continued to show sustainable growth of 5.6 per cent per year, but they have been actively developing the “impact market” with the overall prices in the south-west, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have come to light on how the movements of the dog’s tail are linked to its shape.
Early studies have shown that sufficient dogs fly at the right side (from the point of view of dogs), while raised dogs are at the leftmost.
But now scientists say that other dog family representatives can note and respond to these dark differences in the wild.
Professor George Vallortgara, neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “Howocho knows that the left and right sides of the brain are different in the formation of designers who are positive or negative.
Here we tried to look at it in other ways.
He added that, like humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and the right side of the body and the right side, and two halfs play a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the diverse impact of other dogs, researchers have observed animals when they watch movies about other dogs.
They measured the rate of heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes sent to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortgara said: “We have shown dogs video with dogs, either naturalist versions or silhouettes to escape any other challenging factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and send the tail to the left or right. ”
When the animals saw that in the rest of the non-expressive dog the wheel was moving right (from the point of view of the floating tail) they were completely weakened.
But when they saw that the horse was coming from the far left (again from the point of view of the flying dog), their hearts were relieved and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortgar said he didn't think dogs were deliberately interconnected with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should worry about and what they should not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs, and their frequency is often related to more friendly behavior, and the right of the party is less friendly, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
The researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and pressures more insight into the emotions of their animal.
The expert on dog behavior, John Bradshaw, invited by a professor at the University of Bristol Medical School, said that this was not the first study to check whether dogs were important to the left and right sides.
Last year a team of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads left if they look at an aggressive dog and right when they look at a sufficient dog.
In another science study at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The causes were more often due to the work of the dog when it was driven to the left but not to the right rather than to become enthralled, the opposite attitude towards the Italian study.”
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals in films or robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs respond to these dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence that two-sixes of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their noise is sometimes sent to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys are performing a concert in Glazgo due to the illness of Alex Turner.
The Rock Group Arctic Monkeys held a concert in Glazgo after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Chieffield Group was to be held at the city concert hall of Hydro on Friday.
However, vaccinator Alex Turner stopped them from taking the show.
This statement was made by the group after it was obliged to postpone the LG Arena concert in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official Arctic Monkeys website, it was reported: “After the decision to transfer the show to the Burmingham LG Arena tonight and after the medical treatment of Arctic Monkeys, the show must also be postponed at the Hydro station in Glazgo on Friday, 1 November”.
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with "laringitis", and unfortunately he was unable to speak."
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now be held on 20 November, and the show at Glazgo on the Hydro Square will be held on 21 November.
All tickets on this show remain valid.

Pope Francis calls the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will lead the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time during his term of service on 22 February, as announced in the fourth Vatican.
Cardinals are the highest spirits in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so that France will appoint its first group of people who will eventually take part in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, he could no longer take part in the pope's elections, which was the preference of the 120 "Caldinal electoral group".
In proclaiming this news, the Vatican Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a collection of all current cardinals, known as a convent, would be held before the funeral ceremony.
“The Pope of France has decided to report earlier on his decision to organize a concert in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voice said that by February the number of cardinals would likely be reduced.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it is necessary to restore the number of cardinals to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age, as much as he wishes.
Consistency will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since France's election in March of this year, as Valero said.
At this point, there is a kind of preoccupation for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It would be interesting to see if a new cardinal pope from other regions of the world would be appointed to restore the balance,” he noted.
In South America, there are 40 per cent of Catholics, but they are represented by a poor number of cardinals.
It will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the French Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who are commissioned to seek ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope had decided on his own.
"Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that "as far as possible" that France would turn to cardinals at the Council.
But we weren't in that situation before, all this is for us first.
Valero said that the popes usually took the cardinals from large incomes, but France “full of surprises, so we don’t know who he will call.”
GM calls for a number of new pickups in the United States to repair the back of the seat
General Motors Co is calling for nearly 12,000 new peaks of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to address the problems with manual control of the seat back, as reported on Friday by the United States authorities in the field of road safety.
In some of the pixels, the front seats may have a defect in the spinal cord mechanism.
As a result, seat belts do not conform to the federal safety standards of traffic by the headmasters.
“The driver and passengers may not be adequately protected by the hit of the vehicle, by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
The so-called models were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of the GM pickup began in June and is the most important start of the car in serial production for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the failure in the first half of October.
The national road safety administration could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government ' s work, which reduced the growth of car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra, which were modernized for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, as the GM company stated on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 pieces of silverado and 16,503 pixels of Sierra.
GM operations at the New York Foundation Board increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday to $37,47.
Cricket of Obama's electoral expectations
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the disstructionism of the Republicans to bring praise to the net.
Designism cannot serve as a justification for the problems with a web site reformed by the comprehensive health system, attacks by non-pilots
The 2008 Obama campaign memorabilia is an unforgettable reminder of what might be possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible book in those days.
I thought this book would inspire me during my second course of medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It is called the “Victory for Victory”, and it is a reminder of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barak Obama.
When I end up writing reports about my patients at night and lie in bed, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and statements could capture the spirit.
The election victory was exciting, and the leading news programmes were slowing down to reflect this historic moment.
My classmates cried out with joy, and my parents took all the magazines they could find.
The young strategy team had to come to the White House, and the people were ready to change.
During Obama's entry into office in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return here is a grave awakening, like the eviction from the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they are spoken of as a distant reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I left my first ballot, the changes have indeed taken place.
It was because I couldn't even imagine myself.
I give Obama due credit for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the available medical assistance law to the conclusion of our war from Iraq, to the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, do not speak”, the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party designism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the option of choosing public health and closing the base in Guantánamo among others.
But after an unlimited number of times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and witnesses, I ended up explaining what I could provide.
I've reached the point of political optimism.
The opposition of the Republicans cannot justify the hearing of foreign leaders or the execution of innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on American private life by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of vendors who reveal the wrongness of the Government.
He could not explain the murder of American citizen Anvar al-Aafari without a trial and the consequences or non-compliance with the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to keep the media shut down are “the very aggressive... since the administration of Nixon”.
And recently, he cannot justify the failure to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the available medical assistance law.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I be 18 years old to understand that guidance may be contrary to the political campaigns that led him?
Clearly, election is not a prelude programme of action, as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and events such as the disaster in Newton.
However, above all the examples I have listed above, it is evident that they have been a significant choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted again in favour of Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidate.
Mitt Romni was an impenetrable and grave alternative, saying he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believe that, in my second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, is justified by the hope we have heard for so long.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped by less than 45 per cent this week, it was much harder to return in 2008.
This makes me look forward to the many promises that have been made.
This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton had made Obama an insult at the first elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal clothing and remain faithful to their purpose.
"I want us to return our attraction," he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The comments made in this commentary are exclusively of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer argues that Tony Abbota has a conflict of interest in childcare leave.
Member of the billionaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Ebbot has a conflict of interest in childcare, as his daughters can be arrested and taken out of it.
It was a proud industry with an unregulated dispute on the amount of $6 million of carbon taxes, which made this statement when he tried to get rid of the issue of whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Party of Palmer may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be of decisive importance in the decision on the abolition of taxes on carbon emissions and on mining activities.
However, Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbot's daughters would personally be rewarded by political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interests when it comes to the payment of childcare leave, because if any of these daughters are taken into custody, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they are given leave,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the Electoral Commission officially announced Mr. Palmer's victory in the battle against the Sanchain-Kost electoral district, with 53 votes in favour after the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the voting procedure to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Ebbot Francis and Brigitte.
Should the decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
"We need a more perfect system," he said.
Why should we not have such a system so that we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get results at 6:30 a.m. the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of a flag for labeling in the leaflets.
That's because they can keep the results if they don't like anyone?
Using the karandas in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is considering the possibility of electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain-Kost and would be “very serious” with regard to his new work.
Public service is expected.
“We do not receive any reward except through history, because we can serve this area at critical times,” he said.
RBS removes two currency derivatives
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily withdrew from the work of two contractors in its currency operation unit, according to information from two persons who were aware of the situation, which is another evidence that the global verification of the proposed currency manipulation regulators is strictly subject to trade.
Some of the world's largest banks, including the U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with regulators in the world's largest financial market, with daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two corridors will be the first RBS staff to be removed during the developing investigation, which will be interrupted by a scandal related to the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
By refusing to comment on the derogation, the Bank confirmed that this month it had received requests for information from regulatory authorities.
“Our ongoing investigation on this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” reported two weeks ago in the bank.
Last month, the reported persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail records and e-mails that had received and sent it to the former Triad of the United Kingdom Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as he is known, was granted permission to his current position as European trade leader in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the leader of European trade unions in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardner, the former money dealer in Barclays and U.S., was removed from the work of the Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these contractors were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the persons informed.
The Bank reported on this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said it would investigate the proposed currency manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six governing bodies in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the anti-dumping authority of Switzerland Weko, the FCA, the Ministry of Justice of the United States and the Department of Monetary Affairs of Hong Kong — consider claims that banks entered into a currency market agreement.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulatory authorities, who said that they were aware of the situation of the person.
Banks are looking at mercenaries and e-mails for several years in the search for crimes.
News of the audits have increased in the field of activities, which has been one of the major sources of income of the investment banks' incomes in recent years, which this year has faced difficulties because the low volume of currency decreases the potential for buyers.
Some banks have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and high-value currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior contractors say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the large daily trade on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of their domestic banks means that “you can begin to influence the market at a relatively low price”.
The news came on the same day when the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that it had dropped one of its trade unions in the London Stock Exchange this week, after it had lost almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that this issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama ' s Health Act
The Supreme Court of the United States has today decided that Barak Obama's health law is constitutional, which is a major success of Obama's administration.
In a vote of 5 against 4, the judges decided that separate provisions under the Law on the Protection of Patients and Health, which require citizens to obtain medical insurance by 2014 or pay taxes, were constitutional in accordance with the authority of the tax-paying Government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, urged four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Skalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also left the remaining sections of this 2700-page law in force and decided that the requirement of the Health Act for States to improve compliance with the Medicaid programme or that they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme was not institutionally compulsory.
The bill was sought to block 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The Act was strongly opposed to each of the main Republican candidates in presidential positions during the 2012 initial election season, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romny.
Football — Why Different?
In the House of Lords, policies and experts under the Open-Tribunal Policy have been talking about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: prohibiting football in the North Caucasus because of this game, there are scandals and differences.
Spicer Sergei Narishkin recalled recent developments in Birulewa and said that to reduce the "pressure rate in society" policy and media should be correct in references.
He probably had a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinowski, who, in one of the television broadcasts, threatened to surround Cavca with a wheelchair if he didn't want to limit birth...
All speakers were also talking about measures to regulate migration from the SNA countries and on measures to harmonise relations between the peoples of Russia, which contributed to the debate on the complexity.
Maxim Grigorev said that the events in Birulev were "a model conflict that could have been prognosisd", but "we have too many people and institutions" and some seven blind children.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time had been practiced in Europe, was, in the public's opinion, lost, and had to look for its way.
The historian Yuri Peterov put great hope in the new single author of history.
"There is still a need to create an aid in the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schools in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagestan, and the opposite," he said.
Gennadius Züganov proposed that criminal responsibility be placed for "an appeal to Russia": "If you say on the radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and jailed for 20 years!"
Vladimir Girinowski was trying hard to "do not jump."
As usual, he accused journalists who posed painful and serious national problems to public discussion: “In the dust of Polishism, there is nothing to say.”
The leader of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Vassiliev, advised journalists to conclude a "card" and agree to hold discussions on this subject in a timely manner, and then these commitments could be taken into account by themselves and by policies.
We have adopted about 30 laws governing migration, and in general, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he introduced a law that places responsibility for the international peace in their territory to regional and municipal authorities.
But there was no division of the law by the People's Democratic People's Democratic Republic of the Congo: it did not have a "tutorial idea of the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and boundaries.
Thus, the entities will deal with the different levels of these powers.
Moreover, the municipalities do not have the resources needed to deal with such complex issues, nor do they have the means to make use of the methodological recommendations that they might use, nor does the centre give them...
The head of the Committee on National Affairs, Gadjimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special office called the Ministry of National Security, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tishkov, who was headed by a similar agency, later released, spoke against it.
It is sufficient to have at the federal level a special person, "Minister without a portfolio", to whom it could be addressed, if so.
"We are on our way to the end, in the near future, and it is very important for representatives of different ethnic and religious groups to speak against provocation, and this work must be given valuable information support," said the representative of the CPR on relations with the University of Chaplin.
No State's neutrality regarding dangerous ideology, including religion, should be considered not.
Oleg Nilov here gave a discussion in unexpected Russian: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be sought, but they don't interpret them that way, not that way," he said.
"Not that way" is the development of football: "It's a football player that beats the whole crowd, it's a flying bird, it's a fellow rocking each other...
Maybe we don't need that football?
There's another kind of sport - the rules are called...
"There will be no sport for their people in the world." He said with a loud voice.
There will be no one to play on the Kavsa River. Mr. Jirinowski has been involved here.
You're still driving them!
We need to know the national features, that's all the same thing that the Guardian has to offer.
In Yaroslavla there were representatives of the Moscow club, while playing with the local club.
The football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFS Steering Committee, Arthur Grigorjanc, reported that Cuba has been deployed to 500 thousand rubles, and has been transferred from the House to the "SE" Philippe PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Red Cross Club are applied in support of the Dagestana flag by patients at the tribunal during the 14th round of the trial.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We've studied all available materials.
For the wrong behavior of Cuban viewers, 500 thousand rubles have been reported.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patented claims by Nortel
A group of thousands of former Nortel patents filed a fourth round of patent cases against mobile phone producers, including Google, whose price was exceeded by Nortel's banking auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, who purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel's patent, filed claims for violation of patent rights in the US District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents include technologies that help to compare online search keywords with their advertising, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are preparing mobile phones working on Google Android operating system, which is extremely competitive with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel the original price of $900 million for patents.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, finally offering a total of $4.4 billion.
In the case of the patents of the Nortel Consortium Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly the patent library of Motorola.
“In spite of the failed attempt to acquire patents that are the subject of demand, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the court ruled.
Rockstar requires a higher compensation for Google's losses because he claims that the violation of patent rights by Google is deliberate, as required.
The first freely elected President takes an oath in Egypt
Muhammad Mursi has taken an oath, but the day of his arrest will hardly mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised "a new Egypt," when he made a vow, he became the first freely elected president of the country, a change in Hosni Mubarak, who was imprisoned 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He made a sworn oath before 18 judges in black houses in a court building on the bank of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Mursi at a solemn ceremony that was presented on public television.
“Today the people of Egypt laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, 60-year-old engineer with American education from the “Brattev-Muslim”, a fundamentalist group, most of which was banned from its 84-year existence by an organization serving as a mission for the cruel acts of other Governments.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursey arrived at a small court shortly after 11 o'clock in the morning.
Only a few hundred parties were gathered at the court building to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential bombing of Mubarak, the movement was only delayed for a short time in order to miss his autocolonate on a usually-lived road, which connects the city centre with the southern gardens.
Although Mursey has raised as an unwarranted “dangerous cross” of Bratev, his personal prestige has grown rapidly since his victory and his fifth speech, in which he has tried to present himself as a candidate not only Muslims, but all who want to bring to the end of the 2011 uprising against the author Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursi, who was dressed in a blue business suit with a red coat, to judges in the general wooden panels, where he took his oath.
Mursey later went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to do his inaugural thing.
He was granted official approval by the army orchestra performing the state gym, during which he stood “slowly”.
A military officer was present at the Feldmarshal Hussein Tantavi.
His visit was attended by the sound of Armia and the People — One Hand, which had been scheduled for hundreds of meetings in the principal lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a World Education Area, the Cairo University in the 1970s became a fleet of Islamic student groups.
Mursey took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the rebellion ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the authority of the president whose office was left by the military council to take action by the conscripted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court rather than before the Parliament as it was adopted, he did the will of the military, and this was a sign that the struggle for power would continue.
The Murcia thing on Tahrir Square was filled with the dramatic populist passions.
The regular meeting of the Timmen Engineers Association was held on the basis of the Jalutor Car Company.
As part of the event, a new line was presented for the production of electric tubes from the table.
As told by the business director of Dennis Gribanov, a new marketing study was conducted in 2011 by a new owner to study the market for permanent construction in the Tumen region.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric tube per month.
Thereafter, a decision was taken to modify the profile of the plant and plant equipment for their production.
Over 7,000 tons of production have already been downloaded this year.
More than 120 million rub lei were invested in the plant, and Dennis Gribanov told them.
In October a new state was launched, which allowed an increase in association.
It is used as a small tube profile, which is used for thievery agriculture, small forms of construction, and in furniture industry, as well as large for the construction industry.
We plan to increase production by 50,000 tons per year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the shift to another type of activity, the number of business staff has not decreased - it now comprises 157 people, with a further increase of over 50 staff.
Business retraining takes place, and the necessary specialists are removed from the existing.
In the coming year, a new food chain is planned to be filled up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another apartment, at the speed of production of the tube up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, businesses are planning to develop pipes that are used in housing-communal agriculture.
The management of the company aims to close up to 70 per cent of the requirements of the Timmen area in this product.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, advised production managers to pay greater attention to modernization of machinery enterprises.
To this end, public support forms of industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates for new equipment purchases and the cost of its licensing.
In the current year, 150 million rubles are intended to be allocated, two thirds of which have already been lost.
The latter commission, which will consider subsidization treaties, shall receive documents from undertakings until 15 November.
In addition, the budget is reimbursed for the participation of local producers in international brands.
The budget provides for the next year 150 million rubles that can be used to compensate for Lising Payments and Credits for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the market and 3 million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
Up to 72 million rubles are reduced to the refund of the ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tumen region for the oil complex.
According to Leonida Ostroumov, this form of support will be terminated in the future, as the reason for its introduction was the tax compensation for the profits incurred by oil companies paid in the area budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct spending obligations in the region.
In view of this, the Government considers direct support for industrial enterprises rather than through them to be financed by the oil industry.
The budget will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the prevailing situation with regard to oil.
The acquisition of equipment is a competitive advantage of the southern Timorese industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the medium-sized field of Russia, where the lower labour force is.
In addition, there is no clear question of the superiority of the new TNC-WR owner, Rosneftt, who has not yet placed its orders on the tween enterprises.
An agreement on the implementation of the Uwa project was reached in 2013 and its application for extension was not made.
At present, South-South enterprises specializing in the oil sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether the oil tax in the Uwatsk region will be paid in the region budget or will be reimbursed at the place where the new owner is registered.
Tomic works 240 hours for an extremist role in the Soviet Union.
The Lenin Regional Court of Tomska condemned the city ' s compulsory work of 240 hours, which placed in the social video of extremist orientation, reported to the RIA News on Friday by a press representative of the District Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page in a popular social network, which was added to the federal list of extremist materials.
In this regard, a criminal case was brought to light under article of the CFP “Acts aimed at incitement of hatred and hatred, as well as the humiliation of human dignity by the public”.
“The Lenin District Court considered the case in particular and recognized the man as guilty of the above-mentioned offence by imposing a punishment of 240 hours of compulsory work,” said the agency ' s companion.
She added that the man fully acknowledged his guilt.
Asarov promised the Ukrainians the price of goods after signing an association with the European Union
Ukraine's Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov was convinced that prices in the country would be significantly reduced after the country had signed an agreement on association with the European Union.
He made a statement during a meeting with his readers on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the Agreement and the entry into force of the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU would be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should also be reduced.
"It's about goods coming from EU countries," he wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be so direct and it will be addressed.
However, there must also be no price increases.
That is why the messages on the billboards that have recently appeared in our country quite a lot, that the association with the EU is a growing price, that is not so, or if it is more accurate to say, it is not."
Follow-up checking information on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media reported that a nurse in one of the children's gardens in the city of Bisca closed the child in the basement.
The investigators are currently explaining all the circumstances, as well as the legal assessment of the actions of the staff of the orphanage.
After the accusations in Eugenia Vasilieva, she spoke.
Eugenia Vasilieva, a person with almost a year's exposure to the media, has not yet commented on many publications in the press, both in Minoboron and on her personal relations with the Prime Minister of Defence of Anatolia Heartuk, her position and her commitment to valuable things.
However, on November 1st, Obonon Service's figure broke the silence.
In his interview with Life News Vasilieva, he said: "I mean, of course, the task was one: to remove any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence."
It was lucky that I had to give evidence, otherwise I would be thrown into prison.
Today, these threats have stopped.
We'll go to court and prove our innocence.
We believe in 100 percent in victory.
However, it can be concluded from the interview that, unfortunately, most of Vasiliev's comments were made about what he had nothing to do with taste.
It is likely that the official representative of SC RF Vladimira Markina said that in a collection of pictures that had collected a figure for the Obborne Service case, the bids had been found.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the owner, being convinced of his deep knowledge of art, acquired as champions of the world record.
However, an art experiment appointed by investigators after the arrest of these images has found that they do not have any artistic value and that they are, in fact, debts," Markin noted early in October.
Any pictures stolen by the Ministry of Defence...
Then they all admitted that they were not stolen from Minoboron, and they said that I had a taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I mean, it's just an indistinct," Vasilyeva says.
In this regard, whether she admitted her guilt in one of her 12 criminal episodes, Vasilieva said, "Of course not.
To admit something.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They just lead the people into error, here and there.
In addition, in response to today's CK RF statement that Vasilieva is excluded from the study of criminal matters, the lawyer stated that he and his client “did not know the facts of the case”.
What led to the discovery of Vasiliev's home arrest, so far not being associated with the press?
How could a woman not respond to a charge in a bad taste?
Or did the rights of Communist journalists a couple of days ago claim that she had “falled in a further stream under domestic arrest” because of the knowledge of Anatolia Serdukov's reconciliation with her and her return to her family home?
In his article "Serduks has returned to a woman?", a well-known military prosecutor, Victor Baranez, wrote: "The followers do not exclude that after this shock, she may become more probative in questioning."
Previously, Vasilieva had been charged with the illegal sale of the property of Minoboron.

A return trend appears to be observed in the Flight Centre.
The company has updated its projections for the full year and looks forward to record incomes from Australia and Great Britain.
The tourist company is now expected to have its main total annual income before tax is $325 to $340 million compared with the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If current trends are achieved, this will result in a 12-17 per cent increase compared to the recorded profit of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Terner said that the Flight Centre received 8 per cent of its revenue in the first half and began the second half with good indicators, especially on Sundays in Australia and Great Britain.
“For the period beginning of the year, we have been working for the benefit of our 10 countries, and for some of them for the full year, a record high income is expected before the percentage and tax contributions are paid,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the greatest benefits.”
In Australia, business in the field of long term in the second half of the year was reimbursed by a number of weaker domestic corporate travel markets.
In a similar way, in Britain, the Flight Centre business in the field of long-term well-being has been good, while corporate customers have suffered less.
Her business in the United States had compensated for losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to receive income in the third full year of debt.
Yesterday's Flight Centre shares increased to 3 cents until $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnoulian police found two playgrounds.
First worked in the Industrial Area on the Street of Uzelle.
At the time of the check in the game hall.
There were 24 cars in the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district of Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 slot cars used here.
The Russian Federation on Barnaulu reported that administrative material was prepared under the article “Illicit organization and the conduct of gambling”.
The technique was invented.
In the near future, the facts will be sent to the Courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has been severely treated with two sisters.
After he killed their bodies, he felt sorry for them.
As reported to the New Region in the press service of the GU MVD RF on the Sverdlovsk area, the day after the fire in a three-bedroom apartment on the street of Uralski, two women were found with signs of violent death.
Soon the identity of the deceased was established.
It was found that this sister, one of whom was a 44-year-old resident of Ekaterinburg, the second was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
The hottest apartment was taken away a few days ago.
His investigation was under private control by the chief police region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal organs are working on various versions of the murder, checking the alibi of former convicted citizens and persons involved in such acts.
In addition, it is established that for the purpose of the removal of the apartment, women had to live before they had to deal with what they had to do with.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, 19th - century novel, romantic poetry and modern British art literature from 1914.
The examination will also be presented with “non-programmed texts” to promote wider reading.
A common course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to conduct a separate language examination, with strong recommendations for selecting English literature as a separate exam.
In the morning, the Department of Education should issue new training programmes on English and mathematics, the first subjects subject to radical review.
It will make changes to other key elements in the next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure for secondary school out-of-school examinations, with a new system of evaluations and a lower rate of work.
Speaking in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Goov said that there had been “a broad consensus that we should reform our system of exams to restore public confidence”, stressing that school exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more robust”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year or three hours a week) than in most countries.
For comparisons, Australian schools spend an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
While the formal requirement would not allow more time to be allocated to mathematics, the sources in the coalition said that large-scale math exams combined with a higher rate in the rating table would be more likely to serve as an incentive to provide additional education for schools on this subject.
The educational plan will give greater attention to “real life goals”, including financial mathematics.
The tickets to the Hague will be for tourists at 2,200 rubles.
Since tomorrow, tourists from Bladevestenska in Heahe are starting to drive the court to air raids.
This means additional expenses for those wishing to attend China
The ticket is traditionally much more dangerous than the heat.
As reported in the AmurASSO reference service, the normal ticket value is 2,200 rubles.
The walk through the upper comfort room will be 2,800 rubles.
In fact, the tickets did not travel in this season: the same prices were the same as the tourists and the lower ones, and the year before the summer.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rates are insufficient for State development
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that it is insufficient for RF to increase its GDP and believes that the situation can be improved by simplifying business credit conditions and my Russian economy structure, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned to increase GDP in the 3% area this year, perhaps even more.
It'll actually be less than 2 per cent.
In terms of recession in a number of countries in general, it would not be very bad, but it is a small thing for us, because the economic base is not as strong as it is in a number of countries in general, and in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, receive normal loans at a normal price, this is the first thing that must be done," the head of the Government stressed.

Visit to shores, rivers and jungles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical assistance in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwell and his team carry out almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients.
Not so many doctors in this West African country -- only one per 5,000 people.
Advertise here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwell is one of the 10 major CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 principal heroes to become CNN's hero.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his devoted work.
During the 21st year, George Bwell saw his father come back to life and again fell into a state of unconsciousness, dealing with hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
James Bwelle was injured in an automobile accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only broken arms, but the resulting infection spread to his brain and caused him to think about himself to the end of life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Belle has been accompanying her father in completed hospitals and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they could get.
“ It’s not easy, ” said Bwell.
- You can leave home at 5: 00 a.m. to get to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed significantly since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor per 5,000 people.
In comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor to 413 people.
And even if the cameras could get to the doctor, many of them wouldn't be on the karman.
Two out of five people in that country live in poverty, and nearly three fourths of health costs are private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwell said.
And they cannot enjoy their life because of poverty.
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his relatives, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwell and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a co-operative surgeon at the Yunde Center.
It also established the non-commercial organization ASCOVIME, which organizes visits to rural areas to provide free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and more than 30 people were killed in the suburbs, bound for medical facilities, and traveled to a crowded place to visit those in need of rural assistance.
They're not always successful.
They soon got so many cars through rivers and rivers.
But when they come to them, they meet them, like the people of the cave: this is a festival with songs and dances and better places, which only the locals can offer.
The free medical services in these villages are indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwell, with its wide flavor and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join in the feast.
The next morning the Brigadier began to take hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” said Bwell.
They come all around 60 kilometers from the forest, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-to-day clinics provides various medical services.
Many people receive treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive scholarships, scholarships, or free birth certificates — documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, Brigadiers are performing simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations usually take place in school buildings, municipal buildings or at home; patients then get up and enter the post-operative zone to free the next person.
Using the generator to light up operational and sanitary equipment, Belle and his volunteers worked until early morning morning.
It is a relatively slow pace, but the focus of the Brigadiers is usually helping to support wooden musicians.
"They'll be in the drums all night, so we can rest and keep working," said Bwell.
The members of the Brigadiers are sent back to the city, standing but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those whom they help.
One man explained that his free care operation would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions, the hospital of Belle is also working nights in private medical clinics around Yunde.
This second work, he said, would provide 60 per cent of the financing of his non-commercial organization; the rest would be covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Melli, a medical student at the second degree of Dresell University in Philadelphia, volunteer in the Belle group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to earn money for the organization so that these campaigns can be continued.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Melly, who come from the United States and Europe to join Belle in carrying out his mission, this is an opportunity they would never have had at home.
"We have been given the opportunity to assist in operations where we have helped to remove five blood or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell," O'Melli said.
As a college student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Students of volunteers usually pay their own trip to Cameroon, often coming with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaounde, their food, transportation and training is paid to Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Melli.
He dedicates his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon will never cease.
For Bwell, almost constant load of work is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, fulfilling this promise to their father is a source of great joy to him.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” said Belle.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.
Nouden agreed to give evidence of Merkel's request
The rebel member of Hans-Christian Strebelle met in Moscow with Edward Snoudden.
During the session, the question was discussed whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness to the FRG gender prosecutor in the case of a possible hearing of the German Chancellor's telephone with the US Specialist.
Snouden expressed his willingness to provide the necessary information.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He clearly understood, said Hans Christian Strebel, who knows very much.
Although the National Security Agency led by Kittim Alexander blocked all his movement, Snouden was ready to come to Germany.
However, it began to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, US legislators are beginning to take action in response to a scandal surrounding the US spy programmes.
The Senate Disclosure Committee yesterday approved a bill which introduced additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
In this regard, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Macey, made a statement to journalists at the press conference following a meeting with the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmed Davutoglu, reports BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkey relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this too, so we agreed that the authorities of the Government of the two countries would provide universal support and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade-economic contacts between themselves,” said Vladimir McKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that the 8th regular meeting of the Belarusian-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, resulting in the signing of the Protocol.
The Parties developed a road map of Belarus-Turkey interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Policy Office, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and direction of interaction.
"The protocol of the last meeting is fully implemented, and I am confident that the present protocol will also be implemented, as Belarus and Turkey consider each other as trustworthy partners," he said.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutogla, in turn, reported that the heads of foreign policy offices in the negotiations had decided to continue to develop mutual cooperation and to implement various projects.
The dispute between Belarus and Turkey, the Minister believes, needs to be increased and led to an indicator of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is no capacity in this area.
There has always been a warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will continue to grow and grow.
There will also be all necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama rejects her statement on health
In the midst of the criticism, President Obama went to a Friday about his frequent repeated promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
As hundreds of thousands of people received notice of termination of services from their suppliers, the Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for introducing American society into error.
yesterday Obama made several of his significant public promises.
“Most people with health insurance who work can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to the fact that he called the “renewal of news” on the termination of services, Obama called on those receiving these notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will have the opportunity to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even less than expected.
“You will get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance could be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not conform to new standards required under the access to medical assistance law.
"Let me tell these Americans that you deserve the best," Sibelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who was involved in the implementation of the law on access to medical assistance, said that the launch of the internet sale site was “a terrible evil” since October.
“I am upset and frustrated just like everything,” she said.
- I really want to return your trust."
The expressive Sibelius rejected this phrase, which caught the microphone in front of her assistant at yesterday's hearings in the Chamber after the heated debate with the member of the House of Representatives of Billie Long, the Republic of Missouri, on whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of listening, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the architect of the available medical assistance law had not voluntarily refused from the sponsored government to obtain a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt's agency has lost its status as an unskilled defence media.
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to recognize an invalid licence for the registration of the Rosbalt agency, which is written by Lent.
In the absence of the media status agency, the Roscomsador, for systematic and serious violations of the media law, has been subjected to the arrest of the media.
An unpleasant precedent had been established during the process: the court had considered it possible to close the media and had actually rejected the issue of the right to express objections.
What's Rosbalt?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
Over the years, the agency has opened the second headquarters office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also have missions in the countries of the former SSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as the Federal Information and Analysis Agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of best known private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always carried out a sufficiently specific footnote: the agency's core exclusive publications have been made (and have thus far) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to the strong structures continued throughout the agency ' s existence.
In addition to having a wide base of sources in various departments, Rosbalt spoke on the basis of such proposals and said that Natalya Chaplin, wife of Victor Cherkesov, was the head of the project.
At this point, Chaplin's role in the direction "Rosbalt" to the end is not clear: it is often referred to as "the manager of the project".
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, chief editor-in-Office of the Agency, Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not depicted federal media ratings, either by cititruism or by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the rating of the visit of the Russian media websites on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average audience of the rosbalt.ru site is approximately 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand reviews), about three million unique visitors a month.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months, the comments of Kremlin ' s lack of assistance in relation to Ukraine, the death of the Coral and Shot Solitary Group, were buried in the capital of Birulev.
The Rosbalta conflict with the Roscomnasor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media banning journalists from uncensored defences.
The court found a prohibited lexic in two published video agency sites (Gigit from Krassondar and Pussy Riot discovered oil peaks).
The further sides are described differently.
Rosbalt was charged with the gross and systematic violation of the law on the media on the basis of the discovered videotapes and was brought before the court with a request to select a license agency.
In Rosbalte, the claims of the department were incorrect: first, the roles were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother's words were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the prevention of the roles were removed from the site.
The representatives of the agencies appealed to the Roscomsor in the World Court of Justice - and, when Mosgorsud responded to the Roscomsadsor application on 22 October 2013, the consideration of these complaints continued.
However, 25 world judges have already decided not to benefit from Rosbalta: chief editor Nikolai Ulyanova has recognized the blame for violating the Code on Administrative Offences and has spent 20,000 rubles per 10,000 per role.
Obviously, this has prevented the arrival of a hearing in Mosgorsud - if you give up the idea that the origin could have been denied earlier.
On 31 October, the Court decided to recognize the ineffective evidence of the registration of "Rosbalta" by the media agency.
It can't be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the Gosduma MPs (a statement on behalf of the Heads of the Russian Federation, Alexander Jarova, signed 26 MPs on 10 October; a document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CPRF).
The President of the Russian Federation of Journalists, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Paul Gusev and the President of the Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov, made a statement on the invalidity of the publication.
Furthermore, according to Goddanov, the leadership of the Roscommansor even provided him with some assurances that the case would not be brought to an end.
The Rosbalto Court indicated that the more secure media is available in Russia today is a major issue.
Syria destroyed the weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all the claimed chemical weapons production powers, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of the disarmament of Damascus ended within a day before the deadline set.
As of 1 November, Syria had to destroy the production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combatants for use by Bi-bi-C.
The destruction of own waste stocks or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of WHO, wastes are currently in sealed containers.
International inspectors were sent to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed during the chemical attack on Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemicals - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These productive capacities will now be closely monitored so as not to allow them to do so.
The following wecha is mid-November: by this time ODA and Syria must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing waste stocks.
I've asked a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian declarations will be thoroughly checked by Western intelligence services.
They are ready to consult inspectors with new verification facilities if they are reasonable to suspect that Damascus is not open to the end.
The United States dollars believe that the shooting was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case with the Syrian rebels.
The world community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached with the Russian media, to destroy or introduce all the capacity for the production of gases and liquids and to fill the supply of these substances.
Now that this step has been taken, the next step must be the destruction of the weapons already in the Syrian army.
It is estimated that the arsenal may contain more than 1000 tons of nerve-paral waste, each greenhouse gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several tens of different locations.
For its destruction, it was necessary for the ODA and the Syrian authorities to agree on a schedule of action for the first time - two weeks.
Director of Field Operations of OZHO, Jerry Smith, stated that his inspectors “ personally observed the destruction of equipment”.
"They are now unable to produce further or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The OZHO statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and convinced that the production of goods and waste was either destroyed or brought into disrepute.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out inspection there, but the equipment has been carried out and verified by the ODA specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical infrastructure was “particularly simple” as it was in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but as Smith said, it was time for inspectors to empty it before they found it - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the US spy “has gone very far”
John Kerry demonstrated the ease of the tactical protection of the United States follow-up programmes, acknowledging that, in some cases, the US spy “has gone far away”.
The Secretary also acknowledged that it was responsible, along with Barak Obama, that he had been “in the car” during the gruesome announcements by Edward Snoudene on the ABB spy activity.
These flows have placed the Government of the United States at the center of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Commenting on the video link to the open Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and other members of the Government have, in fact, taken some of the things that have occurred on the highway, because this opportunity has already existed — and during the Second World War, and in very difficult years of cold war, and, of course, 11 September”.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the Government of the United States, who recognized that the US spy had gone too far but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, “In some cases, this has been a very unpleasant thing.
The President of Poland is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain it to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has any sense of abuse.
I assure you that there is no harm done to innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry, however, found that the ABB was working on good incentives and that its follow-up operations saved many lives.
He said, “We are engaged in a new world, where people will come to their senses.
In the world there is radical extremism, unreasonable and full determination to kill people, shoot people and attack governments.
What if you were able to recapture it, to keep it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented the damages of aircraft, buildings and people's killings, because we were able to learn about these plans before".
Meanwhile, American legislators are working in Europe to help resolve the issues related to the alleged spying of the United States abroad and convince Europeans that it is necessary to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, the Vice-President of the Senate on European Affairs said on Thursday.
The Senator from Connecticut Chris Murphy said he had met with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment with the follow-up of the National Security Agency.
“For the sake of national security of the United States, it is essential that Europeans remain our parties to our common counter-terrorism efforts,” said the Merfi democracy, who served as the first-time chairman of the International Relations Committee of the Senate on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I go to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these ABB programmes.”
News that ABB had collected millions of phone calls in Europe had damaged relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were incorrect and reflected the misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and which they had dealt with with with the United States.
Other publications have been published by the Snoudian evidence that ABB has been monitoring the telephone of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel as well as some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, protected spy activities against the allies as necessary and said that it was a common case with both sides.
On the basis of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to Congress members, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the members of both parties and the Chambers would join in the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be drawn up in the next days.
According to him, the travel programme is still in progress.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote improved relations, he said that some degree of “best incentives” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what Spanish programmes they have used themselves for many years.
"While we can change our cohesion programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should be sent to these exits in the Middle East and Poland to address the issue of hostilities with respect to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as to the United States intelligence activities.
The impact of prisoners will be increased in the new compositions of the Public Monitoring Commissions
Today, the Council of the General Assembly (OP) can adopt new compositions of the Public Monitoring Commissions (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option to vote will be adopted, lobbyists will increase their influence.
UNCs are public structures controlling the conditions of deprivation of liberty.
In the case of Sergey Magnetic and Leonida Drosszawa, in the Copy Colon, namely through the UNC, the majority of reasonable events are explained by the solution.
There is a conflict between human rights defenders and lobbyists to control the United Nations.
At the meeting of the Working Group on the Development of the United Nations, I proposed that the experience of human rights activities be selected as a criterion.
"They didn't accept it, they formed lists, they didn't develop criteria," says Valery Borstev.
cargoes, current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, are the comprehensive structure of the human rights defenders involved in prison.
As a member of the House of Lords of Jablok, he has drawn up a law governing the activities of the United Nations.
The OP Council should vote for the composition of the UNC in 43 regions of the country.
In the 1800s, fewer than a thousand volunteers were claimed, but in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balkaria the competition was unable to organize because of the lack of candidates.
OP pledges to organize a meeting at holiday places.
UNC Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, although in the new composition there will be 40 participants.
According to Bortševa, the current composition of the Main Commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 strengths, and the option of voting in the OP, is 17 to 23.
In the capital commission, 30 human rights defenders were sought.
That's why a new composition may be re-entered by the representative of the "Boe's Brothers" Veceslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the United Nations for three years, but he never visited prisoners.
The burden is believed that the forces appointed by their United Nations President will be able to do the work of human rights defenders, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective departure from the commission.
In their view, the movement of force forces is coordinated by a member of UNCAT, Anton Cvetkov, who is the leader of the Russian Officers, an organization that reflects the interests of the authorities.
"I don't have a young man on the track," said the RBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He rejected the promotion of any lists and said that there was no need to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested oppositioners.
According to Vvetkova, he was not even interested in what list now vote in the OP.
It considers the publication of cargo information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the United Nations.
Its former leaders were removed because of the years of copying.
The General Assembly concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
And this is the NGO Rostova-na-Donu that can move from human rights defenders to violence.
One of the new lists of “loss” of the human rights defenders of the local commission was therefore one of his opponents, although in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him from conduct that was not ethical.
The lists of the Moscow and the Borstev Committees are considered to be “a place for Copenhagen”.
The expectations of the Tolokonnik were not affected by the UNC Mordovian, which was considered to be “forced”: in the new composition, only one human rights defender was allowed, and did not even receive the competition documents.
A member of the OP Council, Nikolai Svannide, told CRC daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as it was attenuated by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Paul Gusev said he had voted in favour of the proposed Moscow list.
The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for OP Vladislav Grib, also a member of the FSIN Research Institute, coordinated the preparation of the UNOC lists.
Grib told the CRC daily that he did not consider it proper to apply for human rights defenders and violence and did not agree that the Presidents of the Commission had sufficient authority to stop the work of its members.
Grib will not be required to predict the outcome of the OP Council's vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, there will be a changed option in the next few days.
Australian Women Appeals against Prison Term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 weeks in prison on the island of Phuket for false claims that she had been attacked by a taxi driver and was sentenced to imprisonment and released under bail.
Steve Rochel Bamford was initially recognized by the Phuket provincial court on 15 June in a false claim after the Thai police reported that the local taxi driver had attacked her on the night of the night of 10 June, while two other men had detained her.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had voluntarily returned to her hotel after breaking up her relations with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police asked Bampford for two days before she admitted that she was making this story.
She was held in local police chambers before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-month prison term in the centre of the general prison in Phuketa province, not in the female prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the former game of the Australian League of Peter Tanks, which has been referred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the help of her daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was “deeply concerned” with the welfare of his daughter and hoped her return to Australia.
"Of course it was a time of concern, but we hope that she will be welcome home as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bamford appealed for his sentence and was released at 50,000 bets.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently leaving in the Curtain area of Kraby in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead to the court ' s raising her sentence for two years and allowing her to be released from prison for adults.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian corrigendum Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand, it may also be possible to try to restore its damaged tourist image, which will lead to a justifiable trial.

Roman Sancque is undoubtedly the leader of the generation of current 30-year-old prosthetics.
In practice, each publication of its hard work, based on the modern life of stories and stories, provokes heated controversy among the criticisms of the most diverse directions.
It can be claimed that the collected team of articles on the pros and publications of the Senate, reviews on its books and journals have created a popular and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the early 2010.
In discussions on the production of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to Sergei Cpurin's criticism, most of the words are meant to mean that its participants understand the word “literation” as they see the present and the future not only our words but also our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of books did not allow most of the articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere to be included.
Analytical and review articles are usually given as a reduction in the section "Absada..."
