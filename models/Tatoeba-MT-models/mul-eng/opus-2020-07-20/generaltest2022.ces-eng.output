There's a big return to the Czech symphony.
Pavel Francouz was authorized to NHL
The Czech hockey banker Pavel Francouz, who spends his career in the last months, is returning to NHL.
One-twentieth-year-old platoon will be on the trigger and will soon be able to get to the factory.
The former banker of Lithuania, Plzna or Russian Cheljabinsk was injured in preparation for NHL in October of the year.
In half of his escape with Vegas, he hasn't been represented in the classic NHL since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced banker moved from one track to another.
"Paul Francouz will be outside for about three to four weeks of injury in the lower part of the body," reported the whole of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL branch was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday afternoon, he was allowed to leave the farm where he took four duelas and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he also subscribed 94,5 % in advance.
The reconnaissance of the platoon hockey finally wants to pass and confirm that it belongs to the best league of the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his knees and did not detect a single leak in the short-term pandemic.
In the NHL "France" he dismissed 36 attacks, its success in the steps is 92,3 %.
Charles finds Camille Rousch, William and Kate at the wedding party in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their journey to Jordan as an annual holiday wish.
He also published his request by Prince Charles, who used the photograph on which his uncle Camille was placed on arrivals helps to set up a rose.
On its websites, the British news station BBC reported on this.
They send invitations to friends, colleagues, and employers who work with them.
The photograph came up in the desert.
The guide from Cambridge is dressed in long-year-old jackets in a dress and dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the leader of Cambridge, has the same thing as Prince George and Louis's daughters and shirt with a shirt.
Who ordered the photo, William and Kate didn't show up, it's not even clear when it came up.
Loni's royal family for the photograph, which was designated as a holiday wish, looked on the balconies in front of a wooden cluster in her foreign seat in Norfolk County.
The photo, which serves as a holiday wish, was also published by the successor of Prince Charles's throne with Camillo's wife.
Photographer Sam Hussein was arrested in June on arrivals in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylindrical head and a pink face, helps Camille put her pink in a color-cool with bright clothes.
Slavia, according to the ephotbal.cz, promised Berbro a millionaire for the title, and the Lord did it.
Praha – Criminalists in the current corrupt case had apparently worked with the fact that the former vice-president of the football association ČR Roman Berbr had promised from the Persian Slavian million crown for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server ephotbal.cz of his arrival at the police station.
The president of the summit club, Jaroslav Trudík, said that they had not been allowed to participate in any corrupt conduct.
The server published a record of police officers in which Slavian's former sports director, Jan Nezmar, finished in summer at the master club.
Some of the most influential Reds official was, according to the record, in frequent contact with Berbre, both with the former sports director of the Roman Rogo Square, who is also in the cause among the accused.
Criminals apparently worked with information that Slavia Berbrov promised a financial reward for obtaining a title.
2019 won the SK Slavia Praha title in the first league.
The police authority was aware that for the win in the league, Roman (Berbr) has been awarded the promised million fee by SK Slavia Praha officials, quoted the server from the record.
The day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the president of the Slavie Trudík Presidency.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still keeping this information.
The firm rejected any corrupt conduct.
In 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the measurements in the Czech football and offered an appropriate alternative to its development.
We have never allowed illegal conduct, have not been forced to influence decision-makers in conflict with fair play rules, and have not provided any financial compensation in this context," said the Order for the List of Reports.
In the audiences outside Nezmar does not pick up some former Slavian dark hair players and also speaks to his former head of the fortress.
The cause of the particular impact of the sport by decision-makers has been discussed by the Loney in half of October in several places, including the Prague Sea of FAČR.
The highest in the range is Berbr, which is no longer defined in any of the football features.
In the middle of the winter he was just like the former sports director of Vishehrad Rogoz was released from jail.
Wrestlings, tanks and bvp are larynxed wars.
They'll be new, but in principle a higher type (the shooter must be from a pancaked cabin and carry the goods manually without covering).
Car - Toyoty hi-lux - are new and good
Founders and various panthers vehicles - at the sound level, it has already been possible to escape from Prague V3S and in specialized units.
Flights: combatable, but at the end of the rent, transport - very small with a short flight, but modern.
Drons - small and small types without battle potential
rockets - we don't have any (but we're producing and exporting abroad)
VAT: average - student, adult; short reach - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have stories like that.
I'm right next to town.
There were nosies on the river and made damage to the plants, so I was sitting there.
When I got here, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a brothel, so I sat quietly and the guy didn't see me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something happened, but of course she was gone in a minute.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The weird fisher was bitten, he had his head on all sides, so I called him that it was on his back.
Before I got out of my property was a gun.
And the wolf's got to be a pusser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it's supposed to be a lot of fun to happen, and you'd probably see it in a thermovise that has almost everyone today.
So, in a visible place, dear things, you're going to have to go to bed and you're supposed to be okay.
The military version of Hamáček.
Internal signal of respiratory devices is significantly lower than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of Russians, masks, and respirators for the professions closest to the Coronavir, has issued the crown on their equipment in the past few weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministers and found that during one day the amounts on the respirator were lost to hundreds of crowns.
Why is it so dramatic?
Which authorities were acting economically?
And why did others buy the dragon?
Lenka Kabrel speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas Dominik Kubistov server.
Soldiers and armies are seriously concerned (if I am not covered by memories of the ČSLA which have been distributed by the older generation), but the ČR cannot benefit from the compulsory military service.
We don't even have large funds of techniques that could be mastered by training, we don't actually have modern technology or for existing professionals, and modern technology is increasingly more complex, so the ability of the foundations will be quickly lost in time.
To this modern conventional conflict, where anyone can settle, they will play very fast, there will be no time to rejuvenate someone.
And finally, the bases/territorial defences are of great importance to the country, such as Ukraine, where it is going to carry a mass hierarchy and it is also an expression of the need to frighten the enemy.
In the territory of the ČR, the fight will be fought only in the conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where it will already be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst thing is half of them are playing as if she had it.
So this is the situation that you're watching as a guy who's not going back to the empty gate for 2 minutes, he's going to hit himself between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you're shouting "tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they're gonna beat him like an average tax collector.
This situation with this difference of "probation" is so terrible that I am convinced that I am truly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to defeat one of our opponents.
First characteristics
Cavid's pandemic slows down, however experts do not expect any major return for the following weeks.
The fight in patients according to statistical models will last for some time and has reached a pandemic level, as we know, a new unknown: the variant of omicron, which is likely to spread much faster than in the current control of Delta.
At the same time, you cannot say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious process, as long as it helps to expect or post-infective immunity achieved by previous abuses.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon also occurred on the side of the plus: treatment option.
A new medicine, an antiviral mollupiravir, which reduces the risk of serious illness and associated third-party hospitalization, can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by paxlovide from Pfizer, which reports success to up to 85 percent of the results.
The first supplies of molnupiravir to Česca, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools used in the fight against coronavir pandemic, also raised the question of how the future medicines are prepared by the local administration.
As has been said, the first to receive molnupiravir from Merck will be obtained in the Turkish patients.
The company ended up on foot as the first and because it started to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with a view to finding an appropriate treatment for viral horse disease on the South American continent.
In this research it is often mentioned that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their views.
That's why Eastern Europe, and especially the Czechs, is used to speaking "as a child's eye."
You're going to do a research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In Czech, most people will tell you no.
In the West they'll tell you how they like migrants, how they should all help them, and how we're a racist mob.
And then they go and love parties like AfD.
They're afraid of canceling culture, saying this to the public means losing work and the media line.
Then it looks beautiful, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people think.
It's only in France, Le Penov and Zemmoura, both have a study of more than 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and quite identical in Czech.
For the same reason that soldiers don't want to learn where they are again, all objects on the team are the same.
One is Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The scandal is that the sire did not want to have its own nuclear head on its own territory, either because of safety or the speed of head arrest because of the more favorable position.
In these underground covers (in each row there are two) only the heads of not all rockets as they are called.
If this weapon had to be installed, a special unit, which lifted this head and mounted on some of the wearer devices, came in.
In addition to the museum hall, the remains are in a remote state.
At the second level of basic school, we had Cigana's partner, four years old, and we were with him.
He was all right, he was doing good plugs, he's been doing a lot of good, but he was kind of our mask.
He had a conversation with him every time he walked around and wanted to explain something, missed a bit, walked around regularly, got involved in sports with us, didn't steal the candles, or the phone, walked clean away.
He even went to school in the field, made various opiums, but he was fine, he never had any time.
In the eighth or ninth class, relatives, cigarettes into the same year, other classes.
Shortly after that, the teacher got angry, the police often solved something, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sell something to an intern (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I've been selling more and more to the Cigans, the money always had, didn't try to attract me to the price, communication in peace.
I even sold this car, and a guy in a month called it over.
I'm saying I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or other, while he's acting the way he does in a good society (work, functions, women don't fear, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, puts his hand out, destroys the apartment and houses, he's just having a mess around him, he's doing problems... he's just like his color, but he's gonna be fine.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they start with us, start to work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English) and respect our culture.
If they believe in God, it's one thing for me until they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be there too.
A young woman died in a car accident at Prachaticku
“The young woman suffered serious numerous injuries, and despite her resurrection care, she was saddened by her on-site injuries,” said Zuzan Fajtlová, a lawyer of South-South health defenders.
Havari's probably indicted the driver who took the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot brand was probably headed from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for some undiscovered reasons he was under attack.
After the battle, Škodo Octavia finished the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside of the vehicle, signed an accident by the Yugoslav police officer Štépánka Schwarz.
The young driver Peugat suffered a very serious injury when the accident occurred.
There was a lot of damage and he was stuck in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute hospital care, and in a stable condition he was transported to the Czech Republic hospital, found the savior Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered a mild wound to the brain and was transferred to the hospital.
For packages outside the EU, new rules are paid, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
It's mostly collecting cards.
"Of course, it can be ten dollars, we should say from ten dollars up where it will still be paid, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, he has been conducting a series of small amounts of money, he has to start a new DPH and send data to the customs office.
He's coming by e-mail and I'll tell him the customsmen are waiting for the package to come.
Then it will be sufficient to complete the deposit and if DPH does not include the dealer at the sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount of the deposit and transport.
In the event that the address does not provide the customs office itself, the fee of the carrier must also be paid to the whole part.
According to Luke Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click on one or two stickers, I'll put in two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's mostly a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
Not all snacks, but they can get cold.
Because of the new customs rules, the number of asylums received from foreign countries from 60 thousand to 15 thousand was posted at international mail in Prague.
According to Czech mail, the problem is also that people do not respond to the requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30 thousand backups on the international mail that we need to work on.
If people filled all the data they need and filled it in time, then we would be half a bunch here, says Czech mail Matäš Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose solutions to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% inflation and its next growth is expected.
What do you think he should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see a need in Poland to reduce DPH on food and PHP, is this your way?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable about where it's going?
Prices rise faster than wages, I believe it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much do you have to add (who's an employee)?
I've been added 2% this year to the grave, which is ridiculous, but I'm happy to have a similar income from the company I work with.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the evidence of rape is being sent to the network for only six months?
This head just doesn't matter how the court can send an animal out for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months are nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships altogether.
And it's not that the victim of rape must never remember it again.
Does he not do this even potential future reports of rape victims?
A man from Hrobu "provalil" his friend from Kostomlat
The man from Croatia did not want to help the guards to ensure his full-fledged friend from Kostimlat who was ordered to arrest.
He called her himself.
He's been doing it all the time.
First of all, he spoke to the conquistadore, and he thought the story was stolen.
After calling on the press line, the guards reached the site and were not surprised when a certain “crazed” officer told them that he had designed everything to get the guards to take the place.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the guards how to report to the CR Police.
In checking the identity of the husband and his friend, the guards found that the woman was on the list of the persons sought, in the entire country, and was ordered to arrest her.
That's why the case is resolved by the CRC.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slovenian?
I personally feel that we are no longer ethnic or cultural, but I would be interested in you.
On the other hand, I would naturally agree with the fact that the Church has failed to ensure the release of Prahy USA :')
Of course I don't say we have the Slovak language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really trust anything without proof just because it could be potentially beneficial.
I wouldn't think of such a case personally for true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's a clue in the world, if I don't get involved, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should man choose?
I would say that it is likely that in some of these thousands of religions there is at least one god who does not bother you, if you will believe in another god.
Yet, there is no god other than Jehovah.
So in such a case, would it not be more reasonable to maintain faith in any god than to risk that one of these thousands of gods would choose wrong and one true god that I did not deserve, send me to hell or some other place like this?
Other: Voluntary training with the following booking classification.
The Swiss model is quite similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a taste of the offer.
I'm putting all the AQRs on something like this.
It would be possible to do this in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the educational sector and industry, the fishing companies in schools, and some divergence when the labour force migrates from the educational institutions to the labour market.
Not only when growing up, but this process continues, each of us continues to learn something new, from one range to another.
Similar distortions should also operate between the civil and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between the city and the army, so the institution that promises never to enter Russia, Germany, or need a Mongolian passenger.
It's funny how you think NATO is about something thrown into the rock, we're connected, and you're gonna protect us when it comes to time.
Well, you're having a baby.
There's one election in the United States that's going to cover their budget and NATO's entire going to the pier.
The English will replace us for Russian money, the Germans will replace us for Russian oil and Polish once again show them enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that long-term serves as a guarantee of independence is an armed army and a citizen who can control military technology in his time.
And today he's able to fly far-controlled means of every teenager, so it wouldn't happen.
We don't need border reconnaissance, it's a shame today, but the playing teenager behind the button of a remote control device is getting better.
How to not inject in cancer cells
Will you rent gifts under the summer tree and at the same time be at home with cramps and fillings?
This waste is again used by e-shops where cargo materials are missing.
That's why it turned out to be a business map that welcomes your use of cookies.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All coastal materials are proposed to maintain a restored manipulation.
That's why it's damage to them as a single waste.
Anyone can bring to the related trade after agreement (map of the KAMSNIM.cz project is free of charge 150) cartons, plastics or paperboards.
It supports small companies, reduces the amount of waste created and also avoids overloaded blue containers.
Self-trafficking goods currently lacking in the market and also saved because the freight card for the last period amounted to 50 %.
In the eyes of ecologically thinking customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such trade is TIERRA VERDE, the producer of eco-drugs and cosmetics.
The crew and the delivery material to Popovek in Brna are carried by individuals who are gathered at home, however, also called us by companies, with whom we have agreed regular shipments of left-hand cartons.
We'll use everything when we pack our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a better world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušník, from Thierry.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz, however, shows not only the places on the packaging.
It serves as a searcher, if you need to save anything (where to remove the stolen waste from your home, where to remove previous medicines, pneumatics, powered power, battery, light source, large-scale waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and more renewables will find their second home.
The whole project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
“In progress, the halls, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charitable offices, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise otherwise have become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the Uklýma Česko app.
I think it's wrong for me to think that today's technology is so simple and bluffy that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, the problem (mainly in English articles) has been revealed that high school students do not understand the principle of computers.
Because Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or actually mobile phones usually simply hide this sublinging file system with components and everything begins on one of the screens in the application.
It's nice to use the technique from childhood, but mainly to learn something.
Let's write the events, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – beginning in January – and this was huge.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he left the presidency logo, called for European protection – at work, on the street – and mentioned so much action that they could not be reached in half a year.
French politicians like it, but they like it and they like it.
Macron's supporters of the crossing between the right and the left agree on a small, but right on Europe.
And in France, they'll be in the dark of the new election of the head of state.
A voluntary calendar has also influenced priorities.
In addition, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one European event" and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators have responded immediately to the criticism that Macron is talking about a pro-European propaganda and recording history.
In fact, more efforts are being made to prevent this from happening.
The country's legal candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is currently in charge of France with the fact that the Vichy regime, which was working with Hitler during the second world war, was not so bad, and has quite a success with it in France.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one of the teachers of literature seriously, and don't look for action in France.
Wouldn't she need it?
Students in European countries learn a lot about history as a story of our version of them and never as a story of the whole.
Spanish, French, Czechs know who's wounded in the battle.
But if they don't have a lighting office, they won't know what the wider context of the event was.
What are you doing, Aida?
The Czech Mouse won't win.
The experience of returning to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 also received an evaluation for the regime and for the best heretic Jasnu Durić.
At the annual Karlova festival, he stood on the first steps of a wild rabbit.
The best leader in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not very healthy and I'm not expected.
It was like "to have a spade/be bitten" a couple of days I had to go and I didn't really want to burn...
On the contrary, it was worse than the usual scratch.
I don't have a clue in my throat.
I'm not saying it's just personal experience.
Night Book Types
The weekly doubles issued on 20 December will contain a traditional literary annex.
And with her, there's also cultural types.
The bookkeepers, we're adding you to this digital issue, so that you'll have enough time to book as a holiday gift, if any.

Trains are starting to run according to a new train order, where transport is changing
From Sunday they start riding on the train according to the new train order.
The biggest change is the exchange of transporters on some tracks, for example between the mouth of the Labe and the Colin, where the place of Czech dragons begins to ride RegioJet.
In most of the line, the time of departure is only adjusted, in a relatively mild manner and their route.
Tens of new trains will be on the way.
With the sale of the train, the transporters started in the winter.
In the new railway line, the Czech dragons plan to prepare daily for 6783 personal transport connections, from which there will be 478 remote trains per day.
Trains will catch within a new train line of some 118 million miles.
In addition to the national connections within the new railway line, the dragons will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Hungary, Rakouska and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new railway line, will set up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will be on the lines from Prague to Chebu.
Other new trains are being repaired in northern Moravia or in western Czechia.
Transporters have also traditionally increased traffic prices since next year, with an average of 3.2 per cent.
The dragons look at inflation in their tariffs every year.
The largest change in the RegioJet railway line is on line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mälník – Nymburk – Kolin.
The transporters here, after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, are rewarded by the Czech Drakh.
Each day, RegioJet will complete 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Further changes are related to the remote connections between Prague and Brne, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havlíčk's Ship, Zážar nad Sázavow and Kolín stations.
Leo Express kept his 16 connections, two back connections in Slovenia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emila Sederík, the transporter has also tried to save the most similar travel times of his long train.
Without major changes, it should also continue to carry out trains for Arivy and other carriers.
Transporters will also be replaced in some regional routes.
The changes await, for example, traveling to Českolopsk, where on the road from Young Boleslav via Česko Lípu to Rumburk will be the place of Czech dragons to ride the Trilex train of the German company Die Länderbahn.
Travellers will also be able to use a single train on a train in the second year.
As in the Czech Republic, their price is higher than that of inflation by 3.2 per cent.
I don't have to agree.
Can't we learn to look at the other side?
We all hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they had to be pressed and touched, they died.
I haven't heard a lesson in my life from a child's side or from that time on, no one's gonna say it, just cancel it.
No one will tell you at school that black people often sell to babies themselves black and that they were often the worst kids.
No one at school teaches you that colonists often bought land from Indians, they're just telling you how brutally we, Europeans, have been killed, and they've been killing each other for a long time.
I spent some time in the United States, right at schools, in both northern and southern schools.
I didn't agree with the fact that someone would deliberately hide the fact, but I've heard before that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't agree with it (that in Japan, the WW2 plant is quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to dismiss things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this.
Despite the fact that we are already in these southern states, yes, the confederate flag and the famous children there are quite popular, on the other hand, and they had some good success and I came to hate them.
In addition, the North wasn't much better than it's been idealized by a lot of people today.
And many people also forget that not all of Judah were children and that there was a lot of opposition.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, they deliberately ignore some facts, lie and manipulate, and we don't have to look at them (there was a video on the YT, where someone started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What happened to me at U.S. schools was funny the rise of Marxism and idealizing communism, something that never happened to their country.
I've come to realize that at some universities it was clear, that the students were quite radicalized and that the schools supported them several times.
And when I imagine these people will once be a lot older, it's a little bad for me to be most of them, because it's between the young and the ruling elite.
I'm told that he must've achieved what he had for a long time, and that's not about him anymore, he's become radicalized.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT and lead to radicalization and on the opposite side, when it often leads to opposition and even to very reasonable things.
The more someone is radical, the more they hear him.
Anyway, at the end of the day, I also didn't agree that someone would take me for colonialism or childhood.
I just met with the wrong country, but it was weird:D.
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely meaningless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition to the concept of nationality, I fully consider it to be a remnant of some personal identity.
If there's any interest in me with people like this, watching the world and sharing experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic practice here, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovenian.
This Slovenian hero is a very nice guy, he's got to talk more about theology than politics, but he always fucks some cocotonine about the coronavir that everybody is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there's the Church of the Czech Slavic Husits.
They're actually Protestants, but they're actually born with Catholic moderns and they're actually Catholics without papers.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they're going to worship the gods, because it's a lot like theology, but the members are mostly liberal.
They have beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michal in the Dominican province belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 we do our Latin, as did before Vatican II.
The flame from Betéma is in Czech, to be taken from Rakouska
Bréclav – Plamínek, celebrated in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
He was taken to the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing by his Raquel colleagues, but not this time they did not go to Vídá.
She was taken to the border.
The Belgian light is a beautiful holiday tradition that we share with each other every year, I am delighted to do so.
It's an honor for me to have been elected, told the local journalists about the cover of Amalie Buddík.
While the transfer took place on the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, which is right on the border bridge, now on the crossing of Reintal – Breclav on the parking lot.
Usually for him, he's driving a train to Vienna.
Nothing changes in the production of the flame after the Czech Republic.
With the light of Belgium, they have been traditionally injured by train first to Brna, where they transmit it to the Diocese Bishop of the War Ciclès.
On Saturday, 18 December, the next light is set up by the curators who will travel by chosen speeds and personal trains.
From them, light will be transferred to local stations or volunteers, who will continue to spread the flame in Czech and beyond.
This year also has to be affected by the enforcement of measures against the spread of coronavir.
It's like a lion.
We recommend to both the Kurdish teams, the organizers of local actions, of course, to carry Russians, to keep their divorces, to be at least, not to sing fellows, just to act like it's the most dangerous, to describe the speech actions of the Belgian light Zuzana Hrbkov.
The tradition of Belgium’s light, which travels to Europe, was born in 1986 in Raków.
The aim is to spread beyond the flame of the thought of peace, friendship and peace.
The light of Bethlehem is for a faithful symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In Czech, he's been making an effort to hurt and scratch for more than 30 years.
The actions are based on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of uncertainty and human interaction.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come to the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvello.cz.
I have no economic education, so I don't know the foundations of the economy that confirm that the grant is an economic loan, but I don't think the grant would be a problem as a whole.
The development of infrastructure, the environment(e.g. water conservation), health and education is properly used, although I do not understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and the whole company.
As mentioned, it produces the remaining product and acquires the free market and "the dedicated life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of "xy-financed/solden-funded projects" and such a company is just art kept alive.
This doesn't support the company that gives work to x people, this is the speeding up of development when this company acts as it does and collects orders/employers with companies that could grow and become more productive after its release.
It's a simple agreement, it's dangerous.
Sometimes even the person who was born online is also caught in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think the Internet ads are bothering me, but then I'm trying to make sure that they're affecting me - it's just so tempting that people don't always kill me.
That is why I support the radical vote in the European Parliament, which currently want to ban the programme (= targeted) advertising...
It's all nonsense, classical words - I'd like to ban these internets.
I'm feeling from this virus has roots in (but mainly in paragraph 1):
1. "I won't believe anything that most believe and makes sense, I'm not like sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'm going to say it's critical thinking."
2. "I will not believe everything they say media"
3. "I don't believe in politics"
TVs lost the trend of evening movies, their prime minister has two percent this year
Los Angeles – China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English speaking countries have lost the trend of Christmas films and their fans in the prime show more than two hundred a year.
This was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The generation of holiday family and romantic films in recent years in the public is markedly increasing follow-up, which is why these images are becoming more and more popular.
This year, four times more Christmas films than in 2011 and two times more than five years ago.
The IMDb database also included only those photos that have the word Christmas (Vánoce) in their name, so it will actually be a lot more Christmas movies.
Films that have traditionally been associated with Christmas have always existed.
In Czech with this period there are special events, worldwide there is also a popular need for pictures Home, Love heavenly or classic Christmas story Life has been beautiful since 1946.
The right photo boom, but started until 2009, when the special film series came to the American cable station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her adventure project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station has started its wonders at Vánoce to be loaded on October 22nd and will present 42 images of the night.
The Lifetime Competition Station has this year a programme of 35 new films with evening themes and a full account of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
"In this turbulent period of history it is not so much relevant that it is important that there are a number of summer streams in the background and that it snows," wrote Colonel Brandon Gray, author of the book of Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For wonders, it is a form of isolation and a way of at least two hours to feel a little calm between all the religious madness and the madness of the world in which we live in the last few years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark's TV is still using the same recipe for his films, which is quite uniform but successful.
You have two people who love each other, but then it'll be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that's going to work out, and they're gonna love each other.
That's what it's always done, and as long as all movies look like and have the same atmosphere, people follow each other, adds Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, which did not fit into the final F1 race.
To the great price of Abū Killing in formula 1 there are only ninety drivers.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and did not fit into the final race of the season.
Wait, Haas, just one formula.
In the last race of the season, he had to attack on a better location from the 20th floor, which he qualified.
The Russian Nikita Mazepin from the state of Haas, however, will not end up at the Grand Price of Abū Death.
He was also positively tested on code-19.
In the initial growth, only 19 vehicles appear, from the last story appeared on the track of Mick Schumacher's teammate, from the first Max Verstappen, who deals directly with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepine is indicated by the state of Haas relatively well and does not show any signs.
Nikita's physically fine because he was as sympathetic.
It is now in isolation and will guide the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, while security will be the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," said its representatives for formula1.com.
They don't go to Haas's rehearsal race, they can't even go to the race.
The relevant refunder should also complete the qualification or driving in another part of the weekend.
With a man-19, he doesn't have the first racer.
At the start of the final season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, the loni were positively tested by Sergio Pérez cz Lewis Hamilton.
They can shut you down for this too.

From the point of view of the law, a person is on a list of alleged disabilities.
So in the same group as HIV, sea, yellow, or typhus.

In the United States, there are a number of new cases of police violence, which are currently under way in the context of national protests.

Poland officially requested NATO State aid, and in relation to several months of the ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime, which, in its territory, has led the citizens of neighbouring countries to a false approach to the easy crossing of the Union border.
In Poland, British and Estonian soldiers are already on the move.
The Omicron mutation spread south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking another case of Adam's kid.
"We are currently reporting further suspects of this variant of another Adam's child, from the preparatory class.
The direct contact with previous cases of the ZS Adamov has not been demonstrated," Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the country during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for the Grip and Non-Crescent Resources of the State Health Institution in Prague," the director said.
She added that it was about two healthy sisters from one of the faculty hospital Brno and two children one of them, another two one-year-old JS Adamov petitions.
There is no connection between Brna and Adam's cases.
Three of them, according to the director, have a good sign, four non-significant procedures.
No one had any suspicions about Omicron traveling abroad.
None of these had to travel abroad, nor any of their families, nor had any contact with anyone who would have stayed abroad.
Consistency with the champion in the water field is not in any of the above mentioned, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienic, Paul Svrčín, indicated earlier that an international tour was being conducted in the water pool that was in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player was ill after his return.
California limits the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas when he's under arrest.
On Saturday, Governor of California Gavin News announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in his controversial law against the shipments carried out after the heart attack.
People would then have an advantage over any person who manufactures or sells or sells explosive rifles in California and a home made of firearms.
Newsom's notice responded to the U.S. Supreme Court's petition, which had left a text ban on passports available to cover almost 50 years of the previous currency, which had the right to travel across the United States by 24 months of pregnancy.
The Court has not yet decided on the existence of the whole law, but on a technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The exemption of the ban was also transferred to the public in this case, where the Czech Republic did not allow its attack on the normal court way.
"I have been condemned yesterday by the Supreme Court of the United States of America, which has permitted the maintenance of the Texas ban on most of the services and has, to a great extent, supported the Texas Manager with a view to protecting his law," said the California Governor.
"If States can now block their laws from federal courts, then California will use this right to protect human lives," continues News.
First, he believed that in cooperation with the State Parliament and the ministers of justice, he would work on measures that would correct the representatives of the public to avoid the ban on attacks and such weapons of the spirits.
These are identified in the home for weapons which do not have serial numbers and which can serve to carry out the regulation.
Newsom wants them to have the right to demand at least $10,000 (more than $220,000) for "citizens" and court charges from anyone who would produce, distribute, sell or sell explosive rifles, participates in "arming spirits" or seeds for their production.
"If the most effective way of keeping these terrible weapons out of our streets is to create a threat of private complaints, then we should do so exactly," said the California Governor.
The AP Agency notes that after ten years California banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, in June, but the federal court further banned the ban as anti-smokers.
Although the state would now indeed prohibit the use of the Texas template, the words of the liberal members of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, which, in a non-conformity opinion, protected the flag State against the extension of the given legal mechanism to other States.
The Supreme Court, however, refused to grant full immunity to the trial and allowed the performing clinics to continue in complaints against the chosen factor in the southern United States.
Each emergency expectation has its public test phase when it comes gradually to how the waiting scheme will look and also to improve the vaccines on the basis of results.
It should be from Israel in a large range of studies on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients are up to fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect on you.
Just like every other expectation will in time have its expected scheme, it's just too fast to do it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should soon be marketed on the basis of an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specification, has a greater effect of up to 10x.

How can I legally follow the League of Masters online?

I think O2 offers the League of Masters, but I don't want to change the provider of television and the Internet.
Poland to suspend payment to the Union budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would argue with the law if it used new powers and stopped the payment of Polish money due to the dispute on the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the withdrawal of EUR 36 billion from the Union fund for the recovery of the savings of the covid-19 pandemics.
It is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move forward and to use the mechanism that enables countries to adopt a Union grant in violation of the principles of the rule of law.
"Police should respond to this call from the EU but in all matters requiring uniformity," said Ziobro, head of the small side of Solidar Poland, without which the current government would come to a close majority in Seym.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policies leading to a dramatic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will request that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable in view of the fact that the EU is disclosing funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing, by the Polish Minister.
Its approach to the EU involves a more radical existence than that of the ruling party in law and justice.
According to the European Commission, changes that have been made by the Polish court for Ziobro's actions threaten its independence and undermines its policies.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, is “a condition impossible because its objective is not a legal state but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw's head is "political dictatorship by drawing up and trying to support the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of the EU which is based on the partnership of sovereign states rather than on the government of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his side would never belong to Brussels as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
"We will never agree to have the status of the Polish colony," he declared.
But to be recognized in this... we have one sort of cheese in four different places in Lidla.
I did some research on other things, one yogurt I met again and again, I needed only cheese, parmagnat, after ten minutes in milk rule, I refused and asked myself.
They had him, it's true, in this rough sector all were chosen, less ordinary and special cheeses, but it was between green and non-lactose zone...
If it's going to be avoided, I'm not going to stay in any market anymore, action of non-actions, gold instead of the place, they don't have to have such a choice, but most of them have everything I need and they have some order, so I've got ten minutes ready.
To Lidla, I'll take it easy.
And it's all one for me.
For two years, I've been monitoring how data is stored here like an oven, most of the expectations are just a little bit out of the table than most of the expectations.
A rational discussion takes place at a professional level, but only extreme views are reached in the public area.
It's still coming to the wall.
Binary considerations: waiting saves us, expecting is nothing.
To order everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparison of apples with vegetables.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But the method of data collection is that no one is able to solve the difference in these two states.
Fuj, I've got it.
Sorry to interrupt and miss you all.
When I was a child, I was tortured by a witch.
It was never because of signs, mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and broke (I read instead of going to sleep, slept with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never distracted without warning, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get the wound (sometimes even after the "pressure" of the fire only brought and put it so that I could see it).
The first time I refused to listen again, I got a couple of mornings on the back (bedding).
I personally think that physical punishments (in reasonable exercise and measures) are beneficial because a child reacts much more than words.
I believe that this part of caution is important because it gives the child his choice whether he will listen or get better or not and will not be punished.
In the end, most of me was just warning me to start listening.
System Tools
When the important Czech lawyer and the Constitutional Court of the Cepl in 1999 answered a press question for him, the Czech Constitution, whether a sacred letter, which is a pledge to be made at school, or an agreement that may be changed if necessary, was firmly committed to the first meal.
Once we have agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as state and its citizens, and with the changes it is better to pursue.
And imagine that some nations have their rules even to their own.
Just like Cheši's favorite witch and wild, he has now voted on the question of the Soldiers of the Cepl.
In recent times, however, it has become increasingly evident among lawyers that the CR Constitution needs to be amended.
The year has been tested by situations that her cousins (to whom the Voyès Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example by acting directly by the elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents shows that political compromises in their texts must be reflected.
The constitution should be understood and actively protected, only then can be the key to resolving most of the crises facing companies.
The Constitution is in addition to any other rule that consists of individual rules that set out for policymakers in the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we agree with the policy.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exert their power.
Covid doesn't choose, FN Brno fights for the lives of a couple of months' baby girls.
Even though it is known that coronavirus is more peaceful with children, serious cases have occurred especially in recent times.
"We know that children are threatened and infected less than adults, talking about 2 to 5 per cent compared to adults," said the Newinka primary clinic of Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation School of Brno and Medical College of the University of Petr Dominic.
Experience is much easier, easier, often with no gifts.
But there are children patients who are with coronary disease, which we see especially in the last period," Dominic added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need peaceful care.
This is reflected in the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Indeed, very very sick children with coronavir are in the last days on ARU.
Children with postcovidic syndromes were continually separated by doctors throughout the year.
"Now it is the growth of children with acute bovine pneumonia, which means the fungi that require a stay on the resurrection bed," he said and added that this disease is infecting adults, both adolescents and several months of childhood.
In hospitals, children are also exposed to severe conditions due to coronavir.
"At the present time, we have a child of several months and a teenager," said the prime minister.
She is also glad that at the FN Brno Children's Hospital they have not yet reported any child's death.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the PRC on 6 December.
According to Dominica, in the child hospital – not just in the coronavir department – is a non-participating part of psychology cooperation.
It also cautions against the fact that, as with adults and children, it slows down the cycle of disability and at the same time lowers the demand for postcovigilance syndrome.
"That is why we recommend the application of the expected dose for children," the doctor added.
You can only walk in the quiet zone.
But those quiet zones aren't so big.
They're seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
You can usually walk anywhere (but not across the platform).
You must not lie/go on the train in the woods outside the marked road unless you have an exception (but of course you do not look so far outside the national park).
How's the flower manager?
The song goes into my head, laughs at Josef Kurfirt.
He's fired by the liberal opium and originally played on the forest floor.
As a singer, he can sing practically all the repertoire and as a director not only in the liberarian Divadle F. Šaldy, but also in Plzni, in the divatle Joseph Kajetana Tyla.
He's working with rough Philharmonic, film phylharmonic, or a sub-krononic symphonic orchestra.
China is building an understanding of the conditions under which the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building an understanding of the laws governing the crisis and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis.
China has been exposed to health and political offenses.
A few months ago, Beijing was critical of not being able to stop the ban that has changed in the global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in the target.
The Czech States, including the Czech Republic, agree on Chinese protection aids and many Chinese doctors help in the battle with coronavir, for example in Italy.

A nice friend of mine says, "Hey, you don't want a elephant?"
I got him and he's gay.
The wife likes it because she's saving the grass, the car washes, the kids play with it.
Well, it's just advice.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you the elephant.
Kamarad: I'm crying, it's gonna be a deal...
After a while, they meet and what he bought complains about: you love what you sold for the elephant?????
He's a drunk, he's lying all over the place, he's got a car sitting around, the kids are afraid of him, and the wife wants to let him grow up.
What he sold says: you're not talking about sloons, you're not selling sloons like this...
The world's actions are dominated by great powers.
Although it pays for the equality of sovereign states, it is very powerful, which determine the course of international action.
Europe can only become so powerful if it is working on its integration.
This still works at the level of economic and political (in selected issues), but it still lacks military integration.
I personally think that Europe is headed for federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, there's gonna be someone else's in charge and they'll do it.
I thought so too, and it's possible.
I'm not an expert at the party, so maybe I'm a dictionary.
I'm just saying that the ellipse mostly includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will draw an example from another commenter "Spanish measuring and mandarins", when it is clear that one is concerned about Spain, which in the "Spanish fruit and mandarins" is no longer clear in the Mandarin that they are from Spain.
In addition, I believe that the wind sounds "all American forces" and including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are only defenses of Americans.
In other words, I therefore expect it to be included in this broad concept and it is no longer necessary to specify it in American forces.
But again, I just need a dictionary :D
Whether it's true or not, it's an unreasonable request
In Tokyo, earthquakes of the strength of five levels were recorded.
The Japanese Metro Tokyo and the surrounding area were hit by a 5.0 degree earthquake on Sunday.
The Witnesses indicated that in the main city, buildings had been damaged, no damage, but not yet reported.
No warning has been issued against tsunamis, informing the Reuters agency.
Vicki Holland from Britain suffered from the nightmare of the cosmos Milly
The amazing sights show the moment when the frightened birds were baptized in the spring before her invisible owner cried and laughed at her.
The Dutch oyster also fed bags, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual survival needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwento has now ordered her to act alive, informing the newspaper The Sun.
The officers of the rehabilitating opiate who are looking after Milly after her arrest said they've never seen such a scared spaceman before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating the Monkey World workers in Dorset and now playing peacefully again with another saved child named Moon.
The four-year-old mother admitted to two charges of causing the rest of the animal's suffering.
She was sentenced to one year's imprisonment in the Magistrate Court of Gwento.
The Netherlands was also assessed at 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-long order for animal behavior and had to pay a total of 12,000 court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly stayed before you got used to people again.
She got baptized and hid in front of everyone she met, and whatever loud sound or sudden movement got her to cry.
The cook refused for a long time to eat.
And now, when she's alone and she's alone, she can still cause panic about new people.
Psychiatric languages from the team will always carry out her, offering Sawyer.
Milly's arrest came suddenly after the police in Gwent revealed terrible arrests on the woman's phone after she was wounded in her apartment because of drug charges.
You can hear Milly volunteer.
In the next video, you can hear the Dutch drunk offering cocaine and say, "Do you want cocaine?"
I'm gonna have my olives.
In May, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), she agreed to hold cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the count of fewer than 50,000 kroner) hidden in the Kinder ovarians.
Cox was subsequently arrested for 30 months, and Holland received a fine of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts do you learn from this rule three times after you cross the 20th century?
Why don't you take the same thing first as the sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killing the idea of bifling when anyone, honor, exception, doesn't care if you can or understand it.
Mostly write the test on 1 and then no one's interested in it anymore.
The question is whether to determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients on the street.
They've all been through this, and the absolute majority aren't even deaf, and they'll tell you they've got a drink.
So, what the fuck is that supposed to be?
I'm a great fan of public opinion and the reality is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that moment, it's very serious, and you'll never get it at all.
In part, it's learned for a lot of people who need something here.
But like, this note that you don't need all this facts on the machine because you just don't.
Moreover, we gradually get to the time when we don't know the sign of the note.
(In what we are most likely to share our communist past and revenge against educators and elites) The whole price of being in these machines is just high.
If journalists should be able to count, the person here would probably never get these dimensions.
The wedding at first glance: The Kadriho and Andrey continue!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave immediately," Andrea responded to an instagram in Stories on all the questions of science fiction, which she complained at Kadrim so she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Kadri and Andrew have been covering this since the start of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and that his idea was that Andrea was moving after her, so at least until she was back in Czech.
That's exactly what she refused.
And as you can see, not only did he not end up in love but he grew up in a mutual hatred and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! turned to Kadri in response to Andreino's charge of lying, gambling and debts.
The honest honesty of Kadri now did not even like his younger sister Linde's ex-wife.
This brother decided to take over.
I don't normally express myself to such a thing, and we never said anything extra in the family.
I don't want to make you feel sorry for yourself.
But when I see someone who's trying to get in public and get in the name of someone I love so much, I just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this trip, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri publicly for making a character from himself and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I'm more sorry when I have to read such false information that are probably quite out of context.
I would love to know Kadri, like me, our relatives and family, who are in a position to respond to Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but most importantly, that we, his family, love him and know the truth and know how it really came to be.
The drunk thief drowned after the phase into the fifth floor.
You don't believe what.
Cchao started his professional training at the parking lot in the residential district where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the information available at the end of one vehicle, he printed a total of 330 kroner.
Then there was nothing better than spitting into floor 5 and entering the apartment with open window.
There he stole two bananas.
At the reception of one security camera is then caught as he goes off the street away from the scene and the banana is eating.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
The next Chaa kept it.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on an incriminating day.
And given that he needed money, he decided to steal in the pit.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The opulent ran out after the phase to the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.

On Monday, the elections will be held by the National Electoral Commission.
Then they'll be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
I think you know all this stuff that people here write.
You're just playing dumb so you're supposed to be with the guy.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerate or anything like that.
I even liked a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic view (which was finally meant to look good).
And I don't care who believes in it.
On the other hand, I see how much the church had in the middle of her life, how much money she had saved, the pursuit of science, etc.
It's not about all the wars she's done, for example, that thirty-year-old.
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaghetti monster, but state and church have no collectives to do
The man fell head down from 12 meters.
He survived the concrete scene.
An incredible flood survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, where the rescuers of the National Health Service were busy.
Workers at the National Operating Centre transferred an hour after Saturday afternoon's press call with initial information on men's fall from heights.
In place immediately, two teams of ZZS – medical and medical.
Upon arrival, the doctors found out that a 17-year-old man had to fall out of a window about 30 feet [12 m] high and hit his head on concrete!
In the Vitkowices, there's a coal mine.
But not as it should have been, and they went to work.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct life-threatening.
The incinerator incinerated his breathing route, secured the art of ventilating ventilating and after other measures in the prenatal care of her sanitization vehicle transferred to another care of the Australian Traumatological Center, informing ZZS MS country spokesman Lukáš Humpl.
More concerns than Coronavir I have from inadequate public reactions and authorities
Coronavir screening in Czech means a challenge for politicians and officials, first of all, to fight the ban, but above all, they are the medical and medical personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes after seven years of fall, Oliveira has been hunting the dog
The MMA has experienced a parallel glove full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 tournament is doing the same thing.
The Austrian Juliana Pennow managed to defeat the legendary band of Amanda Nunez, who had not found the winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't make it easy, presented a great scream against Dustin Poirier and played a song.
The winner also recorded Kai Kara-France, who quickly invented Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first wheel.
He also defeated his opponent Sean O'Malley.
A surprise no one ever expected.
This brought a female band of Bantam's weight between Amanda Nunez's and Julian's money.
The United States entered a mutual battle as a mental “trembling, ” Nunez did not lose seven years and brushed his teeth to another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel took place in the spirit of paperwork.
Nunez opened the way for a very active victory, and the enemy even saved the push kick that sent her to the country.
The money, however, failed to make any further mistakes, and she tried unsuccessfully to get back on her own.
The second bike was swirling and the MMA fans were very busy.
Both of the adversaries were very proud of the excellent officers and the hardhearted.
She also got Nunez's money on the ground where she started beating her.
That had to give up the power and the attack was over.
The American prepared all the huge shocks when she became a new champion.
The war between Charles Oliveir and Dustin Poirier on the title in the light bag was a battle.
At first, Poirier got better, but the map gradually began to turn.
In that second attempt, he tried to be more active, Oliveira, who tried to get a pack on his hand.
It didn't tell him much, but then he made a big pressure, got a fight on the back, and slept on him a lot of wounds.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a race of shocks, which Poirier had experienced for a while, but then he had to break down.
The Brazilian was so famous about the title, Poirier, but after two years he lost.
In the next game, he signed the sovereign triumph of Sean O'Malley, who had already settled in the first wheel on Rauliana Pai's solid right back.
Next, he got a series of exact weighted hits and marked the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
The next triumph of Nunes with a little girl, now seven years later she's gone.
That one, or that one?
There's nothing complicated about the first look.
Most of the essential names in the Czech Republic refer to only one grammatical family, and therefore there is no problem with determining whether it is a male, female or middle family.
Then there is also a relatively small group of key names in which the family is not established.
Such fundamental names are intertwined with two families.
Then two concoctions will be acquired and, in some cases, they will remain inconsistency.
For example, the words “swift” or “swift” are the species of man and woman, and the first is the pattern of “motor” and the second is the pattern of “song”.
In other subgroups of essential names there are different forms already in the first case of a single number, ‘line/order’, ‘kedluben/kedluben’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (for food).
Both forms are therefore written, have the same meaning, and are therefore free of exchange.
Some expressions may be regionally absent, such as "cock" in Czech and "kock" in Moravia, but in this case the Morabian variant is inconceivable, similar to the Czech-Mervian two words: "pocket" and "pocket", "kocket" and "cobile" etc.
Some of the words that came from other languages were originally inconceivable, but gradually the Czech connotations.
A typical example is the term “image”, which is the type of male and female, or the word “buffet”, which remained in the middle species, in the male but has the ends according to the pattern “hound”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation appear directly on the Greek borders?
At the river-Turkey border, there is a growing number of migrants who are trying to get to Europe.
Thousands of people began to cross the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece support, humanitarian aid also comes from the Czech government.
What actually motivates the rushes to the uncertain road?
And how does the situation look right on the spot?
We haven't seen blue sky for three months and we've been breathing, says a Sydney journalist.
The fires of fires that have been burning in Australia for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and have left millions of acres of land.
How do foreign authorities and private citizens compare with the common people?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent the tragic effects, how do they claim to be critical?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the context of climate change?
Lenka Cabrel's talking to a journalist from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written everywhere.
For people, it's unacceptable to solve how sexual violence appears in our society and how dangerous it is, so it's trying to shut down.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who've been raped and I've seen how often they've been treated by the police or by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that victims finally open up their traumas.
But it's still as much people as they leave it for themselves.
Yes, they'll find a secret who's falsely accused of someone.
It's a shame and it's all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of guilt is meant" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual offenders.
Czechs flood divorce homes, families don't have money to finish
The cost of building materials in the last weeks and months increased by more than 30 per cent.
A lot of people are getting into a brilliant situation.
It does not have the means to end broken homes and banks refuse to raise mortgages.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction works is increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to end up in abandoned homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgages, which create extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people are moving into abandoned and unscathed homes.
In the latter case, the houses are disassembled, and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent for it," says the BHS economy Štěpán Kreček.
We'll build two or three family houses a year, and we'll have to do it by fifteen percent.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to keep some things legally, even if the material has been stolen.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
Many people will have financial problems first.
If they count on the building of the house to go up to five million, it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," adds Slivoň.
From the materials, she was the most affected by the med, iron and also the installation and heating equipment.
The construction companies, however, are also fighting the lack of labour force.
In Czech, there is a shortage of graduates of state councils, and a number of foreign workers are running the pandemic.
It is now more evident that only the situation with regard to the granting of a building permit.
"In October 7,675 construction permits were issued by the building authorities, which is almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," said Kreček.
We're gonna be fine and we're gonna have better.
Real vision, but missing, says commenter CHRO – myRozhlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to classical celebrations, has already traditionally been carried out and policy developments.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and President of UNO Andrey Babies and the evening message of President Miloše Landa and the President of the Senate and the Ambassador's Senate.
What the hell did we find out?
As a super-right diploma comes to me, I have my own theme that I've chosen, I've been referring to a football player, I've always been doing it all year and then I've got two writing parts a week.
The states are completely comfortable with us, if there's no man of total macaw and there's something left in his head, so this commission won't be going to waste him on the theory.
I must have studied in the state for a week, and when I was at the end, the Commission always tried to point me to some logical driving that just happened to me and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to do this semi-final project to them (we have done it many times, really profitable, much learning) and then only learn the project and have it exposed.
I think it's great if at the end of the article there's a test to which the knowledge gained under the project is not just a challenge.
But don't ask for e-mails and phones and don't force any packages on the embassy.
You'll be the same as them.
These people on the mission need nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so they might have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can make the same kind of Putin's juice next to the bear's juice.
You still have to give it to Xi Jinping to the back or something.
I agree, even though the Insta is covering artists with clicky feet.
As long as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a simple minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important than the function, whether the ring, comment or storage.
I'm afraid this is happening lately, so maybe I'm going to have to cut myself down to a ticket where a lot of artists from my business are successful and they're not able to afford it.
In the end, I might also like if there's something that's got to do with something that doesn't benefit from the artists of all creativity and energy.
Statements by the Parties working on Donbase
Svazu – yes, breaks – no, they express their view on the picture of the re-dispersion of the SSSR.
Thirty years after the illegal shelling of the SSSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history.
In the Belgian spring of 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevich signed the agreement that “Svaz SSR as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist” without any legal or violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991.
In one stroke of the pen, almost three hundred million people have been "destroyed" by the vast country.
By the fall of the SSSR, tens of millions of Russian ethnics have been born abroad.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has fallen from ten to one million.
And despite the loss of the Russian population of former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars!
In the past, the same people who destroyed what had been established over the past seven decades have created a socialist camp (created at the price of millions of lives in the second world war and in the Great War of Property).
The deindustrialization, the destruction of agriculture, the removal of the world's largest power of fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked to the single mechanism.
If we want to see more deeper, then we see the disintegration of the population, the breakdown of the economy, the science, the army, the increase of crime, the interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Society area, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO on the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab era, the war in Syria – that is all the result of geopolitical capitalization, the first appearance of the Socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politics as "vacuum force".
All that was quickly detected and released was quickly filled and reached NATO countries that adopted our geopolitical capital.
And the whole world is still devastated because of the events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with large turnover must not directly match its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some mass in the supermarket, which is 189 Kč / kg.
I'll buy it by giving it to her in the refrigerator and do it on Thursday night.
In an alternative reality in which I don't buy this mass on Monday, it's going to go down to 99 Kč / kg on the Tuesday net - will you describe the mechanism that will change its price for my life system?
And I'll wait until Thursday, and this mass will be 1 day before the consumption date is reduced to 69 Kč / kg - what would this mass be all about what I bought on Monday about 120 Kč dragon and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These chapters about that if something is cheap, it must be definitely bad, proven or inqualified to tell you the truth;-)
I recently went to Brná on Hlavas, and in the afternoon the lady gave me a brochure like that, I'm always taking things to help the Brigades, and they can't...
Well, the brochure was full of agricultural wisdom and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be something like this.
After I read it, I found out who published it, and finally, science came out of it.
Well, like that was a good master, full of complete lessons, like I'm supposed to be and not a pizza.
It's too bad paper. That's why the passes don't go away.
I've had something like this with an ex-boyfriend.
Psychiatric manipulation and emotional irritation will bring you to the person to answer because you like him without knowing how much in the p* part of this situation is.
She threatened me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment, she broke up before and asked me not to eat at her knees.
Then she began physically blocking the door.
For a year, it was a great relationship, but then he ran for another six years and started shooting at her.
Then I ended the relationship with what I told her that I was breaking up with her, but I can still talk about it next week to calm her down and get some rest.
Such a man of yours pours out feelings, emotions, and total joy.
It's better to keep your distance.
If the insurance is stolen here suddenly by the purchase of the darkness of the tests and by the positive, who would not be aware of the terrible failure of the test.
The only thing we can achieve is the complexity of companies, transporters and others, because their employees in the generator of suitable numbers fell five days of domestic prison.
In the background, they had already stopped with this scarf and realized that it was not worth solving the disease worse than that famous plague.
Unfortunately Válek is new and has to grow something else and get rid of the ego by thinking bulsating.
I'm looking at the old smile coming back to us again.
After several years of beatings and harassment of this kind of business, MLM recruiting returns to release.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first on VS), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested, especially a bunch of people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer, since I wanted to help people, however training was more on how to frighten and avoid people.
When the first money came, the man quickly realized that if he wanted to make it, he had to pick up a few other products a month.
Investments in life insurance and mortgages were the only ones who felt that man was being a subseller of the mines.
But I can say, experience was valuable, a man learned that he must not jump to every corner and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in one pit.
People in this business are successful and even people are prosperous, but they will certainly not be credited with expensive consumer goods or a "winner" account.
I didn't have a lot of things to do in the corporation.
The HR is calm, the managers are looking for their management, and we're not getting into anything.
The correct assessment is, however, something happens in the way it works in us. (set some goals for the next year, we look at what happened and what not) - it's more important than someone would value you according to some numbers, and so on.
The company's action is not necessary either.
But in our company, we're also a little isolated - they're divisions that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a close-startup that sucks at the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works so we don't get too tired until it's the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
About ten days later, the British police were finally out of control after the missing 32-year Czech Republic, which was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the Jakub Kulhanek Demissions on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradishtska was found dead.
The British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that she had found the body of the missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not report any more information on the case.
A sincere sympathy, he pointed to Twitter Kulhanek.
The young woman last saw the 28th of November in the bus on the way out of work, she had to raise money from the bank.
Her disappearances were announced by colleagues at work five days later.
The next time the London Police started to retreat, Interpol organized it among the wrongs around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police were holding one man a few days ago in this relationship.
Like he was supposed to play his role and what he suspects, but she didn't tell him.
New representations were made at the end of the year in four municipalities
On Saturday, 11 December, in the villages of Komná in Uherskohraděšk, Lužice in Mosttec, New Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk, the new representative was elected.
The number of representatives in these cities has fallen under the law, or the number of representatives selected here has fallen.
Of the 28 candidates, 99 candidates were present in the new elections.
The voluntary participation reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the town of Equina, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
The mandate was made up of eight women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for the new election to the representatives in the four municipalities.
Of the 28 representative positions, 36 women and 63 men were present.
The average age of candidates was 46,6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections for us is symbolic of a relatively generous but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections have been held in the current representatives and, above all, very closely followed elections in the parliamentary Chamber.
In addition, we had to work most of the more advanced epidemiological conditions, which covered the higher levels of equipment and personal security, according to Eva Krup, 1th Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last election season was held on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday the results of the vote will be published by the Joint Committee of the State Volunteers and will be published in the Assembly after its adoption.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To deal with the fact that we've got a whole dangerous disease at the beginning of my whole life was going on for a while, but it went without any more seizures.
To deal with how idiots put a large part of the population in all its species, I have a problem with that right now.
I'll finally be less dependent on the fact that the rest of the people aren't gay.
It would be free of the president's role and ability to get her back.
The chance that it really comes to it, but the rest of us say very little.
Besides, I'm not sure if the retraced record would even give me a chance to consider it.
It is such an act that the President of the Republic threatens the integrity, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How pandemia affected intimate life: Growing numbers of people up to 35 years of age who are without sex all year long
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
One is mainly about religious people based on the Internet, the DailyMail daily.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, 35 youths who claim to be sexually active increased from eight to 21 per cent.
A woman between 18 and 35 years of age who said they had no sex in the last year is more than ever.
In order to reduce the number of sexually active individuals, there are other factors, he showed the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic consequences of the Coronavir pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But also the presence of media, social networks or videos that make for young people less and less emphasis on sex.
"Since 2010, men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 have grown rapidly, who claim that they did not have sex in the past year," said IFS Lyman Stone, a researcher.
Sexual activity is more common in married people, only 5% of them reported having been sexual-free in the last year of 2021.
In free people, it was 29%, and Stone added that marriage is only a small percentage of the age of 35.
Then, sexual activity is also contributing to fear of premise relations and religious foundations.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of women and married couples 35 years of age will continue to decline.
Young people view premise sex, about 30% of it is wrong, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are minorities, but their conduct is based on this trend," says Stone of the thirty percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex are due to religious background.
Since 2008, the average abstinence rate has increased from 20 to nearly 60 % in people under 35 years of age who attended religious meetings more than once a month.
The trend between "little believers" rose from 10 to 20%," Stone declared.
There are also other factors that contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, social alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower in people without work or less income.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media that obviously reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, which means they “repudiate this need”.
This trend is mainly due to the lockdown in the koronavir pandemic.
The whole vaccination plan against human beings is about whether the company should bring a portion of the population to conduct which they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It's a relatively difficult question that I'm particularly interested in with the issue of social consciousness.
For example, if we don't order them and they die, then it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be able to understand the death of an eight-year-old man who actually didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, heard some misinformation, and, as a result, didn't wait for it and finally got it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can be able to cope with the death of a closed expectations, which behind the SPD and the KSCH are linked to a fragile and comprehensive state.
Of the statistics I have mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unexpected pensioners are most likely to belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do so themselves.
Chechnya with no snow.
How does the peaceful winter describe the fear of drying?
The annual winter has already brought one of the lowest snowfalls in the Czech Republic for the last time.
Drivers of liquefied areas shall not be subject to technical snow, and the time shall be complicated by the preparation of the Jizers Falls.
It's about the trend, or the exception?
And what will a little snow mean for fighting dry in Czech?
I should have a story, but it's not about a bakery.
Once on the middle of the night, our teacher took us across the city on the boat so that we could go to the boats on the river.
On our way there, we went to such a pretty wide street and we probably don't see anyone in the middle - the stage of the Hare Krišna section.
Of course they slept on us.
I ran out of luck, but with a friend they got to talk to me.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul first.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including teachers, were tired of the whole way up to the shipyard.
We're a terrible misunderstanding.
It doesn't happen that much, but the system is already playing, says Orozovic.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with his military troops.
"We are opening a new chapter on mutual relations," Morawiecki said at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly make it clear that it will not accept the deterioration of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops in Ukraine's borders, is agreed by the Office to deal with the use of diplomatic units, as well as in the framework of the "Normand Group", which combines France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawikski stated that the Chancellor was informing of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukašenko, was able to address the migration crisis and uses people as a living field and weapon, because night after night we record hundreds of attempts on (unlawful) crossing the border.
He agreed with the Chancellor on other sanctions so that Lukašek's regime and his bosses in Kremlin finally realized that we decided to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, made sure that Warsaw was happy to support Germany in the fight against Belarus and condemned the Dutch conduct of Lukašenko's refugee regime.
A drunk Polish waitress was in trouble. She tried to stop it.
After a while the car returned to the crash site, however, the car was already run by another jeepian who tried to take the blame on himself.
When the police informed her that she could come out with a driver's license after a week of driving and getting out of town, she went out with the truth, introduced TVN24.
She admitted that she had a different pocket in her car, which she asked for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestin.
They took her to the hospital, and after they found out that she had more than two drops of blood, they immediately picked her up with a driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she was going to talk to the court about her actions.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Shaymovic didn't watch his movie.
The pure form of family comedy has been seen in the American history of pets.
But they forgot about the main thing: the legality of the film show.
After filming a movie by F. Brabce Gump - dog that has taught people to live, it's now a wonderful feeling in movies. Here we are watching.
Spolluator of the scenario and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. freely refers to his previous film Here I have been watching since 2012.
Here's a scene going back to the talker Hugo and some well-known positions around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the forest pension, who smiles, and they start calling him a singer, Julian's father and her daughter Veronica.
She's no longer a little girl, she's probably a grown-up girl who lives the first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Shajmovic (who is also a producer film) were involved in the process of recording already in the previous dog picture, but at least children and dogs were there.
This time, she wrote a picture of two more bad scenarios that triggers a mixture of excitement and feelings of sadness.
Let's go hide it.
Julie, although a scientist, is in the womb of a child with dark blues and if the right "constellar" comes, meets her forest engineer Ivan, where the co-ordinator directly determines – on the roof of a car or a church wall (of course during a local tour with a guide), served Colonel Mojmír in spite of the flight training of his own daughter (Julie), who will fall into the coma of a family hospital in order to play an amazing healing process in the heart of the forest alone.
Nothing against pure treatment of nature and animal strength.
Their owners know why they have it.
But wonder what the contents of the entire dismal situation and figure were needed for this message.
Two thieves from staff, dogfighters, forest charlatan, police coming to search for "drugs" and discussing the facts about the enchanting strength of bone marrow – and of course, the frozen family in the pension drinks.
When the liver is examined and returned after a hard comet and is placed on a cigarette at the family table and requires the father’s whiskeys and vials as a vegetarian treated, it cannot be laughed.
The proposal is still strange, explains that "it sometimes happens after a comment".
The Shajmovic team misses basic dramaturgic knowledge of work with text, ability to expose the nose situation, feeling for the character of position and point and regime direction.
The Greek executions are unmatched, the tears of the infamous and the whole realm of confidence.
No matter how Luke Vaculík, Jitka Jehovah or Nela Boudov strives to stand up, they have nothing to play.
The only film record remains the poetic collections of the wild nature of the cameraman Vladimir Hollomka and the two jewellerys.
It is not enough to design a number of headings, charts and platoons, thus allowing for human vulgar expressions.
The argument is not even the flight membership of the driver's club - as in the case of the manufacturer.
For good reason to promote nature and human friendship, the dog must also be known as a bear if he wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't happen in this case.
On a good family picture there's a little too much erotic and a minimum bit more for jealousy.
Not even as a advertising for canisteria, this amateur posse wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant demands from fools just like you.
It's the difference between the offer and the offer, it's here to see how you're stupid about it, but it's just because you've never experienced it.
The decision is always on the client, if he doesn't want to, the answer will not always be.
If you've ever listened to a joke like this, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like everyone else, in which case the Brigade is on the hill.
The near east is not usually dry months.
The winter is the only time in the year when it's dry.
"The complete absence of conflict during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, Kfar Gilead district in northern Israel reports only six per cent of the long-term battle range in November.
The two-week rain from this week was therefore more exceptional.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been here a long time.
It's also the proper holiday resort, glad to have the inhabitants of Nazaret Vasim Askar.
The conflict in Israel occurs only in the winter months, they are natural and irregular.
The winter rains are dependent on forests.
Without them, they will be driven to the Fire.
It's not only about forests but also about the supply of drinking water and land for farmers.
This year the largest sugarcane source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, filled the lake with the last three abundant winters.
It's been cold since then.
Water operators have been warning of drought for a long time.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there can be a conflict here," Israel's Water Agency spokesman Uri Schor suggested in 2018.
Israel will be able to assist technologies such as detonating or recycling waste water.
The mountains are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the main city of Jordan, Amman, there are tankers.
Water and private waste are still breathing.
"This year, orders rose from seventy to eighty percent compared to two years ago," reported Imad Sulejman, the driver of the tanker's truck.
In Iran, the strike between the farmers and the security forces broke out in the Iranian Isfahan.
Because of the protests, it was dry.
The Coryto local river seemed completely waterless.
The region has its most recent November in recent years.
Israel is preparing a military campaign against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister stated that the meeting in Vienna did not lead to "no progress" and that he informed Washington of the preparations for an attack on the Iranian nuclear plant.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the opportunity of a military officer against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to issue their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington of military preparations.
During the press conference at Florida, Gantz said that nuclear communication in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world's powers "know that the Iranians are playing with them".
It happened to me about three years ago.
I picked the lady up a little bit and screamed at the conversation to find out what she really wanted for me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these fusses, so I gave my lady a moment of uncertainty and questions, and finally I thanked and left.
Please tell me I've played, but pyramids are pyramids and financial advisors are financial advisers.
The candles went up on the weekend, waiting for enough snow and good weather.
The Czech mountain center was the first major effort on this weekend.
After the discharge at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some skieries have started the operation.
History has not done anything to prove itself on the train with human certificate.
While trainers do not complain of interest on customers, some of the wage of laser equipment reports a lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
At the racetracks and at the stadiums, thousands of people in Liberia appeared on the weekend.
The lakes had a time to offer the sun and beautiful snow conditions today.
"We are comfortable, this charming weekend has already gone from the Friday night lie when we had the first skirmish," praised the interested director of the Sports Area Ještéd Jacob Hanuš.
In the first weekend of the new season, hundreds of people also appeared to the Yesenians.
For example, Sky Aréna Karlov or a middle school in Branné in Žumpersk was opened.
Weekend's visit was very obedient, and on Saturday and today 400 people came to visit.
The conditions are approved.
Today the sun shines, there were about three degrees, so perfect, did not admire the glorious representative of the laser medium in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Operators of ski areas can only sell ships to people who are expected or are in the long run after the spread of the disease of covid-19.
When these people are prepared and shown the necessary evidence, ČTK René Hronès from Špindler's ski resort, Mlün said.
"We've only reported incidents," he added.
More interesting than before the pandemic, there are some loans and sales of laser equipment.
They're interested in finding a bed of pleasure.
It's not like in the past, but it's still a lot of customers, says Alexandra Bokišė from the general sales of Skipopa.
More effort is expected in the period of skiing courses.
The king's director of Snowbear David Shinták also feels that because of the people, it is not about the purchase of the liquefied equipment that is as interesting as before.
This time before the pandemic, we've been almost reimbursed.
In contrast to the period before the pandemic, we're about 50 percent, ČTK Schinták said.
According to him, people broke up with pandemics and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, a large demand is recorded in the Novaco area at God’s Daru.
The loans started a week ago, and the stakeholders now have to order them in advance.
"We start to rent this weekend, but people have already called before, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like Loni," said Paulina Novak's operator.
Interests comparable to the period before the epidemic are also reported to be in the ski school.
If we want successful and rich people not to go abroad, there must be a chance to live a quality life as in a foreign country.
This certainly does not involve socialist medicine, where dentists or specialist doctors are often not likely to be present.
There are smart and smart people who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company's foreign business doesn't go that far.
But the rest of you just agree.
If these people don't live well in the PRC and if these people don't have a reasonable future in the PRC, they just don't live in the PRC.
The migration from Hungary began to win a beautiful day of Orbán, a year of ruling, and the annual migration took place about a few tens of thousands.
It's naive to think that CR can't appear in a similar position from day to day.
Other questions are even voluntary.
If you're going to live a fool here, you can also win some traditional V4 freak.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and the people whose property will not be thrown into the plane.
That's a great picture!
Langmayer in blood because of beer sauce?
While in Česk was in full swing, in Thailand the state of the film Island in front of Jiři Langmayer (55) enjoyed tropical time!
Herec, in addition to social networks, published a blood photo of the face.
Is it a real injury, or is it about counting because of a seizure?
The London police are still looking for the unknown Chechnya.
Last time she was on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petry is not like her behavior and we start to be very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor in a Saturday video from the police department in the fourth Lambeth, where Srncov worked.
"Your family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her, and soon wants to know where she is," she continued.
The wrong Czechs said on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45, she left work and set home to the fourth Chamberwell.
Lastly, she was seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was announced on 3 December by one of her colleagues.
Srncov, according to the British media, has become a “healthy nurse” in the child hospital Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
"We have irreconcilable concerns about our dear colleague, Pedro, who is not aware," said the Twitter contribution of a group of medical devices.
"We would like to win anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police," continued the communication.
The public also calls for cooperation by Mr Harriet Harman, who, on Saturday in the case of Srnc, warned at the press conference.
"It's strange for a few days now, it's only 32 years old, it's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understanding of death," said a labist politician, who held a photo of a woman distributed to the Polish police.
"I feel that we all have a great responsibility in particular to try to find her because she was outside her home country, away from her family and working here for our health," said Harman.
In the past, the police had already kept a man who was in custody.
According to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information on his identity or what he suspects.
Russia is not able to host Ukraine and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't even appreciate Ukraine like this.
It's not "survival mass", but about 8 percent of Russian soldiers.
Notice that Ukraine continues to repeat that the threat of Invaze is raising and begins to have our full teeth in it.
I was quoting up.
I don't know what you've accused of wanting the Russian war.
Valka is a fucking lovely game and Russia has HDP Italy.
The comparison of the situation in the year 38 is so far away that I don't even know where to start.
I can now compare it with the first battle of the Punch and the "anix" of the following :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not agree to comply with the agreement with Minsk, Russia will annotations to the foreign republics.
That's all, and that's how the "concentration" on the borders would answer.
One, the deal is a servant...
In Prague, since Sunday, there are new traffic lines, especially direct connections
Traveling in the Prague Integrated Road (PID) has been waiting for several changes since Sunday which are particularly concerned with direct connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the path, and others have disappeared.
The integrated system is reintroduced into Mladaboleslavsko.
In the main city, from Sunday to Sunday, fasts are stopped from the Czech Budéjovic station in Zahradní City.
In the direct trainway, the S7 trains, which travel from Berouna to the Czech Brod, are passing through the Persian main sea.
In the newly built Prague-Zahadný City station, R17 from Czech Budějovic and Benezova will be stopped again.
The PID will now expand into other areas.
Besides, they will eat buses to the light of Sázava, Blatna in Jesenica, Old Splavs and Turnova.
Buses will be included in the Mladaboleslavsk region including a line with the transfer to Liberia and the Kingdom.
When integrated, 77 lines will be removed, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 comes from the Persian Gulf, which runs to Žatce.
There was also a new direct connection to Praha – Kralovice in Rakovníka, which replaces the broken traffic line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning and on the weekend they will join Prague to Rakovníka when the new expression line number 404 comes out.
New links to the PID system include 400 and 410 lines to the Liberian country.
They're coming out of the Metro Střížkov station, not from the Nádarží Holesovice Station.
The Paterial Line 400 goes through Mälník, Dubou and Česko Lipu to the New Boru and the selected links continue to Rumburka or Cwikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mälník and Dubou to Docs, Mimón and Jablonné at the Pojätė.
On the other hand, a new operation is cancelled or restricted on ten medieval local routes, including to Mochov, Good or Rožmital under the Third.
All trains with departure from Prague were cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of railways, long-term restrictions on Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá over Labem and around Kolina continue.
Changes await travel as well as other places.
Buses replace some broken railway lines or expand the line 420 from the Best with the presence from Prague, where it is possible to use the PID trains to Milevska.
The change has resulted in routes 540 to 543 in Nymburg and the routes of some buses on the border between Czech and Horóvika in the Plzeńsk region have been adjusted.
Healthy dinner/feed to the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing classics 9-5 with a 30-min stop and my only chance to get some food is to go next to Billy or the kiss next to Lidla.
Because I don't have any moves, I don't have the power to work, so I have to eat the most healthy and diet.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'm buying at a speed maximum pizza on earth and for every jogurt and apple.
Question: What would you recommend to buy in the supermarket without the need for warm repairs?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, so I'm sorry.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Under the snow it can only hide a piece of wood.
If it disappears, the tree may be more prone to ovarian disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're forbidden to drive out of the seats, but it's one of them.
Acknowledging Dary on the relationship with the Germans: I was never happy about this.
A Chechnya fishing fish from five lives nothing other than the discovery of the relationship between Dary Rollins and Paul Neveda.
They've been taking it together for years, the famous footballist has even let it grow because of the singer.
Dara now sent a detailed message to the fans, which explains why a long half-tillion silence was in front of them.
"I allow myself to say that there is no one in Czech and Slovenian at present except for Dara being caught by a bear, then sorry, Nedveda," Dara Rollins tweets, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player ever after the ears.
First, he beat her, not at all.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are in the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we didn't both enjoy, but we knew it would happen one day, the song continued.
I just don't know who's up there.
If you don't even care about it and get it out of their store, or we're asking them in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you're dating your husband or friend enough, or you've remained on it, but you've really been aware of the list of your former partners and have been aware of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's hot, you want it, Darre.
Two of them met together in Italy, where Rollins drove to prepare his new fashion collection.
Soon they're acting as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth to this day because they were waiting for Nevid's divorce to end.
Ivana and her wife had been sentenced to three years in prison, and the papers were not their own, but for the first three weeks.
Anyway, those who are happy with us and give us that, thank you.
And we're just people, we have families, children, history and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new husband, and just like he is with me, I stand with him.
Hey, the other commenters already said almost everything essential, I'm just confirming that the wheels are great in the beginning, my colleagues mostly met during the first semester or two met and scand and then found themselves together, which will come to me as the best option because you know who you're going to live with.
Most of the apartment doesn't look too long ago, so you're probably not going to find it now, but looking at the offer definitely doesn't hurt.
Otherwise, it certainly avoids not only Cel, but also around (the streets like Vranovska, France, etc., are quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a little ghetto.
On the contrary, the fourth Veverí is a very student, the King's field and this direction is good, and it's close to most VUT faculty (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never dreamed of rent, but I'm a native Brnák, so I can somehow consult Brne as if you've missed any more information :)
But that's an example of a "normal" consideration.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not fund enough of some schools.
Let him learn what he wants and pay himself out of it or go to the state and pay the state.
However, we cannot allow a private actor to control a school area simply because a number of courses will come to an adequate state contribution, and because of this he will be able to learn what he wants.
Such claims sometimes lose weight when written by a person who said it two days ago about a petition for a coup d'état:
So the voice against it if someone goes to bed is the same as the voice against you to keep some juice in place?
I'd be able to consult you directly with the man who gave you this job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced when cataloging/digitalizing that (and even long professional) it's either an hour from the eye, or they're writing something in the way of xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and in the notice that it's not readable.
It is true that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd like to make some note of what program you're using.
If you want to be a good and diligent student, you can look into some of the character databases and look for the closest.
But because it looks like you're cutting out some books, so I would just type out that the author or the printer just created his own character, which is based on what is physical on that myth.
PS: Isn't it a way to get rid of Odynia (kingdom) rather than OdyNská?
PSS: Someone's already told you that.

Politicians don't even know what the "the topic" of our presidency will be.
It's a lot worse than they're going to have trouble with them.
The idea that they would accept something because no one understood any text is funny.
All important approved documents are examined in words, and there is also some basic knowledge of English, which is the subject of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters are working, English is becoming more involved in non-formal relations, the introduction of standard relations.
In addition, this is quite interesting after the EU's GB is released.
I don't get that hate at Hell.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm fine.
I've been driving out of work for 10 nights and I've never had a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's almost out there.
Yeah, most of the Roma population live there, but the only thing they do is stop on the walker and park where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the center, I'd go to it quietly.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Fathers and Loves Gelems as a bowl in the floor!
Who cares about Christmas?
On Sunday most people in the Advent prison burned the first candle, Felix Slováček didn't.
I don't have an Advent prisoner, so there's nothing to burn.
I saw the father of the prisoner, and Lucie must have had someone too, said a white saxafonist who so confirmed Patras' words that she visited her often.
He's visiting, but he doesn't live in their house in Vinohradch, where Dad was staying alone after his departure.
The dictionary still doesn't know where it's going to be on Saturday night.
We recently met Anička, Felix, and the two grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemvá: ZASE SPOLU!
But we kept saying something, so we didn't get to Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I buy cash regularly, and I'm sure Dad and Lucia buy something, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, he added Felix, who came to be baptized in a music video clip at Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to play with, the Slovak who was pleased to meet the wife of Ludzka Sobaty Adrian or the singer Kamila Nyvltov.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford to have no soldiers and weapons?
I suspect that someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressive must be a simple idiot so that he doesn't have this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so you explain it to me?
I don't know any other ingredients that could be found in the hospital crisis.
The police are small and they can't afford to do this, just pretend, and nowhere else is such a high percentage of healthy trained people.
And the fact that our army is capable of killing Ostrava as long as I've been in charge of the previous government, not the army, is a long time ago.
The record dry in the PRC.
It is necessary to change the agricultural supply, the country should not only be a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech is going through the worst dry season in the last few years.
According to researchers, water has been killed in mountain and sub-Saharan areas, lower levels of friction are also recorded in places where there has been no demand for entry.
The cause of drought, which is prevalent in much of Central Europe, is climate change.
But it's also comforting how we manage the land.
What do you mean I'm ready for?
And how can we help in times of distress?
Yeah, I'll be right, I'll just stay in the woods on the ice. I know what to play hockey and this tactic (which I tried in Franchise hockey Manager) is also quite loud.
And if you're a hockey team "Medwid Russia" or "Mama China" you're gonna lose two goals, even if you don't have to win each game at all price, it's different than it's compared.
But just as I listen to the Czech commentators who say what they say, the decision makers don't understand whether male or female hockey anymore, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian Hercis" or motor sport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the opposite of it, it's like always, and that Czechs and Russians have won more often than they have won, it's probably the classic "wars have won" all "we've won".
Coronavirus: Number of orders in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic registered 9080 daily orders.
There are 5766 people in the hospital.
A total of 34 451 people died in QR, 74 others.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 100 000, 871 per 100,000 per last week in 1967.
The number of orders in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29 929 new orders were registered.
It's the lowest day number since 13 October.
The total number of registered orders in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of days of death is 1132, it's the lowest number of days since the end of October.
The British head of the "inexhaustible" huge wave, caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on television by Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the British Health Agency.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron patients have already been hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
So far, no one has died on the omicron, but it's about fourteen days after the seizure and about three weeks after the seizure.
The head of British labs, Keir Starmer, found on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by breaking the law in December when he was taken to lockdown and was banned for Christmas parties, he arranged a holiday party at Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson's government pointed out that the dispute was "virtually" over the computer.
He was also involved in the Downing Street team of employees gathered around the computers.
In Britain, there's a pressure to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
During the late December, when London closed the lockdown and Friday evenings were banned, Johnson's ministers were arranged to read the lockdown.
The British public and the media complain that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of the ITV commercial television for Britain: Boris Johnson won most of the public elections two years ago.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the office of the Prime Minister.
It's amazing how quickly the events took place.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary's waiting for the election to end the 12th anniversary of Victor Orbán's government.
This will be the will of the whole of Europe.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be married.
They'll probably not even be free, because they weren't even the last two elections under Orban.
His side, Fidesz controls the media, changes the limits of the optional circles to benefit from it, and makes more smaller or larger tricks.
It's the last time it sounds like everyone can fly in practice wherever he wants.
This allows Fides to consider voters from the chosen circles to where the result is uncertain and opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that the party won't be at all.
Do you think this will be as bad as in 2014 and 2018?
Well, the situation is quite different.
It used to be not if Fides wins, but how much and whether he'll have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by united opposition.
It's a big deal for Victor Orbán and his side.
They won't be able to keep much longer to play?
Yes, we have some signs that they're ready to go beyond what they've done in the past.
She recently withdrew to independent media records of Parliament's president and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where the Heads of Secret Services report that opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, it's one of those newspapers.
It all starts with language.
I was pretty often beat, last year at 14, my mom's got little patience, and I didn't, her dad has a long time, but then she's very loud (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very cholera, and I got up like a little scared, to the point that I was lying on the ground in the lap and being a whole blue, so I was about to take 2x under my back so I could get down.
I used to dance out loud, and sometimes I didn't know it anymore.
Now I have a tendency to solve things with violence as little as I've got enough to do, now to throw myself into something dirty and as a youth I need parents so crying over my hands (to not get too much over the handle), so never get anything extreme, but always I've got it.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my enthusiasm, but certainly this training has its share as well.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with all the children, and I'm gonna do the same.
I think that being a child is just bad and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially at the moment when it wasn't "high", but out of frustration, on the other hand, almost every parent just takes a little sport, maybe it's not possible for their children to do it a little bit, so I don't read it to them.
It doesn't bother me. I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws must be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call the customers what the laws make in such a quality.
Otherwise, I'm wondering if you're not afraid of the accident of arrival?
Can you really count on people who want and buy the product and you'll have a mortgage to pay?
Cochiner's evil world.
Where's Slovenska running the process with the murder of journalist Kuciaka?
In Slovenia, the main proceedings begin with four suspects of the murder of Jan Kuciaka and Martiny Kušnírové.
The death of a investigating reporter and his partners has changed Slovenia.
She urged the civil society, but also dismissed the practices of the accused businessman Mariana Kočner and his involvement with the Slovak politics and justice.
What is the basic evil that will mean for Slovenia?
That's what journalists can do.
How is it possible that this petition had a lot more media attention than the opponents of all the medical colleges that went out every day, two later?

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of the city in the election is not at all
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlíčka needs to be processed mainly
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiše is in the end and the law that should ensure respect for the interests of the citizens and their citizens when selecting and permitting a high level of radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Governing Council rejected the proposal submitted by the government after the annual visits to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious dispute not only with the objects concerned in the Platform against the Deep Sea, but also with the City and the City of the CR.
Law self-laws expect more explicit strengthening of their possibilities when deciding on the role of the elderly as of 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its Coalition Treaty proposal, will be processing in cooperation with the inhabitants.
The proposal by Minister Karl Havlíčka, who has the Platform available, concerns citizens in particular: The proposed measure of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of location for the site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the city and its citizens.
In fact, it can only be effective if citizens or the public can influence whether the process will ever continue in this area.
This may be ensured by the deposit of the responsibility of the Board of Directors to apply for prior to the initiation of a specific procedure for the consent of the municipalities concerned.
The proposed proposal for an operational purpose almost completely forgets the involvement of the public and makes it practical only for the citizens of the city to be able to do so when conducting calls.
The proposal misss the system setting of compensation for the citizens for the entire search and selection of premises for the post office, its permit and its operation.
Representatives of municipalities actually do not have much opportunity to express the interests of their citizens when looking for places for posts.
However, the authority or minister in whose interest the permit is granted may only make their comments or withdraw.
The relevant application has no impact on the conduct of research or construction work.
The self-determination required by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democraticly successful countries and then decidedly in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of the office, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition, a further violation of the national administration, which is hired by the external legal office.
In this case, there is a contract with the law office HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was closed by SURAO and referring to a contract with lawyer Jan Zemakke.
The total amount for this work has to be made up of approximately 4 million dollars, according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, the mayor of the town of Cjle from the municipality Hrádek and the speaker Platforms against the deepest position, said: After ministers of the industry who compared the establishment of self-regulation against the state authorities in the search of the highest level of radioactive wastes, we are waiting for a new government to come up with a better deal.
We offer it and help.
We are also grateful for the support of Svaz City and Cities, whose problems with the lack of urban rights in such basic buildings are considered as directly affected cities in the selected areas.
The anti-dumping duty platform shall consist of 51 members (35 cities and 16 towns) for the purpose of transiting the state's access to fuelled nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste which will not only be limited to the deep station.
The platform further requests that the localisation decision be subject to the prior agreement of the municipalities concerned.
Herce John Goodman (69) gaveutil k k k k k k k k kdututti hrårt: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his life - style for many years, the doctors feared him.

It also depends on what boss you are and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's about some text on a platform that's expected readers from the middle of nowhere, I wouldn't have seen it.
If there were any formal texts and a high school text, I'd probably be looking for a better description or explanation.
There's more than one type of boss.
Maybe the game like Dark Souls has a few bosses that yes, and so is "boss" something like a master / ruler given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who are not even required to win to complete the game or level, but often are even stronger than standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where are the bosses, but the player with them is not straight (Tentacle, Gargantu), and they can be called something like that?
Well, then they're mini-boss.
It's suddenly one way to translate the boss just doesn't go, the Czech and other languages do not work out anything (it's interesting that only the Catalan language that will be translated as a final opponent).
It is a short story or game that is generally important, the computer controlled, the opponent stronger than all of the previous and monitoring the completion of some level or task.

Česko terrorizes Agent Tesla.

The flights continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3 October, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contains the most common attachment with the .exe extension that does not send the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
Still, the name of the account is also published.

A significant decrease and loss of activity is the safety analysis of the Fareit programme, which was 1.6 per cent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic over the past few months had no major attack campaign.
