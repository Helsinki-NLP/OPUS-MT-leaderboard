28 The Oldest San Francisco Shopping Center Found
The 28-year-old man who was moved to San Francisco recently died in the middle of a local shopping center last week.
But the victim's brother did not think that he could harm him. He said, "Then things were going well for him."
San Francisco Adli said that the body found in the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco poet who belonged to Frank Galicia.
San Francisco, the Department of State, said that the cause of death was identified and the investigation continued.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia, the U.S. ABC station in San Francisco, told KGO that Frank, who had previously worked as head of the Muslim department in Boston, began working as chief of San Francisco Sons & Daughters six months ago.
Sons & Daunters, said that this death "has turned itself into regret and regret at last."
He said, "There's a small team working like a common family here, and he'll miss himself very much."
We would like to point out that Frank's family was not alone at this difficult time and that our prayers were with them.
Louis Galicia said Frank was in the hostels at first, and he said, "Then things went well for him."
Louis Galicia said to KGO, "He kept a room and went out with a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he could be someone who might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a man of great heart, kind.
The way to build a family bond is always to prepare us a cigarette, make us eat." said Louis Galicia.
He'd never like to get into a fight.
My brother, I've always been in a position to do it.
He said, “Everything in the world is vanity, and it is nothing but a magic manifest.”
Those with the information requested to call the SFPD Emergency Line from the phone number 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors in grav: New job delays calls
The representatives of the assistant doctors requested that the trade unions be allowed to slow down with regard to the non-agreement of a new agreement.
The English Tabulators Unit (BMA) called on the General Council of Assistant Doctors (JDC) to support the process of slowing down more work than in July.
JDC said the guards didn't have any concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students have used a network game in agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a post published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt stated that the government had been "silently silent" about the issues that resulted in the rejection of the government's agreement.
He said, "In the light of this, the JDC Board of Directors has completely rejected the proposed new agreement and has been called upon to resume formal negotiations on concerns."
As a result of the lack of voice, the JDC administration found an official request to allow a programme to be allowed to slow down work by the BMA on Monday.
Inconsistencies caused the assistant doctors to participate in six greves of the first group in NHS's history this year.
Dr. Johann Malavana, an assistant doctor at BMA, used the BMA's terms of reference after a network game was introduced.
He said that during the pre-school meetings of the 54,000 assistants, the doctor and the speech teacher said it would be a good deal for BMA members to accept this.
After the vote, Dr. Jeremy Hunt indicated that he would be able to apply it in a way that would be appropriate for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Is it a 'unsatisfied'?
This was a food that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey came together to announce that the eight-month war, which was fought on Friday, was completed in symbol of the eight-month war.
But when Vladimir Putin St. Petersburg greeted his Turkish neighbour at the exhibition hall, I found out that Ankara was the most part of the party that wanted to leave.
His hand's stuck, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile was so weak and it's not said that there was any heat coming up against his own limited standards.
Instead, Recep Tayyy and Erdoğan mentioned "well friend" from Mr. Putin, five times, according to a report.
I was surprised at your number.
He also said that the relationship with Russia would not go back to a level before the crisis, and that it would reach a much higher level.
The next day, a newspaper here said that Mr. Erdogan was acting like nothing bad.
I think he was showing his own breath the exact opposite of that.
But Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the crisis: Turkey's failure to strike Russia's war aircraft at the Syrian border.
At that time, Russia's attitude was very limited.
Mr. Putin, when he made a tough exit, he accused Ankara of shooting Moscow.
It seemed that he was a friend of his own.
It's gonna be hard to rebuild confidence in a real sense, maybe impossible.
This month, the Russians changed their minds.
The government's media has targeted Ankara in a way that's been offensive and offensive for months.
Suddenly, everything became a crime in Turks.
The most serious of these were the charges against the illegal oil trade carried out in the areas under the control of the Islamic Government in Syria, in the words of Mr. Erdoğan's family of senior officials.
He definitely rejected it.
But the official message coming out of St. Petersburg was about time to move on.
Nevertheless, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin asked for President Erdogan.
Russia can see it as a sort of fraud.
The benefits of the fire call for Ankara are very clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs friends after his failed work, which is about to take place in the past month and is about to be ruled.
The terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected her very much.
And the economic reasons have also been affected.
Russia's actions have been frequented, especially by a number of millions of Russian tourists taking special trips to Turkey's northern regions each year.
That number fell almost 90 percent.
In Russia, both tour operators and rental companies were definitely relieved that flights would continue.
They're in a situation that's linked to the end of the season in Akden.
And this week, the government's TV, the Turkish trade products were re-authorized, and they were expected to be reimbursed for fruit and vegetables prices.
We're gonna get a news report from the Vedemosty newspaper, "Tourists over there, domates over here."
But your visit to Moscow had a special political value.
Ankara is angry with the situation in the workplace because of the lack of access to the West.
In addition to the long-term anger that has been fueled by the slow pace of the negotiations with the US, Turkey's relations with the West and its winters are due to Mr. Putin's desire to take advantage of it.
Russia's leader seems to have been collecting sympathy from Ankara for the call for support of the elected authorities after the accession of the Russian labour force.
It must be remembered that he too was an inevitable prisoner for Moscow, who was deeply afraid of the change in the empire.
This ceremony, which is arranged on this spectacular beach, is a "unsatisfaction of dreams" as explained by a analyst from Russia and Turkey: it unites the forces of the two countries that reject the East and act badly.
They're very different from each other, despite this remote view.
One of the most important things about Syria is that Moscow supports the various sides of Russia and Turkey if it appears to itself as a mobile phone.
After almost three hours of initial meetings, he supports this fact by saying that two others were not changed at the press conference.
Turkey's President, when he clearly refused to raise a question about these differences, Mr Putin chose to draw the bottom of these.
There is no clear consensus on how the partner country will be defined in Syria.
But months after the clear assumption, and when the NATO member of Turkey was confronted with the Russian warplane hit, it was definitely a good move to start talking with at least two leaders.
The Royal Bank of Iceland is missing for customers outside Iceland
According to the head of the bank's executive body, the RBS mark will be transferred to the back office position.
The Kingdom Bank of Iceland will be destroyed for customers outside Iceland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Isochaa that the RBS brand is related to the global goals of the bank.
Eight years ago, it was almost impossible to get rid of them and give up.
In the meantime, brand strategy experts used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial markets.
This was supported by millions of stars for sponsors to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion from the Six Ulus Raspberry Championship.
But now it was decided that more national brands would be right.
The Swiss Kingdom Bank will be used by Scottish customers but no new starters will be made.
All charges against RBS outside of the centre and bus in England and Galler will be changed as NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is currently used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will carry out a much more pressing task for the financial banking sector; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave a report on a company organised for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
The BBC told Iskoshia, "We're going to be a bank with more brands now than we're going to be in the RBS brand, and our staff will no longer be the brand of investors."
While the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
It's not global anymore, it's our local goals.
Every one of these brands, they're going to make a little difference in the population, and our staff will work under the names of these brands.
The RBS explained that the Six-year-old champion would not interfere with his sponsorship and that he was raising the profile of different brands in the field of sports sponsorship.
The executive director said, "Now it's time for us to come to understand the brands bank because (we asked ourselves) how can we do this better for customers?"
We'll be a great bank for our clients three years ago, and if we said we'd get these brands off, I'd find a way to get it.
But I think you're going to see a lot of changes, not our work and not ours, but our attention to the needs of our clients.
We can rewind these marks, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori won 3,000 times the prize he won in Newmarket with Predation
Dettori, with two success in Newmarket, opened the champagne after he reached 3,000.
Jokey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th prize in Newmarket on Friday.
On the ground floor, John Gosden's training with Predation won his second shift to this mile.
Italian, 45 years old, is the sixth jokey on this mile in an English-free race.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edery and Willie Carson.
And before that, the three champions in Ghiyar said, "This is a special situation."
I felt so much about my family being here.
I'm really happy to be in Newmarket 30 years ago.
This isn't an important meeting, not a Royal Ascot -- just a Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel lonely and relieved.
The detector accepted the presentations by bringing Predilection after the crash
In the English race, there were two matches on this mile: the champion's jokey Richard Johnson and 20 times the champion, and the record-full-of-the-art match, Sör Anthony McCoy.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby race nine times, wins 4493 prizes in the career of Lester Piggot
Frankie, it's not surprising that one of our best jockeys and only a few people have reached a mile.
It's tactical intelligence that has elements that make it difficult to print on the terrace.
He represents himself in an extraordinary way his horse race, and he's been drawing people for years with his excitement and career in this matter.
A few weeks ago, I told epsom that she could've reached six thousand yards without a match in the end of the week and in the big competition.
To be serious, Frankie has spent a great part of the 30 years he fought in the United Kingdom with a few tyrants that it's so nice to see.
He has a very exciting character and a very good characteristic for these English contests, but it's also an amazing jokey.
Frankie Dettori congratulated this mile of stone on his step-by-step in-step movement
Of the contests that he completed, with many moves to his feet, and with many moves to his knees, Frankie Dettori became the symbol of the English-in-the-fly races for the last few years.
It's a very brilliant path.
In 1996, the famous Ascot's "Great Jedili" race also won a lot of major competitions, and it was claimed that it did not comply with the law of medicine.
Three years ago, during the six-month period, he showed that he had a strong character to correct his doubts and make the best of his situation.
And it could go on for a while, and then Dettori said he wanted to continue fighting for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin took my special word from Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin took over my special word from Sergei Ivanov in an unexpected way.
Mr. Ivanov was part of the close environment that Mr. Putin had been trusting for years.
At the age of 63, he was now assigned as a special representative for environmental and transport problems.
In an explanation made by Kremlin, Mr. Putin's decision to end Ivanov's responsibility for Russia's administration was not given any reason.
Mr. Ivanov has been assigned to this position since 2012 by Anton Vaino, who has been in charge.
Vaino, 44, is an old diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia's Prime Minister, and was a member of the International League of Nations (MGIMO) of the International Institute of State of Moscow (MGIMO) and was a member of Tokyo's enlargement.
Later, the presidential protocol and the administration of government personnel were concerned; expressions on the Kremlin website are in this way (Russia).
After his assignment, Mr. Putin said, "Thank you for trusting me."
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as a head of the government by means of lawmaking and the application of instructions.
Mr. Putin explained on Friday that he wanted Mr. Ivanov to be removed from the Russian television channel and offered to replace Mr. Vaino.
Are the jokes convincing?
It's a brain that's amazingly beautiful in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest volunteers for a long time and has served the KGB for the Soviet security forces like him.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country as a private citizen.
At a meeting held by President Putin and published on state television, both stated that they had been given a special word with their own will.
But in spite of the disgraces given to cameras, very few people have been convinced of this, especially in this time of parliamentary elections.
And what about a misunderstanding from this kind of combatant?
Nobody knows that yet.
However, the official explanation that a potential president wanted to direct Russia's environmental policy at once was highly questionable.
According to Kremlin's website, Mr. Ivanov addressed Mr. Putin with the words: "It's true that you've been trusting me for four years for the task at the beginning of 2012.
Well, it looks like I've been in office for four years, eight months.
Mr Ivanov, this assignment took place in April 2011.
The president's assistance and defence were already in charge of his duties.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB security forces such as Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin appointed Mr. KGB as head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), who took the place of Mr. Ivanov.
When Mr. Putin crossed the border, Ivanov was one of the five most trusted.
Mr. Putin's third term was thought to be the president after Mr. Ivanov's second term.
But this assignment was transferred to Dmitry Medvedev, another close protector of Putin.
Mr. Putin was president three years later before he returned to his office.
The year of the criminal Minds series, Thomas Gibson, was arrested after he hit the manufacturer.
Gibson, our last month in Los Angeles, has been protected from physical warfare.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who were responsible for the structure of the directory, heard that he had been fired from work in a joint statement.
The Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, who was inspired by the Special Agent Hotchner, issued an apology on Saturday before his arrest.
There were differences and misunderstandings about Sette's creative issues.
One of them said, "I'm sorry that such a thing happened."
In ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, a group of characters played by Gibson describe how to get out of a program that monitors the FBI.
Earlier, the 54-year-old actor in Dharma & Greg's status committee was still in the program since the first season of 2005.
Gibson said, "I love criminal Minds, and I've been working for twelve years with my heart and soul."
I'd like to stay to the end, but it's no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the manufacturers, the actors, our great team, and the best supporters that can have a program.
The program is expected to return to screens on 28 July for the 12th season.
The size of the fish in the Banff field
A man living in Banff district found help to identify the fish that came out of Banff's garden.
Kevin Bain thinks this 75-fish can be fish fish that can be transported with my seabed.
Bain, a distance of 500 metres from the sea, was released in Periscope with the hope that some of the fish would be lighted in two inches long.
Queensferry Passion: The summit is now connected to Fife
The project of $1.35 billion needs to be completed by May 2017
The engineers combined the north and west of Queensferry's Pass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four interlocks between the "table fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three corners of the tower.
The cut from Fife is 600 meters long and 30,000 tons weight.
10,000 tons of sugar and 20,000 tons of concrete are made of 46 supports cables.
The $1.35 billion project needs to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Bank Keith Brown became one of the first people to visit the foundations of today's map.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Cross.
We're all witnessing in the real sense that this project used to build only 30,000 tons of concrete for this part of the building.
Despite the incredible size and weight of the gap between the gap between the wall table and Vijadik, a hard work that would require the most severe tolerances for this suit.
In general, in almost 79% of the total wall table, this means that the concrete floor of the first floor of the table will be realized in Rosyth today and that will be ready to be removed on the entire wall.
Forth Gocit and Kührer Müteahithts Project Director Michael Martin said: "The first stop is always a kilometer in all bridge projects.
This amazing project, this closure, the construction engineering, represents the advance.
After the location of the last Royal Table and the connection to the expanded North Pole level, we had to close the space on the north-west side of the Kara.
This was done by being dragged to the sun up to 700 millimetres north.
It was a very big, but at the same time it was a very sensitive process.
Because of its size, it had to be almost 6,000 tons of water at 222 meters long, and it had to be taken at about 3 degrees.
The reason for the accident was that the team's tolerance values were very low; they were only a few millimetres on both sides.
Anyway, everything's fine.
Moelfrei Corfezi rescue team: three men 'lucky 'cause he's alive'
Three men, after falling off the fishing boat in England, are lucky to be alive.
Moelfre RNLI's flashing flashing station announced on Friday at 13:20 a.m., after seeing the event in Moelfre Corfezi.
Three men were trying to get to a safe area while the boats continued on their own.
Moelfre's Physicist said, "We have seen that the technology is drawing them straight lines and we are worried."
He said, "Would that we had gone far away from them by strong winds until we had guided them."
When two men were rescued by a local fisherman ship, a third man in his 60 ’ s was found holding a feast without being swallowed up.
All of them were taken out to the cancer clinic, and brought to the cancer clinic.
Mr. Jones said, "Happy are the three men who have fallen down to you because they have been alive and have never been hurt.
There was an emergency stop key in the boat engine, but it must have been one of the people who used the boat when it was loaded.
These three men were watching people today.
A worthy flight type for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really surprising to see how the world changes.
It's been a sad situation for many of us over the past ten years, that young people and children don't go out to play games anymore, prefer to spend their free time on screens.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move away from the canyon.
When viewing the screens, he was exposed to video games and finally to smart phones when he was limited to his head TV.
That's why it's really great to see that technology and open air move are not things that separate us from each other.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that was created for the main video game in the 1990s (later turned into line charts, game cards and other side products).
Like a lot of popular culture, this new game became part of when it was celebrated in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Later, pressure in other countries was caused by the heavy burden on servers.
In days, Pokémon Go Tinder reached the same number as Twitter.
So how does he work?
If you have to explain in a short time, players will call Pokémon in a way that's followed by GPS, and they can't take photos of their findings (by taking a picture on a screen on a phone) or they can't.
He joined this madness when he came out of the cane for a family call he played in younger years.
The game in the U.S. has provided a valuable increase in the number of actions that a person takes every day.
Cardiogram, who was developed for Apple Watch, and who was watching 35,000 users, recently reported that the person who spent 30 days in jail every day has risen from 45 percent to 53 percent in Washington Post.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, but it can only see the data at an unexploited level.
The "30-minute difference", "out of the cane," and "to be active every day" were followed by the public health campaign, the frequent public health message being transmitted by people who appear to be present.
But it's not as important as your exercise.
In general, people who do not exercise do not have cancer or depression.
It has a list of long-term advantages in matters like high dances and diets, and it's not listed here.
But Pokémon Go's beauty is to get out to do what people like.
In this way, there are three basic elements of health: movement, clean air, and the sun’s light.
Some people can even make new friends during the summer.
As always, there are unskilled players calling for something to complain about.
And when someone walks, he can hit the door.
What's the difference?
It was a big news event.
Even though we've been watching smart phone applications like Fitbit, we haven't been asked for a reason to do nothing like this.
The innovation will be over, and my use will slow down in time.
But Pokémon's success will result in many games that will help make people more active, formal and healthy by combining their applications and virtual reality with activities in the real world.

Simone Billes, she got the gold medal when she was rated as a genius.
Forget the press.
You forgot your breath.
Simone Billes is sorry about all this.
It's dynamic.
Shut the fuck up.
It's a surprise with the earth.
From the beginning, it's perfect.
And now he's an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American chemist, after completing his general assessment on Friday, made a clear distinction between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
The 62,198 points received at the summit were on Aliya Mustafina, a friend of the "Son Five" group of gold medals and a friend of Aliya Mustafina.
The performance of a woman at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, organized by Simone Billes, Brazil, was performed by the United States of America at the end of the artificial diagnostic general evaluation.
Billes, the fourth and fifth American woman who received the general appreciation for the back, and probably heard the name of his own generation and perhaps the best of all times.
When the last group was released, it was filled with their eyes, and this mother's long journey to reach it ended.
This success led to the same level as Michael Phelps at every generation where the track reached new levels:
Billes spent the last three years of the 15th World Championship on gold, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton was one of the most successful races in the race with which he was called "the best magician I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting for him in Brazil; this was between himself and the other people who fought with Billes, and the burden that big expectations created.
Texas was supposed to be disappointed by the return of a gold medalist to the family in Spring.
From the United States of America, Simone Billes, left, and Aly Raisman, in Brazil, 2016 rio de Janeiro Write Olympics, followed by a series of awards for artistic women, and after they received the gold medals, Persembe, Agur.
Billes, the first lead national team coordinator, won the Sunday that Martha Karolyi and his party had performed as an honorary sign.
It's not exactly right if it's not a good time to look at them at this long run, but it's not exactly right.
Part of the earth's orbital transition is made up of Latin music that will be fully consistent with the practice outside Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl discovered by Boorman's mother who was born as a child when she was younger than her adoptive father and was born in a gym performed by Aimee Boorman.
Since 2013, it has not lost any of the general estimates; it is a series of options that will continue as long as Bill wants.
It was too late for Mustafin to take the lead in two rotations.
Billes' world champion has not been made yet.
He took 15,433 points in the ocean machine and carried it to 15,933 points on the ground.
Raisman was suddenly blinded to him while he was waiting for the last moment, and when Billes was actually writing his vision on a signboard, he put his eyes around the green, white, and blue eye mask.
Raisman's performance was like four years ago when he shared his fourth only later lost his bronze medal in Mustafina.
This time, a 22-year-old U.S. team captain named "nine."
In time, he sent a kiss to the majority of the people after his visit to the place where he appeared to be a suspicious return.
And for 19-year-old Billes, it can be said that the most shared tweet that started this week is now having a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot in front of the serial killer, while listening to music in the car
In the first 10 years of Phoenix's serial killer, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in the car when they spoke and listened to music, according to police reports published on Friday.
The authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis were shot in a car parked on a garage road on the 12th of Haziran.
The report says that the gunman was standing on the side of the vehicle and that he was shooting eight hands with his gun and running away with another vehicle.
The police say these three murders don't seem to have any real purpose because the attackers didn't get their adult files or $2,900 money.
Phoenix police spokesman, Commissioner Assistant Jonathan Howard, said that the investigators of the armed attack had not been involved in the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, seven people were killed in nine attacks in the concentration camps, and two were injured.
Howard, at the beginning of this month, was told by CBS to KPHO, "This was in the area of a house in front of me."
In the late 1990s, Nissan is thought to have used several tools that include black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to explain the evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and that the same killer was responsible for the outcome.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital for injuries and then lost his life.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleh lost her life.
A man who witnessed to her, the police, said that they were sitting in a parked car and listening to music was no exception.
At the same time, the authorities published a police report on the use of an empty truck in three and a half hours before the murder.
Researchers have found mermine kloves, produced a mermite from a column, and identified the mermite particles in the engine division.
The mother of a 6-year-old micro-female patient: "She's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Piccito also loves to sing, play, and of course he loves his mother.
But instead of the screens, there's microbial discomfort in Edmund; it's a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Piccito didn't know about during her pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't want that.
That's not true, of course you want it."
He and his wife told Vincent that Edmund could never know them and that he could not even live.
Some doctors went on their way until they offered me a place to stay.
Piccito said, "The first step is to say that people don't think I'm doing this anymore."
Edmund can walk with a driver's help.
Edmund didn't sit tight until he was three years old or he couldn't get up and still doesn't talk.
But he's slowing down at some point of return.
He can walk and build his bike with help.
She also likes to play and sing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund used to say, "Sing me sing."
Piccito, CBS News told him, "We teach him sign language."
But it's not a sign language, as we know, but it says that Edmund has faked his own signs.
Microfecials may arise from a variety of circumstances; there may be a genetic condition such as Edmund and may be caused by infections caused by such viruses as Zika during pregnancy.
Signs and symptoms of disease can be very different.
It's early to tell how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected by this situation.
Piccito remembers the emotional burden of uncertainty about the future.
I was wondering what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know that.
Actually, I haven't been waiting for anyone to tell me about the illness for so long.
But Piccito will be in a position to provide reliable advice for mothers of children who are deprived of birth for Zika's sake.
He's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Louisiana has been running the rescue teams of rain and water presses in Mississippi.
In Louisiana, the rain and the widespread water pressure led to the election on Friday, with the waiting for more rain until Saturday.
The National Air Status Services reported that in the north of Louisiana and in the southern part of Mississippi, there were dozens of water flows, and that it was dangerous after the heavy rains.
Louisiana Valisi John Bel Edwards said that government officials were constantly involved with local authorities and that they were on the way to support areas affected by the situation.
The Department of Internal Security and Emergency Status, Mike Steele, said he was in demand for high water vehicles, boats and superpowers.
Steele said it was only for Tangapahoa Mahalles to be asked for superpower.
Most of Louisiana's sun will be used as a water press until Saturday.
The air condition service said it could rain up to three or five inches in a field.
In southern Alabama, there was a water pressure on Friday because the rain continued in the mobile area.
Both of them are expected to reach record levels in the Amite Nehr, near the Baton Rouge near the Comite Nehri and Denham Springs near the Amite Nehr.
Presumptuous Alek Krautmann said he could leave a lot of houses under water in the coastal areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the water pressure in the Ascension Mahallesi posed a threat to the flow of water from the Maurepas River.
Liverpool, in Louisiana, was already in the vicinity of the Mississippi State border at Tickfaw Nehri, the highest level of 9 in the morning.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from the water pressure in Amit and Wilkinson's disaster in Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and widow's son, was among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) usually said that water from Beaver Dersi, 400 feet away from the house rose rapidly during the night.
He said that another son of a bitch who was sitting next to him was following him.
Hansford said, "We woke up and kept coming to the water."
He was coming to me.
The wife told Hansford that this was the highest level she'd ever seen here for 48 years.
Hansford said that he and his family were disabled and that he was the only one who could handle it.
Hansford said the third of the emergency workers had saved a large, military car in a way that saved them and had taken them to the airport station on Friday.
Krautmann said that as the rain rains continued, the water press "slowly spread" and the authorities thought they would order it out.
Krautmann said a visitor near Livingston reported that there was a rain of 13.75 in the morning from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday, the country has been in a high-level state.
The authorities, the rain and the floods, said that there was a need for the rescue of the people of Tangapahoa Mahalez and the graduation of schools in five schools.
A woman in Tangapahoa told CBS that her mechanical member said she was under 200-year-old water pressure.
Peacekeepers were taken to the two churches that were to be held there, but these are under the water press right now.
Mahalle's secretary, Robby Miller, said that 72 people who were lost because of the high water of the people and seven domestic animals were saved.
In the town of Amite and in the city of Hammond, there were open spaces for people who had been trained.
He said to himself, ‘When they are about to return, they will be allowed to return home.’
In the Hammond Valley of Tangapahoa, the high water was almost completely closed in two rows, and there were restrictions on receiving water from residents who were trying to keep their homes and businesses away from them.
The city director, Lacy Landrum, said, "The most important water pressure we've ever lived was in March."
It's going to be like this.
In Mississippi, Harrison's accident said that the water continued in the Rupert Lacy Corppez River in a swirling manner.
On Tuesday, she said she said that she had some water pressure in her house, but for Friday, she said that I had not yet received any notice.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water in places I've never seen before," and he added, "and there's still rain."
Mahaj Brown, aged 6, saved his life from Philadelphia attack
Police reported that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this is the second time a six-year-old was shot in town this week.
CBS Philadelphia identified Mahaj Brown's grandmother and grandfather.
His grandfather and grandfather Brown said that he had more than one bullet in his body, his stomach, his legs, his arms and his body, but that he was in the hospital only when he was brought to the hospital.
His grandfather Delores Melendez, in his speech at the station, "It was so painful, it was so bad with little dogs."
I can't believe this.
He was listed among those who protected his child in the hospital and passed some operations.
The family told the station that they were waiting to get better.
The first class would start at my local first school.
Brown was among the four who were shot in the Germantown area.
Both of them were shot at two men at 32 years of age.
CBS Philadelphia stated that one of the men aged 29 was critical and the other two victims were stable.
The station reported that one of the 29 - year - olds who was critical of the situation and that one of the men was shot in front of a car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the wounded was attacked.
Detectives said CBS Philadelphia could have shot more than once.
The scene was full of mercenaries in the form of various weapons of attack.
Looks like it's definitely been a long-term encounter.
There were giants on both sides of the chain and removal.
This also shows that more than one gun attack has been found and both of them are active," said Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi to Philadelphia.
He lost more than one house and vehicle in the region.
No arrests have been carried out and the police have been informed that they've hacked the security cameras.
A six-year-old girl was shot by his arm with a gun in front of the house playing in the West Oak Hall on Saturday.
He's still looking for a suspect during his recovery.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This year, I gave this name to the Olympic Gymnastic Team, and there's more than one reason for it.
First of all, since 1984, I've been involved in all the Olympics, and the U.S. has never been so printed before.
The second is: The team has three enthusiasts that inspire many girls with different ethnic roots: Simone Billes, Gabby Douglas and Laurent "Laurie" in Hernández.
Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian are proud of everyone.
Team, it doesn't look like America at all.
At the same time, it strengthens the presence of black and Latin women in the upper classes of the race.
In the past four years, the first woman has always been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby 1 and 2.
It's a powerful thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and supported America.
Now, Simone Billes, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who are the world's three World Championships, will be able to testify to the extraordinary performances of the three world champions, who are the masters of science.
On Friday, Simone became the fourth American to the back of a gold medal won in the women's general appreciation.
And his team friend Aly Raisman won the gold medal.
We know this race for the best time, but it doesn't look like this in the country's diagnostic courses.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to get a place in the Olympics.
The reason why they are "son of Five" is that there will be only four Gymnastics in the next Olympics team, and this will be the last year that Marta Karoliy will be practicing.
But indeed, a highly competitive sports and gymnasium is working on the education, travel, form, competition, hotel fees (for trainers, gymists and families) and on the private gym clubs that are supported by many more fees.
Most of these colleges will support these operations. They take place in the existing state of the state of the state.
These clubs need the only place that scientists can learn from, and the families of scientists need a rich and long-term support.
Simone Billes' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's partner, Maggie Haney, have been training these athletes since they started gambling.
We don't think that there's a lot more expensive and accessible scientific education for a number of young girls from Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I built my own gym class 20 years ago.
In my constructions, we conducted free and low-cost, national and international seminars on the 15000th of Harlem.
In the month of the year, we will expand to Detroit (the place where I grew up) in order to learn about this wonderful Olympic race and to give young people the opportunity to take advantage of it.
It develops the strength, gender and coordination of the body, and provides discipline and decision-making characteristics through frequent scientific processes.
This combination, health, school and business success, offers long-term advantages.
Thousands of young girls will be inspired by this team, and that's a great thing.
I'm involved in sports activities, especially for girls.
We're really going through exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison are grateful that they have shown the strength of the Olympic team to Simone, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, and have motivated many young girls to be healthy, strong and successful young women with different background plans.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the assistant doctors decided to continue the seizures
The audience hoped that the agreement with the English tabulators would lead to the end of the dispute after the agreement had been concluded with the United Kingdom officials, but 58 percent of the assistant doctor involved in the game refused to play.
In October, Mr. Hunt explained his plans for the application to show that NHS "no one's property" and that it would harm the staff and the patients later.
The first assistant group, the doctor group, was introduced to a new agreement on changes in working hours and weekends in order to improve my care beyond normal hours.
BMA's assistant doctoral committee president Dr. Ellen McCourt said in his office last night: "Asian doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement; in particular, they think that this will contribute to the present labour crisis and that they will not be equal to all doctors."
The first doctor should only be able to make progress within eight weeks of the re-examination of the first doctor group, and on time to complete.
The efforts made by BMA to resolve the disagreement were faced with the lack of interaction and, in some cases, the lack of voicelessness of the government.
This is a development that is seen despite Jeremy Hunt's promise that the door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to move right away, remove the offense, and listen to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
The assistant doctors claim that they are ready to step up the slow pace of work without doing so.
At the end of the month of Nisan, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were held, the nurses and speakers had to look at the doctor's position on the grev.
The audience hoped that the agreement would end after the agreement had been concluded with the members of the United Kingdom.
BMA wants to make the deal better for 54,000 assistant doctors last week.
NHS Executive Director Daniel Mortimer, called for the intervention of any emergency doctors.
Mr. Mortimer said to them, "Grev will not solve anything, but it will cause anxiety, frustration and anxiety for the sick, the caregivers and families, and the families who are still in need."
Over the past two months, we have held meetings with the Assistant Doctors Committee, and we have approached the Health Department and other authorities in a timely manner with regard to their concerns about the Ombudsmanship and the Diplomatics.
It was hoped that employers, important issues - division, educational excellence, educational skills, conflict-related fraud, educational licenses, and educational opportunities, as well as gender-related issues, would be able to pass on a positive message in relation to, and to act in accordance with agreements with BMA in November, January and May, England, the School for Education and Health.
A drug that can eliminate the risk of heart disease with 2 £ per day
After suggesting that more people be given more in the longer term, thousands of heart disease can benefit from a two-pound medicamental medicine every day.
The ticagrelors that prevent reconciliation are reducing the risk of crises for people with heart failure.
It was a 12-month period of heart crisis and a reduction in prison or another crisis risk.
NHS monitor, NICE, suggested that this be given to people over four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS monitor, Nice, suggested that it be given people over four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year about 14,000 people in England face a heart attack and four of them face another crisis or crisis.
The cause of heart crises and floods is the formation of plates on one another’s walls.
If the plague is broken, it could cause a heart attack by slowing down the blood flow.
And if you get out of the pit, you're going to have to slow down your brain's blood flow.
There's a higher risk of someone who's been hit by a crisis before.
This risk, created by the United Kingdom firm AstraZeneca, is reduced by the Brilique trade name Ticagrelor, which is created by AstraZeneca.
The NICE scale published today suggests that 90 mg of ticagrelor should be given to humans for 12 months and that it should be administered twice daily with aspirin twice daily for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the existence of effective secondary treatments, four times the heart rate of those who experience heart attacks is another heart attack or failure, and generally the consequences are devastating."
The fear of resurrection is that if we are too much on a person's quality of life, we can create an effect.
The evidence is that the use of tagagrelor in combination with aspirin is an important factor in reducing the risk of heart crisis and physical risk in people who have experienced a prior heart crisis.
We are pleased that the Ticagrelors are being offered as temporary, and we are pleased that thousands of people waiting for this to be used have increased their treatment options.
Since the information about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelo is limited to three years of risk of cancer, the risk of breast cancer is now limited to treatment.
The PC culture has increased the volume of music in Muslim territories
Former President of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was arrested for misconduct following the government's report last year
Just as today's corrupt government report shows, the political culture of truth has led to an increase in the widespread lack of music in Muslim communities.
Former Captain Sir Eric Pickles, because of the "extremely speciality of ethnic origin and religion" he challenged the police, electoral observers and the police, and the police.
The former secretary of the community and today's inadmissibility, said that the electoral movement would have to be subjected to such a bad order that police would have to be allowed to vote outside the gates to protect the fearful voters.
The voters recommended that they find their identity beside them in order to prove their identity during the vote.
In the present situation, it's enough to say the name and address of the selection.
The report recommends that people be chased permanently during the voting process during the voting process in order to avoid double-smoothing.
Sir Eric said those in jail should be better protected.
He was called to provide better access to the Foundation with regard to the decisions of the Committees and non-official committees or working groups.
"It is not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the corrupt and materialistic culture."
The report was prepared with the permission of Downing Street after the music scandal in East London.
In the past year, a special election court, an illegal and illegal application was decided to take over the duties of President Lutfur Rahman.
The Court found that the Most Beneficent (Allah) has "disquieted the religion of Islam" and that those who follow him have been misled and have hindered them from the crimes of Islam (Islamic Monotheism).
The expression is "a religious duty on the part of the Muslim believers to vote for the campaign."
It was the end of the game until 300 or the use of the fake identity, that is, the use of the music as if it were something else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the country's general state.
He warned himself, in particular, about the abuses he was using by mail, where it was claimed that the elderly Muslim community was applying pressure to the island by giving them their own choice.
Sir Eric found some steps to set up the voting system to prove who the people are and who they are.
The report included the following words: "In particular, evidence was provided that certain ethnic minority groups had been subjected to pressure to vote in favour of women and young people, especially in the indigenous communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"There have been concerns about this kind of behaviour, based on the ethnic origin of the State and the extreme anti-religious nature."
Sir Eric, in his post-moving position, made 50 recommendations for the organization of the system to prevent political activists from operating for the "yyy collection" purpose.
The report quoted by Theresa May is also calling for the speeding up of recording controls to prevent the transfer of the electoral book and the lack of social assistance.
Whether the selection is to be shown in front of the show-off before the voter is played.
It's a constant use of a person's fingers after a vote to prevent a person from playing twice.
Whether systematic controls are performed on the person's conformity to determine whether he is fit to give a vote.
A 3-year limitation application for claims made to the game to be used by the automatic mail client.
Policymakers and activists are required to take care of the collection of video games and videotapes sent by mail.
Police, they're not supposed to be able to shoot the bells around them.
In 1983, the Law was amended to make it easier for people to be intimidated by the National Assembly Act.
Whether to take a photo of it in the voting booths or not.
The only requirement for speaking English is in the voting booths (except Galler).
The strengthening of the training that the person's election has taken on the rule of entry into the office of the electorate alone.
Sir Eric, the Tower Hamlets has made the Police Organization undeterred by the fact that no crime has been committed in the context of the Tower Hamlets.
"The election court has decided that there is no place to blame for misconduct and illegal activities committed for the sake of the mercy and representative of Lutfur."
He was found guilty on the basis of a series of necessary doubts, according to the nature of the inconsistencies.
At the same time, he also acted on non-active "smooth-signalling controls" in the electoral records departments of the building.
Sir Eric told them: "Was Tower Hamlets' annual court decision a warning?
Our son, although he has the mountain that the mother of parliaments has given him, may be the cause of this concern and the spread of the secret electoral fraud and the rejection by some institutions.
Be crazy about Kate's bicycles and Rio Olympics' other famous adventures
This week, Rio 2016, who held the Olympics, returned to the crazy for Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a French biker who proved to be an exciting symbol of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only sport that pays attention to celebrities when fighting for gold medals; at least social media thinks so.
That's why we've seen Rio Games and our screens with respect to all the famous performances, the F.C., Hollywood.
Audrey and Kurt: A.D. Boys' School Team member, Brady Ellison (left), compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's bicycle belt, many people in the translator's environment have shown that Leonardo DiCaprio could be twice the same.
The U.S. Human Rights Committee member Brady Ellison took photos that reflected the similarity between the star of the Affliction's film.
And the boy admitted to being told that he was like Leo since he was a child, which made him aware of this madness in the social media.
Brady said to Huffington Post, "I don't think it's a big deal, except hair and hair."
'That's why I think it's a relief.'
London is one of the most popular comparisons in 2012 and there is no doubt more similar to this year: The incredible similarity between the public actor Greg Rutherford, the long-term English athlete, Neil Patrick Harris.
Russia's geneticist Aliya Mustafina has been described as one of Cuba's major and significant eyeglasses.
And in the ocean, South Africa's star Cameron van der Burgh, it's been compared to Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Changes: This user means Nathan's Home movie star is an 'athletic version'
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other for similar reasons.
The Russian team's silver medalist, actress Annalynne McCord, has the same brand-faced and brown hair that Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team has described as "Joseph Gordon Levitt" as having an athletic version.
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have one hundred charts and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user and others are so happy to see this similarity
A remaining theory: This user thinks that this pair can be a reason behind what it looks like
One Twitter user was moved by the happiness he felt about "the fact that the Internet thinks the rest of the Internet is both Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter."
He actually has a football star in the U.S. and an actress playing in Dexter.
Among other popular comparisons, Kerri Walsh-Jennings takes place with actress Laura Linney, who has almost the same smile as that of another gold medalist, Gabby Douglas, who is a young Athens film star named Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic Spiker apologized for the fact that China's face had died like a domuz
Byron MacDonald's 14-year-old analysis of the fourth quarter of Ai Yanhan's 4x200 m free competition, was very disappointed by CBC's live Olympics.
The Canadian press organization, CBC, was forced to apologize for the fact that a 14-year-old woman from the spy had gone to China's face as a little drink and died in the fight as a domuz.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought that the microphone was closed when the women started explaining their thoughts at the end of the free race.
CBC's spy team was told that MacDonald, who was involved in fighting 'enk', was quoted as saying, 'The 14-year-old Chinese had a little weight loss, my baby'.
He was so excited, he walked away like a bad dream and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China's Superintendent Ai Yanhan (14) concluded the second leg of the battle in the course of 1:57.79, making it possible for Canadian Taylor Rack to close the gap between Canada and China within 1.61 seconds.
Canadian explorers moved quickly after they arrived at surprise with their tones and language
Emmett Macfarlane said "CBC spy said that a 14-year-old face died like a dog."
He wasn't smart, he didn't realize you were still in the open.'
Chinese Ai Janhan, 4 x 200 m in the Freest District War, was identified as 'the little Chinese man in his 14 years of age, my baby.'
Byron MacDonald's comments were published very hard and fast on Twitter, and many of them were self-evident.
Twitter users couldn't stop themselves when they heard how innocent Byron Macdonald was acting
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Vay #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and why you look like all of us.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who published the CBC, apologized for MacDonald's speech, saying, "We're sorry for the information published about the dispute."
These were not the words which were chosen without knowledge, and you are sorry for what happened.’
CBC has been able to apologize at least 90 times as much as tweeted.
Another spy, Scott Russell, had to apologize for MacDonald's name.
CBC later copied it to Twitter on 90 of his complaints about MacDonald's concerns.
The network has published an explanation for the quick request for forgiveness.
We would like to express our total regret about the fact that these statements have been made and that they have been published.
In the evening, we quickly apologized to our supervisors, to our social media, and to our followers.
We'd like to explain that Byron's positions were, not his face's personality, but his performance.
In addition, these were highly inappropriate and unsolicited words, and Byron was very sad at the end of what they said.
On Friday, after lunch, he apologized to MacDonald and said he didn't want to be in a personal assault.
He said, "I want to apologize for a situation I've been doing after the night's party."
"I wasn't about the face person, but about his performance."
"I don't need any more words, I didn't want to be rude, and I'm so sorry."
Primark client's address to a woman who tried to smoke in the middle of the store
The customers didn't know what to do when a woman took out her clothes to try to visit a store in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, the woman looked at what it looked like, took it out, and retraced it.
He went on to look and then tried to have four in-house stores in Bouverie Place, Volkestone.
Before the woman was rehabilitated, she was a Primark store located in Bouverie Place, a shopping center in Volkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the store at the time, said after trying to get her secret woman into the store, she said she was dressed up and out of the store without getting anything.
He said to them, "The people have not believed in him."
He stopped in the middle of the store and took a drink from the wine, dressed on his sweater and his pants.
'He didn't try to find a special place to do this, he was in all his disrespect.'
'Everyone looked at him when he went out, and he realized he didn't like the trip because he had a re-heat.'
She tried three more stores until she decided she didn't like anything and then she went out of the store again.
"He didn't seem to be concerned about those who were watching him, and he didn't think he'd buy any more of his visits."
Ms. Davidson (33) who lives in Kent said, "It's a shame to think someone else's wearing a clean, unsanitary bike and going home."
This happened after Saturday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "I think that after that day, the person found his clothes and took them out of the store, that's a good situation."
'When I took a new trip home, it was really bad to think that the other guy was dressed and that he was coming to me without raining.'
A Primark speaker said, "Primark, 9 August Friday is news of what happened in our store in Volkestone."
It's made out of sale.
How can you protect yourself against armed attacks by Krakw Maga
The outside world is very dangerous, but this video that Dailymail.com is supposed to help you be more secure.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, head of the Central Krav Maga Federation, New York, to learn how to deal with the nearby armed giants.
Before you want it, you're getting closer to it. This video will show you how you can turn it into a curse.
Mizarachi says, when you're around the back, you're going to see the first thing you have to do, turning your face around and saying, 'Let go of the fire line'.
Then you'll shoot your face with the gun in front of your arm and between your shoulder and your shoulder.
Then, when you blow your bows, the pain of the attacker will go out to two sides, and he will take the gun from his hand in this direction, and you will strike his face with the edge of the sword, and with the edge of the sword you will remain on his face.
A similar technique is applied when the gunman approaches in advance; you turn the gun around and the attacker won't fire.
At the same time, you will draw your weight out of the sky and turn your weapons against him, and you will come back to him with all your might.
Is he coming down to the ear?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But if you are not a guardian of the Qur'an, you will have to pay the equivalent of your money in order to avoid all kinds of harm.
Travelling Ian Wright sent the language to Europe's worst places for travel
The English journey carried out a serious test of forgiveness and learning by throwing some of Europe's worst and worst places.
The server and travel writer, Suffolklulu Ian Wright (51), received a Euro banknote, a Piccadily Circuit floor, a telephone call from a train tub, and a telephone number in Russia.
He used a lymometer to show himself and us what kind of work he's been doing before he lied to each other.
But the attempt to become a movie called Inner Strength, The Lickhaker's Guide to Inner, gave some surprising results.
While the idea of lying in a train using thousands of people's symphonies is very distasteful, there's actually a lot more bad bacteria in the muffle pool.
Mr. Wright has met doctors and surgeons throughout the journey to Europe about the growth and health of mide bacteria.
And he did not create an effect except by the evil of his mouth.
Mr. Wright, the world has been known to test the stability of its brain by eating strange and strange things.
This task, in a wide range of general trains at train stations, has certainly tested the system of forgiveness
In the film about this, he said, "I haven't had a lot of attention since my childhood, and I've had so many things to say from the soil, the sun and the water."
And during the film, she clearly proved the reason for this.
The only thing he refused was a bad public toilet in Russia.
The version sample showed the lyminometer number on the 4,000th floor.
If it has to be compared, or if it's new, this number must be below 60.
But when the number of lyminometers was less than 60 or more newly burned, it was a Russian public toilet that refused to lie when it came out of 4,000 degrees.
Mr. Wright and Fin ice cream producer Valio, showed the number of bacteria in different places such as bananas, the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong
He said to himself in the movie, "Come to be one of the worst things I've ever noticed in this bathroom."
There's nothing worse than this!
I'm not going to lie to you because you're mad at her.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, Finite milk products were prepared along with Valio.
The company has provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gephilus, which contains vitamins C and D that help strengthen the medic bacteria and the sorry system.
The Valio's Floods, Fruit Waters and New Categories Division, Chief Vice-President Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We really wanted to bring something new to consumers.
It's something that's interesting and will explain the benefits of probiotics at the same time.
Finally, we've made a lot of crazy brainstorms that the idea of "let's call Ian."
They claim that concerns about mid health have become a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking about products, we just wanted to put the products in a much larger bond; the good and bad bacteria around us daily, the importance of health, and the forgiveness system.
A global health concern is coming up, and with this documentary, we'd be able to give more information about this situation in a more appealing way.
At the same time, I think the film shows that we have a wonderful understanding of the exhibition!
Tom Hakala, director of the film, added: "I'll tell you this; Ian, if I lied about some things I wanted to lie about, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I'd lose my respect for him."
Of course, lying to some things was easy for Ian, but some of them were very hard.
I'm glad we saved some of these bad lies.'
A study conducted by Valio in 2015 showed that 84 percent of the participants associated lactic acid bacteria with medi health and 58 percent claimed that they used at least the products containing lactic acid bacteria.
The Maganda family, before the age of Saltash, founded the Cornwall social account
One Hungarian family lost $50,000 in social affairs that they had been investigated for fear of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and his wife, Shawn Trebilcock, were fired from the account at Saltash, Cornwall.
When they were forced to leave the country, he was surprised to see that the court had not been reformed.
And there were in the walls great signs, and the roofs of mine were fallen down, and the foundations of the houses were fallen down, and the wall was burned with fire.
Family is now distanced from the account and is considered to be benefiting from special placement options
Donna McEvoy, managing director of Cornwall Houseing, said he was afraid that the situation would not be saved.
He said to them, "This is what I think is really a bus for the people here, and people don't have to live this way.
There's a lot to do because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons, and according to the police, it was like fighting in the streets with baseball bats, fear of the neighbors, drug use, drug trafficking and the overcrowding of drug dealers, quarreling and disbelief.
In June, a decision was made for Skeldon (47) named in the Kira Agreement.
Finds old wastes in many rooms in the house that seem to be falling
In the past, drug trafficking was removed from the place of government raids.
The neighbors said they saw what they were fighting in the street and that the police were busy.
Cornwall Housing, after 11 weeks of recognition for their deliberate movement, forced him and his wife out of the country this week.
It was a pleasure to meet with relief neighbors who said that their lives were turned upside down.
One said, "No one was in his age."
We've been living with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You can't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because the middle was so quiet, we weren't used to it!
They're gone. Everything's gonna be great now.
Cornwall Houseing's neighbourly duty to do this said Adam Fitzpatrick didn't cooperate with his family's local authorities.
The family lived in this house for 20 years, and the government was called by the police.
The social account was dumped on the ground by garbage and old games
He added: 'It's really embarrassing for the author and for his family to handle any responsibility; it has always been the last choice Cornwall Houseing has made for him.
This was a very difficult view because the conduct was too high and that the neighbors were afraid to witness to their actions.
I highly appreciate the efforts of the team, Devon and Cornwall Police forces and the members of the community who are particularly interested in informing us.
I hope that this development will be understood as a message that will provide a measure of comfort to our neighbors and will not be welcomed by antisocial behaviors.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons who lived in the country at different times, but he was 20 years old.

In 2014, the police collected more than 70 grams of iron, tartars, special items and $1700 of cash.
Skeldon, for sale, was sentenced to a fine after he admitted his guilt for finding a drug in Class B.
In 2013, Lee Skeldon, the son who died in a car accident, said he was going to use the money to get a funeral.
After she left home, Tanya and her wife found out that she had a special issue in Plymouth now.
Most of the houses were on the walls of the building.
The police said they're going to work with the owners who follow the rules of the sale.
Angela Crow, from Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, also said that he had a warning for other owners who continued to comply with the rules.
He said to himself, ‘This is a message for those who think that they will be free from any miracle unless they meet any miracle.’
The Devon and Cornwall Police forces who will continue to work together to protect their communities will never be pleased with the crime and antisocial practices.
Tourists in Porteciz were told to pass through the airport immediately
The inhabitants of Porteiz, the eastern tourists of Aveiro, have lived their lives happily
Portuguese Air Force aircraft named P-3C Orion flew from low to low
Air forces have indicated that this is a training flight, but security risk has not been established.
It's when tourists start panicking when they fly across a flat hill.
In dramatic visions, the army is sighted almost at the contact level of those who are on the eastern coast of Aveiro, in northern Porteiz.
Tattlers came to their feet because of the noise of the jet engines, not knowing what was coming to them from the clouds, so they were worried about what they were doing.
The case came to Costa Nova, near Aveiro after noon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few speakers who participated in a social media video near the dramatic plane, said, "Two times he went really low and seemed to hit a point."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was making excuses and I swear I felt like I was going to fall on the plane."
The tourists at Aveiro's school came to the conclusion that the flight from the darkness began to fly in the direction of me
The Portuguese Air Force explained that today's P-3C Orion aircraft is being trained to identify the fishing boats on board and that it is the only way to control them.
He said that the recent closure was due to a lack of visibility because of the storm coming from a powerful fire, but the air forces were alarmed that no one was at risk of safety.
This letter, the powerful fires that had been shut down in Portpezi's mother-in-law caused a lot of damage and caused the death of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces said that the pilot's presence would have to be slowed down by today's speeds (slow noise and noise caused by strong fires)
Flight training was in flight and wanted to identify fishing boats from the pilot as part of the training
The London girl student who participated in the ISIS was killed in Syria
Three English girls from London, who left London last year, were told that Kadiza Sultana died in Syria.
The lawyer, Akunjee, said that his family had received information about the death of Rakka in Syria a few weeks ago.
According to the ITV News on Friday, he is thought to have died in a Russian air raid on the Rakka region, where his group was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and her family said that she was planning to flee from the country that was damaged by the war and return to Britain.
Akunjee, "We hope that this situation will threaten to undermine the risk of going to war as a nightmare for others and as a matter of fact, and cut people's minds on this choice."
In February 2015, two girls from southern London went to Turkey to a plane and then to the border with Syria.
She told Sultana's family that she was married to an ISED warrior in Syria and had been widows for months.
Reid indicated that Clinton would not leave Garland as High Court Island when he was elected.
In the Senate, Democrats leader Harry Reid said he believed that Judge Merrick Garland would be elected President Hillary Clinton as President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The citizens of the Senate, President Barack Obama's name in March, was to stop Garland's approval process.
Senator McConnell, President of the General Assembly, said that someone who will take the place of former High Court Judge Antonin Scalia would choose a new one.
Reid, in a visual conversation on Friday, said that Clinton believed that he would choose Garland and that "the reasons for this."
Later, a speaker named Reid said that he didn't really talk to Clinton and he was in speculation about not showing him the name Garland.
He took Garland and said that Clinton's team didn't want to "break up the situation" by making a new choice.
Garland, Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of State of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who prevented Garland's name from being shown, the Republican president of the island, Donald Trump, were "the traitors" and "the brides" of Donald Trump.
He said it wasn't appropriate for Trump's job.
"Treats indicated that as far away from my calendar as it's for the high-level women."
The Treats report is working with photographer David Bellemera on the publication of a calendar prepared by the 1970s by Pirelli.
But instead of famous and famous people, they are working to find new generation group models for the 2017 Îlham Peril Festival.
Treat's president, Steve Shaw, said that it was different from the old Playboys because "play is for men" at the beginning of this year.
I'm doing this for women.
Obviously, he believes my calendar is the same.
Shaw said, in the section on the calendar press, "Like men, women need to return to the organization of classic expansion, which does not change the way women look in order to be able to look at these images peacefully as a source of inspiration."
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a good job.
Models can be sent as translators or can participate in open meetings in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinil target: Who really are the marketers?
Average age, only men love wine.
Allow us to tell you that this brain is based on the truth before it can be found in the wonders of the universe.
According to YouGov, the return of the plaques, which are a very common topic, is not a result of the Y-ray of the newness that created a physical object, but of the middle age nostalgia.
In the near future, the sales of vinyl albums are mostly between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, we're the lowest of 18-24-year-olds.
At the same time, it is not only the combination of curious people who have a sensitive preference; older vinyl receptors usually prefer to keep their feelings in mind (%56 and %53) and those who are lonely (%69 and %66).
And what about yourGov's results?
This blog, if there's a news on TV, in most of Soho's cameras, while walking with a bright gray band dress, there's a lot of noises when it stops and my hands open and says something like this, "Let's get a look at that."
Then let's take a look.
Soho's centre is still in the state of low-speed and unsustainable air-conditioning (some of the buildings where independent sellers are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchaes) and some of the expert disc stores.
I probably wanted to stop the camera for the next piece, and I was trying to tell them about their age and emotional circumstances, standing near some of the different men in these stores.
From Sister Ray (number of two young women, three middle-aged men) I've been following Reckless Records (number of eight middle-aged men, probably a 20-year-old woman) while I've been on my way to a meeting in London, looking at the store for a few hours after lunch.
I'm asking you a collector.
He says, "I think I will."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates that are placed on the official surface (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow myself to the house) shake the walls of the sitting room.
So many numbers of albums and single collections are a consequence of some of the money that can be spent; now that the money doesn't have enough money, it can buy back what they sold in their youth and in the absence of metal.
He says, "Most of what I've got in my 60s is the end of the 70s, I'm 11 or 12 years old; I'm too young to get it."
The fact that the plak sellers only like to stay, joins in the idea that there is a high chance of being people, and adds, "I don't drink cigarettes, I don't get too much alcohol.
It's my bad mood.
Wez (25) who works at Sister Ray thinks that most of the clients he met were on yourGov profile.
But he also realized that he had created a new wave of advertising from the media, and that people who heard that the fashion came back needed to buy back old plates.
At the meetings I did, I usually realized that in 1998 or 1999, people took out their collections.
First, customers sell their vinyls to buy CDs and now sell their CDs to get the cards back."
This could explain the increase of a certain ageing person who has re-animated the vinyl.
And what about the emotional importance of the plates?
In a store like Phonica, it takes you a few seconds to realize that media stores are like people who are self-sustaining people.
According to Wez, some grown-up customers, especially those with no contact pay system.
Some of those who hold vinyls may want to escape from the digital world and remember their peaceful youth memories.
Wez says, "Sometimes it's possible to fill up an empty space or see material as a kind of congruent."
I have this because I'm a collector, and I think it's a lot of people.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social service officers," says a working friend running from a CD.
A report made in Nisan revealed that 50 percent of the vinyl album areas we've been in last month have not yet heard of.
At the same time, the survey concluded that there was a gap that the% had never used, and that 7 percent had no plates, and that there was no bottle sales of vinyl.
At this bottom of the news, I've probably been the last of a worrying look at a series of bossa novels.
It's an element distinguished by Jonny (42) who worked at Sounds of Universe.
"One came to me recently and said, "I don't have any plates, but I want to get a radiohead plate to put it on."
This doesn't represent a large percentage, but it certainly undermines the state of existence.
Get more, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have any toys."
They're not the old ones, young people, the last ten years, they're making new contributions to this.
Now I see that when I get to Fopp, who's divided into almost all the pieces for a violet, it's very different.
In the 1970s, there were men, tourists, young boys, and middle-aged women.
Even though the last part of Wild Beach (Vild Beach) that is above the atmosphere, sex-intensive pop is spreading instead of relaxing tea, it is good to see the difference between customers.
No one looks particularly like it's just trying to solve the psychological traumas that upset them for over 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), she's been traveling to Fopp for a few minutes and looking at the plates on my desk.
He just went out to look at the viruses instead of making a deal.
He says he doesn't have a chance to make a CD collection because he doesn't have much.
It's very complicated.
It's easier to listen to music than to computers or other images, but it's more beautiful than wine..."
I don't know how to explain it, it really doesn't look like it.
A magazine that inspired the new generation of vinyl content: Urban Outfitters.
I've been looking for a group of young girls in the area for a while before a discussion about buying a cross-platform game with their father and daughter.
Soda Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's plates have a full margin; no plates for a medium collection; a mixture of modern and class.
No one looks at it; maybe it's just because it's a decoration goal, some of it's so high that it won't touch.
It's totally "a sacred vinyl".
But the curious thing about these things can mean that the sector will earn more money and send the less client to Soho's cores; there's not much to complain about.
It's not surprising that more money and more time is spent on more important things like a demographic group with more money and time.
But my findings show that at least the results of YouGov are true in Soho's record stores; the number of women who are more, actually, in the record of the record or in the translation forums, are not included in the collection of women and the vinyl content.
These people probably work very often at school or at offices.
These people certainly don't escape from the eyes of a 30-year-old television server looking at the eyes of middle-aged men who are not aware of anything.
Greenland, the longest living animal ever - video news
He explained to the people that Greenland has the longest life among the world's mammals.
Julius Nielsen, who was thought to be between 272 and 512 years old, said that he belonged to a woman at five meters long.
The French court rejected the offer to destroy stores in the jungle camp
A court in France rejected the offer made by the Calais authorities to fire a store and restaurant in the jungle camp where thousands of residents lived.
In the trial held this week, the Calais authorities found that the total sales of the product from tobacco to the people in the state camp, cut off hair cuts, or sold 50 cents (40p) against tea or several euros from basic food should be reduced by 72 yards.
Calais Valiggio was warned that these places should be destroyed because they created a parallel economy without paying taxes, and because they took risks with fire and hygiene.
The relief groups explained that the lives of the stores and restaurants were important to the court, that state-supported organizations and other groups were not enough for the more expensive food in the camp.
Well, finally, stores and restaurants have been warned that they are supplying food free of charge to those who need it.
A court in Lille stated that there was no legal ground for the restriction of persons working in the 72nd grade store but that the concerns of Calais Valis can be "not fully understood."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that there is a much greater role to play than to feed people who live in "very dangerous neighborhoods."
He said that these areas provided peace-building points for the volunteers and volunteers.
The book Coffee, which is one of the most dangerous places in the camp, offers 200 drinks every day, offers English and French classes, and offers advice on litany for hundreds of non-recorded children in the camp.
The man over 170,000 signed a petition to protect this coffee for children.
In a letter sent to Guardian, this closure was meant to "be an insult to some of these eight-year-olds."
Two well-known organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des migrats, on Friday, came to the idea that after more in writing, there were 9,000 of them in the Jungle camp (the highest number up to today).
After the sixth grade in Fiji, Britain won a gold medal at the seventh rugby champion.
The dramatic progress of Great Britain at Rugby 7's Championship, at the end of the day of Persembek, ended after the 43-7th anniversary of Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji has given the first Olympic gold medal in each color for the race, the foot, the edge, the support, the speed lines, and the strength of the bow.
After the update, Britain received the third silver coin of the day as a very little less than a welcome prize, and it can now be proud of the efforts they have made in the 7th opening tournament of the Olympics in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
By the beginning of the day, seven to five additional people may have found them at the end of the afternoon.
But still, there was a Fiji in this form, even a group of 15 people.
Although it is unlikely that Great Britain might find comfort in thinking that at least one British gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's main coach, Ben Ryan, a Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game in Adelaide's seventh champion.
This time, they lost only one.
Although this is painful, the progress that has been shown is really surprising.
Fiji has made a huge start, players have become famous about Britain's collective engagements.
It was like running between a series of mobile buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and it was 5-0 in the world's series of champions, moving from the coast of Osea Colinisao.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another number of fakes from the right side.
The game was 12-0, and the Great Britain couldn't touch any more.
Mitchell's great adventure, like the mountain, led to the third shooting of Leone Nakarawa, but it just slowed down Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalu made a right-hand count, and Great Britain fell back 17-0.
When the first half was only a minute, Nakarawa made another number from the beginning.
Later, Vatemo Ravovovo, a number of violent British cases, ran through the line.
With this number, the score between the circle is 29-0.
When a team set up to play the 7th Fiji champion, Great Britain was still trying to learn the basics of the work.
That's the way it's going down.
Great changes took place between Britain and Fiji, and it ended up in Fiji, and for the first half, it was not a good development until Joshua Tuisova was able to compete with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton was in an experiment for Great Britain and tried to count from the left side to make the score 36-7, but the players were in the hands of the South Sea States singing, dancing, and singing.
It was really hard not to hear Fiji's physical approach from the beginning.
Maa Vilame also found the latest additions to the Fiji game, which doesn't have to be sucked in the last few minutes.
When the storm struck, the Fijians began to celebrate and set the way for the bedroom of their bedroom in a way that struck Britain.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji invaded Japan in half finals 20-5, and Great Britain faced a tough half final encounter with South Africa, and Britain took the lead in a single number.
Kyle Brown, the first half of South Africa's team, and the second half of Dan Norton's lead-in-the-way operations.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who took his first 15th place in England, was guaranteed a silver medal with his great treatise and gold medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coaches' battle against cancer
There will be no more sensitive gold medals in these games, and this also makes an important meaning.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the memory they won was far more meaningful than they had won at Lagoa.
There were three voices on the board, however many of the two men who drew their wings, and the first women who reached this level in England this year were the first women to go back to the second gold Olympics.
Their jurisdictions were so clear that it was their 39th battle of incompatibility.
We see two wonderful sportsmen on the ground in the snowy landscape, but this vision doesn't fully reflect the purpose of the frog.
In the back of each gold medal, there's a wall that's made up of a desire or a desire to achieve this difference, and no hand was effective to trainers who knew that they would not live until they were able to see this day 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched and went.
I was caught with cancer of the kind that could be treated with surgery, and they did it.
If they don't, they're going everywhere.
This would be a very bad situation.
It changes your outlook on life a little bit.
He spoke specifically to Williams in April 2013.
She was very lucky that she was able to start treatment in early 2014, but she wouldn't know if there was a true statement in these cases, but she'd be able to get the most out of it.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better.
It was an encouragement to me.
I was in the hospital, and I walked up to nine feet in the field, even though I told them I had a few steps to take.
That's how it started.
It's a journey to itself, but it's a little bigger.
After Zafer, his mind was in Williams, who had been talking a little bit more every time to get his own concerns over it.
Stanning, who was the leader of the UK Summit and who had gone to Afghanistan earlier, said, "I was in a state of emotional exhaustion this week, maybe it's a little extra, but it really means a lot."
That's what it means to me and Helen, and how much Robin and I work together again.
I spent three years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't have. That's why I want to thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better man or a better coach to work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose five years of competition.
The second is that they have a tough rhythm that they won't reach.
The power of Stanning and Glover, the last 500 metres between New Zealand and Denmark, has not yet been cut.
We've been trapped by that mother.
Helen used to sound like 'betray, watch time'.
It's really important not to go away.
We did a good start, and we weren't trying to do something incredible.
We didn't expect air files to be released today, but we just wanted to win the race we went out with good wings and we did.
The second will call a year before he decides what he will do in the future.
Glover's got a wedding to share in next month, and his own TV show and Steve Backshall's wedding.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy it.
I didn't mean to say it was my last fight.
This would make a lot of pressure.
I realized I was an Olympic champion in London for six months.
It was very new and I was very stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
That's a much better feeling."

Bulgaria 8 The First Period of Inflation Explained Values
According to international statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was %1 in the month of Haziran.
This is the highest value that has been seen for years (from 2012 onwards) that we've spent the year together as a positive value of 0.2 after the month of October, this is the first value that we've seen on the figure again.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was %0.8 when compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In 2016, when Haziran was compared to 2016, it was 10%.0, i.e. monthly inflation was at 1.0.0.
From the beginning of the year, the rate of inflation (compared to December 2016 to mid-2015) was -0.2 and compared to the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and 2015 -0.2.
In 2016, compared to the previous month, the following group of drug addicts were found to have increased prices in groups: drug and alcohol - free drinks (%1.7), access (1.8), entertainment and culture (%6.3), restaurants and hotels (%1.2), possible goods and services (%0.3).
The clothing and shoes (%2.2), furniture, household equipment and routine care (%0.5) and health groups (%0.1).
Drinking and drinking alcohol, as well as all alcohol, confectionery, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels; prices remained at the same level in the information and training groups.
Snapchat "Anime" effect, shaded as a basic cartoon
Snapchat says it's inspired by analytics for this filter, but some observers say it's inextricably insensitive.
Snapchat, with a mercury tool, enables 150 million rounds a day to be able to play with his peers at absolute level by changing the reality of the user's reality.
You can turn yourself into a mother, a dog or a Roy Lichtenstein character.
Merches are unique and unique tools that make up more than 30 million new inventions every day.
The wrong steps are fast in the memory of the people.
Snapchats faced accusations that in the past supported the black classing of the application or whited cell tons of beauty.
That's why, this week's party, users, because of the Lens that makes them look ugly, ugly and fat, some add-on companies have made it a "Asian mask" for the Asians.
And they were wondering that the company did not indicate a bigger issue about diversity.
News and stories were published on Thursday with The Verge and Motherboard news and one day she heard Snapchat removed the property.
The company found it in an explanation: Mercek, not to be a cartoonist, was prepared for anime characters.
But for observers who have had a stroke experience, this bear reminded them of painful steroids.
Other people generally refused to compare analytics.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art teacher and tweeted about the photos, said in an e-mail that she was "the most painful and disfavor."
"It was difficult to argue when the effects of the filter were compared to the harsh core caricature.
And this shows that the filter is not only a basic mask, but also a basic mask at a humiliating level.
Snapchat, it's not the only company that's involved in cultural triggering mechanisms.
The American culture, the organizations' meetings from their rooms to Hollywood and all of the devices we carry, seems to be in constant conflict with diversity and captivism.
And what Snapchat chose can be expressed in the way that large young kittens who are more likely to be in a higher profile expectation than others.
When Katie Zhu, 25 years old, created a small dropout for a user on Friday, she said, "It's much harder not to see any of these things as normal."
On Friday, a product manager and engineer working for the Media decided to delete the Snapchat account, and everyone called.
In his article for the media and the report on the phone, he expressed his belief that the conflicts with the Russians had caused differences in the work of Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu, the majority of the company ended up with a label saying: #SnapchatiSilin.
Ms. Zhu, an American from China, said, "They can make such decisions because there are not enough differences between individuals, or even people who work there and people who do not feel so secure or comfortable that they can talk to themselves."
Other observers share their views on this complaint that Snapchat had left behind in the big area of Snapchat.
The company does not share the figures on the diversity of its staff by attacking its private company status.
On Friday, he refused to share the ethnic roots of Snapchat's staff, but according to a statement, the company was in a position to raise a business in order to focus on populations not represented in sufficient order shortly before.
Ms. Zhu, frankly, indicated that Snapchat's account would be closed and added, "I wonder if you don't need more users like us to say it's not true."
The Congress Panel, Military Authorities, said the ISED passed
In a report published on Friday, a Congress panel, the United States of America, stated that the United States has presented a better picture of the conflict against the Islamic Government in Iraq and Syria.
A report by the Royal Military Services Committee, the Committee for Justice and the Defence Award, which was prepared by a working arm of the community council of the Sub-Committee, stated that the U.S. Central Commission changed its assessment of the Islamic government.
Centcom is a military leader in Central Komuta, Tampa, Fla. and a military commander who controls American military operations in Central and Central Asia.
In a report report, the following statements were made: "The results of the patents approved by the major Centcom leaders are usually more positive in drawing a picture of the facts in the context of the U.S. field than they have shown in typical progress."
"What is in Centcom is unacceptable; our fighting associations are suffering from poor analysis of the high-level decision-makers."
The leadership failure in Centcom has reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report of Central Komuta also provided details of the remaining challenges in 2014 and 2015.
As far as the great Obama government is concerned, there is no clear evidence that the authorities have ordered the change of reports, but it is not clear that the analysts have felt pressure from Centcom leaders in relation to the ban on the creation of the known Islamic Republic of Syria.
In the report, "In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press were more positive in terms of volume, brain and congresses than in terms of fiscal events."
For example, a Centcom official stated that a major military attack on the return of Musul clearly could be launched in an early period by Nisan or May 2015.
Musul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansa's Community Ombudsman, Mike Pompeo, said in an office, "This is particularly clearly understood after months of research."
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the U.S. Central Commission's most important executives have been working on the results of the mandate to launch the risk posed by the ISIS in Iraq.
The community, after learning that the analysts have raised concerns about the administration of Islam, has created a working tool.
As the attacks continue, the report published on Friday will be followed by much more extensive rumors.
There is also another Centcom's promotion of jurisdiction, which is carried out by the General Court of Defence.
The members of the Committee on Democratic Affairs of the Kingdom have also published their own findings on the basis of some of the results of the Community's work force on Friday.
The Committee's Democratic President, Adam B. Schiff, said that "it has created a very significant period of time in assessing the credibility of Centcom, DAESH and Iraqi Security Forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Schiff said that this period "has delayed the publication of the results of the debate", led to moral degradation among analysts, and "has not given enough room for debate."
However, Mr. Schiff and Democrats said that they did not reach a point where the results of the White Sarahy's centcom analysts were "predicted or politicalized".
The results of the Congress's investigation were announced on Saturday by Daily Beach.
In August last year, New York Times reported that there was a general investigation of a Pentagon infection following complaints made by the New York Times and Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, as a pentagon speaker, said that the general investigation in one body would not take place during the period during which the Defence Department continued its efforts to report to the Congress.
But he said, "in some cases, the authorities will be in a position to disagree on the complexity of the data and support the health dialogue of the Defence Force with the population on this important national security characteristics."
Research will alert the public to the fact that the U.S. bombing operation in Iraq and Syria did not continue in the past (this is a dispute raised by the Security Authority more every day).
However, the charges made last year have raised the question of how much the Central Commission can trust military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Despite the recognition of many analysts by President George W. Bush, Centcom's author of the creation of a small power in Iraq, he began writing an article that said he did not think enough after work in 2003 and that he had been discussed for ten years.
Mr. Hooker, at the same time, has played an important role in the interests of the Islamic State.
Despite Mr. Hooker's explanation of the general public over the past year, the authorities have indicated that the air raids against the raffins in the Islamic Republic of Karaborsa have resulted in that terrorist group's financial resources have not been significantly affected there.
However, the discovery of The Times did not go out of Komuta, as The Times indicated in July.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, then, was shocked to add that the statement in the Senate was considered to be the final positive assessment of the war by many legislators.
General Austin was born in Nisan and replaced by General Joseph L. Votel, who took his place at the Central Commission.

It's like there's a five-foot game that's gonna need a permanent stick in the mind, but Bam (27) said he wasn't sure he had done the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not from people who keep their hands.
What you know is that the Americans are sharing their first group with Brittany, who went on a week-on-week tour of the Olympics before 4-0 and after Thursday after Japan.
The United States of Great Britain and the United States will face the final game on Saturday.
Both teams won the finals, and the game, the six teams, will determine who's the first and who's the second.
The team that first completed the group games will not face a little longer with the powerful team in the Netherlands, which is the leader of another group when the finals begin.
But after Friday's game, the Americans created a chance to make wonderful progress here after the London Olympics between the last 12 teams.
Bam was in this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 years old when he first took his horse hockey shoes, and when he was 16 years old, he became the youngest player of the team.
He lost his 2008 Olympics because he couldn't get into the last frame.
Then came 2012 when he and his teammates didn't have much on their way.
The following year, an English coach Craig Parnham was assigned to work, and things started to change.
Bam says "a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change."
We're not working like London anymore.
We've been through my turn.
On Thursday night, Bam, he picked up the first number on the first day of the first day of the battle.
There was no chance in the Indian tournament, but the team was able to defend itself in a surprising order, showing stability to the third flower that Bam had entered around it as 1-0.
He made a long race from the left of the palace, and then he turned around and threw the ball into the street, and the Americans went through 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales, he's got the last shot in the middle of the fourth floor.
This was the first game that Jackie Briggs, driver of the United States, who allowed each other to go in the first three stages.
It's open.
That's right, Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place now," but it's about how good this place is at the end of Saturday afternoon.
Trambolism in the Midst of Olympics
Wherever you are, regardless of the hour, the Olympics continue.
The activities in Rio de Janeiro represent a full recovery and work, and it's as if it's never going to end or run away.
It's like an avalanche of the Olympics from the face of the Olympics, from there to the gymnasium, to the triathlon.
Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos can't watch TV without hearing anything about the crash between them, can't read the newspaper, or listen to what your neighbor said in a coffee shop.
And Logan Dooley has.
For the first time, Mr. Dooley may be one of the names that are shown in the prime hours of the prime time, including TV advertising that tells you how you feel about the Olympics.
But Lake Forest, from California, Mr. Dooley (28) is fighting for gold medals in the Olympics.
The Olympics don't explain every activity at the same level.
Far from the center, there are some sports that are not universally known on the island: airstorms, mudmintons, tekwando.
The sacrifice will always be with us, if it's for a long time.
But if I have to tell you what I love most personally, I'd like to pay attention to the secret size of the trampoline.
No matter how much the trampoline in Sidney's games has been known as an Olympic activity since 2000, the few people I've asked in the past 16 years have not realized that this is an Olympic track.
This could be a regional area.
The United States had never won a medal in the tournament, and it had not won a competition in the finals until 2012.
Among the men were Chinese and Russian, and among the women were Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan will try to protect the gold medals they bought in London this year.
But the title of the trampoline is taken into account as a serious activity, so it may be thought that you belong to the school of the Olympics rather than to some unknown audience.
I have to admit I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in it.
There is a comical potential (such as a series of films created by an endless stream) but it also involves two kinds of gymnasiums and the surface of the road that leads to a single race.
The word "trambolin" comes from the Spanish word hand trampoline, and this means "tramplen."
Champagne trees are almost 30 feet high in a large trampoline, and they want to make a series of moves (birk, picke and salto) before they fall on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are valued for their performance, their violence and their "flight period".
In Rio, 16 men from 17 countries and 16 women will fight thirty-two athletes.
Make sure the most of the most frequent advances in the Olympics.
Believers should go back to the end of the golden rounds, and in some cases they should go back, with further, faster and higher moves up.
They're not just after the finish line or the beginning wall, they have another hard line on television; the world or the Olympic record.
It's a great effort to be honest, honest, and even superior; it's enough to put an observer in their sight.
But that's one of the little things that I've got to do with watching the Games.
Trambolin, it's all you can do.
Those in the trampoline will move straight up.
Their goals are not moving forward.
He pulls it up straight, looks like an astronott, he jumps up, he jumps down, and he goes up again and again unharmed.
Of course, it is not said that there is no requisition or force but that there is no damage to the work, no loss of distance, just to be caught in a tragic way, such as time and place.
A Olympic competition can be as serious as it is.
The women's sequences and then the finals will be scheduled at 3:00 a.m. on Saturday, 13 a.m.
NBC will be released every two days after the end of the session as a block from 14 a.m.
In the middle of the foolishness of the Olympics, they promise to be seen in the general garden in silence and a wonderful moment.
And according to The Wall Street Journal, we can say that if the United States is going to raise a male athlete just to watch and object as men have suggested just a short time ago, Mr. Dooley's new adventures will be expected.
For a long time, in Ethiopia, U.S. Secretary of State, "One Women's Protestoda"
Anti-Virus Protests in Ethiopia
Political reformers in Ethiopia faced the government's violent approach.
The witnesses say that a lot of protestors have taken deadly weapons in a fight with the police.
Are you going to Ethiopia?
In the past ten years, one of Africa's most diverse countries has been a healthy security for the West with its rapidly expanding economy.
But the government against the protesters in the months that we have been doing in the past has spread the country more and more throughout the day.
Just last week, thousands of people were in demand of basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government did not feel very bad about this.
The witnesses said that the police had shot and killed the gun-fighter on a large number of counts.
In protests that we've been thinking about since the end of the past year or since the beginning of this year, there's a need for young people to hold their hands against a wall.
The United Nations, at the highest level, wants the human rights authority to make a separate investigation at this time.
Rashid Abdi, project director of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: "It is always difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward."
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is one of the highest countries in Africa, and the exception is to be assessed by the West.
America's military and humanitarian services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats to Somalia in the former part of the country, and there are very few countries in West Africa who have seen this unique aid.
Ethiopia's economy is growing in an influential way.
The submarine has been repaired in an active way, and President Addis Ababa has a new banana train.
And the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
As far as Ethiopia is concerned, the country's best example of democracy (which is always under the pressure of human rights groups) was very limited, and the teachers were being actively suspended.
Most of them were sent to prison, jailed, killed, or thrown into the remotest parts of the village.
But this may be about changing.
Seyoum Teshome, who is a university student from Central Ethiopia, said, "If you don't give people the honor and you don't give them a choice, these things will happen."
Youth is completely protesting.
A girl in protest.
There are so many complaints about the strength of the coalition that it reports.
After the election that we made last year, he took the party and the petitioners, the last column filled by the delegates, and now he can control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, in the month of Haziran, hundreds of people have lost their lives in war, and there are still hundreds of refugees in the border with Eritre, who have lost their lives.
Analysts fear that, in the years that we have spent, like the Oromo Freedom Head or the Ogaden National Freedom Head, separate groups will be re-armed using this training.
There have been several factors that explain why the pain is now spreading under the surface over the years.
The first seems guilty: smart phones.
As the mobile phones spread and the Internet service became available, communication began to be made only a few years ago through the large number of Ethiopian social media.
When the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter, as it did in protest times, most people were able to communicate with Internet-based servers who hid their locations.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathered in this way for protestors.
Second, there was also a growing conflict between the Oromos and the Amharas, two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia.
The Oromos and the Amharas are not normally safe.
For a very long time, the Amharas had been taking advantage of the Oromos, who were Muslims and who lived in the right ways, from the mountainous regions of Ethiopia as a Christian.
But that's the same thing.
An Oromo leader, Mulatu Gemechu, said, "We are moving towards cooperation under a single summit."
The biggest protestors were seen in Amhara and Oromo districts.
Most people think that Amhara and Oromo, Ethiopia, have been dominated by members of the ethnic ethnic group who have created around 6 percent of the population, and that military, political, commercial, and ethnic groups are being wrongly dominated.
The third reason why Meles Zenawi died after his insatiableness.
The former Estonian leader Mr. Meles has been head of Ethiopia for 17 years until the death of an unexplained disease in 2012.
He thought it was a tactical spell that everyone could not see.
Analysts say he's expert on not detecting the first signs of his innocence, and he's not satisfied with his comments and influence.
The dispute analyst Mr. Abdi said, "The existing regime does not have this basic knowledge."
Ethiopia's new president, Haelmariam Desalegn, was elected in ignorance to fill Mr. Meles' place.
Instead of Mr. Meles from the Tigris region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariem is a guest.
Analysts say the security services that the Tigris control their own won't be trusted.
As a result, more and more blood was shed with fear.
Ethiopia's latest experience of this kind of conflict was the post-war riots that thousands of analysts have fought in 2005.
In the past, as far as we've been concerned, many protesters have been killed, and this conflict period has gone much faster.
Masters of education, Ethiopia's leaders, have been trained to plan video subroutines, such as the new flagship train, and to make significant progress on record progress in combating poverty.
But it is obvious that this has not stopped the increase in the identity of the anti-Ethiopia government.
And that's a dangerous and ethnic thing.
Last month, protestors in Gondar, an Amhara city, attacked the business that the Tigris owned, and Tigrian hatred is increasing in social media.
Analysts, protestors say they leave other terrorists in the United States and the West in a strange situation.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the top for non-human aircraft flights in neighboring Somalia, but it was said that it had been shut down a short time ago.
If the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to break up this volunteer in a region that is currently broken.
Mr. Abdi said "This" and added, "It's like walking on a lot of snow. "
Donald Trump explained Obama's idea of creating the ISD as "Agreement".
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, several times last week, President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to remove the last incident in the campaign, claiming that the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.
This explanation raised new questions about the establishment of a clear communication with the people of the United States of America, the President of the Community.
At the same time, the creature who created this burden also made a strange point about the fact that they were trying to explain the brain that it was designed to protect it.
Mr. Trump, after a meeting on Wednesday night in this proposal, he was shocked at the fact that Mrs. Clinton had actually built the ISIS on Friday.
But on Friday morning's morning's post on Twitter, Mr. Trump said he was just in an interesting statement.
The message showed that Mr. Trump had taken a step back a day before he said he was serious about this crime.
Hugh Hewitt, director of the radio programme, said that when Mr. Obama tried to help him ease this trend, the President of the Community did not believe in this island.
Mr. Trump, the last time he was trying to change the camp's room after the raids, he went out.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made talks this week about the economy in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to return to this matter again.
Speaking again on Twitter, Ms. Clinton said that he would increase the taxes and find that he had often found himself talking.
Mr. Trump used to defend the threat.
Right at the end of the month of December, when the Russians had staged a scene that suggested that Ms. Clinton's e-mails would be attacked, he said, "Of course I have said it in a way that makes sense."
It's close enough to make Mr. Trump's policy-making restrictions enforce and take back where he needs to.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert in both languages, who was also used by both figures, said: "It's a way of making "explaining" in a way that allows the message to be "explained" by those who support it."
But at the same time, he knows these brains and he knows that when you look at them from different angles, it's not as clear as it would be to be filtered.
In the past few days, I had a lot more attack on the air than it was for the general election.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday revealed that Ms. Clinton was in the vicinity of North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and that there was a lot of competition in Florida.
As long as Mr. Trump is unable to apologize for the terrible things he has said, he is guilty of misleading or misunderstanding the words of those who have offended him.
But in the last few months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes, which has been too much focused on him, leave his loyal supporters in a difficult position to support him, no matter how exciting their efforts are.
Former New York City mayor Rudolf W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the island on Friday with CNN.
When Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton asked about their rights towards the Islamic government, Mr. Giuliani said, "Bence is a political act."
As a result, there was a small organization that was unknown before Obama, and it was completely wrong to find them, and that was why the soldiers were expelled from Iraq.
Most of the former Communists are trying to defend the extent to which the Obama government, who has made Ms. Clinton's foreign occupation, is unable to cope with the situation in the Middle East aggressively and why the ISIS is growing.
On Friday, in the face of the rally to be held in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse every word of his media of touching and acting against him.
He said, "They can't do this."
Some Democrats said that it was evidence that Mr. Trump was not suitable for the president.
Repeat with us at coffee point Greenpoint, not starting with files
The Verb Cafe Wi-Fi, an old well-known place in Williamsburg, has been a source of great coffee for over 15 years, but it has not been connected to the Verb Cafe Wi-Fi.
Of course, he didn't deal with the prices at Bedford Avenue store.
In 2014, Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb, sells soap in the form of a cup of tea.
The inhabitants of the region came close to saying that this was the last city to be visited.
The author Molly Crabapple Twitter wrote: "I'm changing New York, but I can't believe that the CBGB is gone yet, and Chelsea Hotel is released and Verb is now a soap store."
But it's the city of re-creating as long as New York is changed.
Last November, in Greenpoint, a Verb Caffe was opened in less than a mile from the original location, in the north.
It has a new Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connection and accepts a credit card, but it protects some former employees and the like.
The coffee's good.
At the beginning of the new Verb, the long-term employee of the former captain also finds Cisco Rodriguez, the owner and general manager of the new site.
In 2001, he joined Verb and stayed until the end.
A client said he'd be thrilled to do this when he offered to finance himself for this new place.
Mr Rodriguez (36) left much of the same thing.
Verb uses the same distributor for sympathies and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even old Verb's lights were used here again.
But Mr Rodriguez said he wanted to get some different experiments.
Added new puzzles.
It is also represented by such materials as capillary and chocolate.
There's esmer-pirish cases.
Coffee's no longer doing beer service, but it's depicting fresh fruit water.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he realized that former defenders had begun to come in a decisive manner.
He said, "Many of our old friends didn't happen with prices in Williamsburg."
On the day of the Passover, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Ms. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and often goes to Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he didn't give up on this road.
He said he'd been calling for coffee for a while after the verb closed.
He said, "I realized that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb."
Now she started to drink coffee again, but the day before, she chose a new cheese mixture, which was a new addition instead of the ice coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another advocate, has been on his way to Verb since 2003.
He went there before work, and he always gave him the same gun.
He said, "Every day, I would cross the tree, and I would enter it by myself, and it would be a strange thing for me to do every day."
The photograph said Mr. Rodriguez wanted to change and add new items to the menu.
Today, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular driver, but sometimes he makes a little change by adding a pair of shoes to his boots, eggs, and beans.
Mr. Rodriguez said that he wasn't in the bathroom where he took his place.
In fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make a special soap for Verb using the coffee that the coffee was colded.
Mr Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents were mine.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Lehche and said Mr Rodriguez would soon find a field that would cure the menu so that the new neighbors would feel better too.
There are other advantages to my new subject.
The local fruit-water store wants to bottle and sell frozen coffee.
There's a chance that caffeine will spread to the building in the end.
It's enough that a new Verb exists for most customers to find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client, and he was very upset after the space was closed.
When the new space was opened, Mr. Whitt said he felt that he could get some coffee in the house.
He said, "I should've fucked this up."
In the "A Square Mail" of the Depression of the Crisis Times
In March 1933, shortly after sitting in the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for dinner at Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, who was one of those who fell to his knees, loved to eat the fresh fish, like the bread of Maryland.
The menu of that day was much more motivous: the dominates greened eggs, potatoes cheese, and also a sweetly hand poding.
Jane Ziegelman said, "This was a way of putting up with people who were suffering from depression."
And Andrew Coe added, "It was a message to the Americans about how to eat at the same time."
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights, food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book was about "Chop Suey" in the United States, and Ms. Ziegelman was talking about eating the rest of his life in the evenings of the Netherlands.
The new book they're working together and the "A Square Meal" that will be published by Harper on Saturday tells the history of American food in the Great Buffalo.
Since 1929, when the crisis has begun to rage, they have met with a guest at Eisenberg Sandvic Buffet, located in the Flatiron region.
Ms. Ziegelman (54), while selling cream cream and oil sandwiches, preferred Mr. Coe (57), India, potatoes and cheese.
Both of them found it appropriate to discuss the routine of the warlord's routine.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "People would be very popular."
He had the earth's fruit, the grain of the wheat, the fine flour.
These were made of something wet and soft.
Think of the place you're eating until you're hungry for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got his face on.
He said, "He must have sat in the middle of a man like a bird."
In the years before the crisis, especially in the affected areas, the challenges in America were like a clear hole.
Women cook food for men working in the fields and served freshly baked potatoes for breakfast, breakfast, and evening meals.
1. In the World War, the Americans sent food to hungry Europeans. "A Square Meal", explains the history of the way out of being a center of wealth at a time in the world.
Mr. Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it, said, "This was a time when food was a very special moment for Americans."
The new bogey region was equally concerned about the fact that secret foods such as somnolants and grapefruits had become my main concern, according to Ms. Ziegelman, "was a great way to appreciate the rest of the vegetables" so that the branches could hide the closed ingredients under a creamy sauce.
He took the place of fresh fruit, which is softer.
Over the years, it's been found in the American food center, and it's become a fully distributed luxury.
I've experienced interesting conflicts for calories and five values and I've had a lot of feelings of tattoos or general muffin understanding.
Ms. Ziegelman, when doing research on the book that includes the charts, prepared a full-fledged food for that period.
Mr. Coe said, "This evening meal wasn't a favorite party."
Ms. Ziegelman supported this: "It was true."
There's no part-point with the hair dryer.
This is an important feature in most households' economy.
Between 1923 and 1943, the Federal Home Economics Office, also responsible for the household economy, led by Louise Stanley, led to the fact that the country had never had its eating habits before.
The articles and articles have encouraged women to be "sharp" in journals and magazines, and have promoted the struggle to turn into delicious foods such as airy cream spaghetti.
"A Square Mail" is a visit from a very interesting background.
The results that President Herbert Hoover gave to the government's open-ended relatives, such as the offer of pasta.
As the simple Iowa farmers of his own farm boy passed through their food on one side, they ate like millions of intellectuals who turned out to be on the other side.
Mr. Coe said, "He liked to eat his favorite dishes in Europe, like salted fish."
He ate his meal in a dining room with almost all the gold.
He's so far away from the truth.
Eleanor's wife might have made the same mistake if she didn't encourage him to be an example to his wife, President Roosevelt.
According to the book, Ms. Roosevelt's job was to hire a non-profit assistant in White Saray, not only "the most delicious foods, but also the most carefully prepared tobacco."
After the country re-entered on its feet, many of the methods of feeding during the crisis were left to one side.
Ms. Ziegelman says that it continues to be a form of appropriate understanding and preparation of the calorie and the food of science.
Two times, when writing the book, Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits indicated that she had learned a lot - for example, that food was never waste.
Mr. Coe said, "The recipe for eating really scared him."
Ms. Ziegelman, she said of her old mother, "She has really sick people."
There was a cremation of bread.
After the tobacco collection in Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe produced a sweet cake they had prepared at home: it's a strong sweet meal eaten by President Roosevelt at dinner.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "It's called a broken set," and added the most frequently applied number, which was to give a favorable name to the holiday fares.
There was no broken cream; we're just dry, a little sleep, sugar, water and sugar.
Everyone was so excited to find a cup of coffee.
It wasn't so bad in a strange way.
Mr. Coe, he took his second and third.
He said to his wife, as if he could be able to handle it.
Hepatitis C will receive Gilead lawyers' fees in battle with Merck
According to the U.S. District Judge, Gilead Sciences Inc, a medical doctor, was entitled to receive legal fees for the hepatitis C patent case carried out by Merck & Co Inc.
After identifying U.S. Judge Merck's false testimony and other foreign applications as well as a number of wrong behaviors, Gilead, Haziran's major success in Gilead was reduced from paying 200 million dollars for two Merck patents with regard to Sovaldi and Harvoni.
On Thursday's session, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that he had the right to be prosecuted for fees incurred during the trial of Gilead.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can improve more than 90 percent of cancer patients.
Dova, Gilead and Merck, indicting each other, are suspending the claim for ownership of the state of laboratory works for the active substance of the medicinal products of Gilead.
US-supported forces have expressed that Membic's control has been completely controlled by the Islamic State
On Friday, the group speaker, the US-supported forces, the last Islamic government in the city, also said that they had completely seized control of the northern Membic city near Turkey.
After a group of soldiers left behind in the city of the Democratic Forces (SDG) in Syria was separated, the city was cleaned up.
SDG announced that Sharfan Derviš, Routers, of the Membic Army Council, was released from civil service in 2000 by his soldiers.
He said to Routers, "We're only doing cleaning work under our control now."
Clinton's family won $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax in 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton explained on Friday that the Democratics won the President's island and our wife received $10.75 million last year and paid federal tax at 34.2.
In 2015, the Clinton family provided $1 million for most of their organizations to be the Clinton Vakfé, the former president Bill Clinton won about $5.3 million from his speech fees, and said that Simon & Schuster had received $3 million for the publication of the book that he had received for the period he had spent in the East Bank.
Clinton's best friend, Senator of the U.S. Secretary of State from Virginia, Tim Kaine, and his wife, Anne Holton, released his 10-year-old tax agent.
In 2015, the federal tax rate was 20.3 per cent.
"The Hills continue to set the standard for Clinton and Tim Kaine's financial leadership," said Jennifer Palmieri, a member of the Clinton campaign.
Besides, Donald Trump is hiding behind false accusations and taking steps back to explain the tax charges he had made earlier.
As far as laws are necessary, it is a possibility that the U.S. presidents' taxes will be publicly handed over to tax officers.
A business man in New York said Trump and the lawyers, who said that the government's refusal to release the agents, was an investigation carried out by the Commission.
Ian Sams, the task of the Clinton campaign in connection with democratic authority officers, has set up a tweet on "Towards."
On Friday, the Special Agent Michael Cohen told CNN that Trump would not allow it to be published until it was completed.
In 2012, the Group of the Group that included the Group of Presidents Mitt Romney and others of the Community expressed concern about the independence of the opposition, the participation of its members, the employment agreements and those with Russia.
Clinton published a translation video showing that the top-level community has been using pressure to explain the taxes to Trump on Friday.
On Friday, the question was raised in an economic conversation in Michigan.
He said to the majority, "He refuses to do what every president has done for years, and refuses to publish his taxes."
Politico reported that Trump had not paid taxes for nearly two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times section of work was a series of tax lawyers and the accountant's case could still continue in this way.
The federal tax situation has become an important issue in the presidential election.
Clinton offered a law called Warren Buffet, a billion investor, who would pay at least 30 dollars a year for those who won over $1 million.
President Obama supports this offer.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hataway group was delighted to come to Buffett, Trump, where he was active.
Buffet said he was going through the IRS trial and not from the Trump's tax agency, but from the voters.
Clinton published his tax charges until 2007.
The Clinton family now lives in Chappaqua, New York, has paid a federal average fee of approximately 32 hours between 2007 and 2014 and has reached approximately 40,5 percent.
Clinton's family's brain for 2015 is to show that most Americans have only 100 dollars of money.
The most important investment is a low-malarial index investment fund and Clinton's family has stated that their income is $109,000.

The dust red condoms, the pelvis, support the protection of the pellets in Tanzania
Environments in Tanzania use a method that is not used to prevent girls from entering human settlements; they throw dust red condoms on them.
This idea was proven to be effective, and a few years ago, the U.S. Central Security Union, with Honeyguede Vakf and the U.S. Central Security Unit, began to learn about the non-violence of the protection of their homes and their homes and their homes against harming animals.
Most people used to use knives to defend themselves.
The fifth day is the World Cup, which is devoted to the protection of animals.
President Damian Bell, director of Honeyguiding, said in an office, "We have seen that this has changed the attitude of these communities since we have developed the Middle East; now there are more liberals who will be able to keep away from the waves without harming the birds."
The first two steps include holding the last file down and playing the crown.
In situations where this is impossible, it's known as "red-haired blubber."
The dust-cool red bean, which is mixed with a pellets, is placed in a condom with a bottle, and only the air is closed in a way that will remain open to the fennel.
The condom opens with a blast sound when it's hot, and it turns red red in the air as dust.
It's enough for a breath of fresh air to send it to the opposite direction.
The last thing is to use an air bubble, a high voice, and a light blast.
Jewish filmmaker, Israel's phone code on "Talbi" on the Arab side shot out of a hotel in Berlin - RT News
A Jewish French filmmaker, a former French filmmaker, opened his way to the media sensation after he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin had failed to list Israel's telephone code and that the employee had been exposed to Arab clients' "studies".
Claude Lanzmann, from the authors of the "Shoah" document on the subject, brought to Berlin the appeal to the Kempinski Bristol Hotel, with an open letter from the German public body to the FAZ.
Lanzmann, recently tried to find Israel on the list of the telephone codes that the hotel provided recently.
But the country did not take a place between the states that could call from the room directly.
In 2016, how could Israel be released and destroyed in Berlin, the new President of Germany?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol, representing Israel calling on its own call centre.
The filmmaker told the hotel's reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that he's making a joke.
The hotel's secretary said that this workshop was taken by the Kempinski-Hotels administration.
It's why you're lying under this move, why the filmmaker's got a lot more upset.
According to Lanzmann, he said, "Most of our people wanted to remove the code of Arab and Israel."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German mayor of Israel Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described this situation as "a great shame."
This situation has left us in the dark, and it's really surprising.
This is really a shame.
It's a lot bigger than it's been in Germany and in a hotel pool like this.
That doesn't have to be explained.
We're waiting for the hotel to come out of this."
The case was a major wake-up in the translator's environment, and people were called scandalous.
Some accused the Campinski Hotel of "screaming" to the demands of Arab customers.
In another letter, he replaced the phrase "You should" with a statement that was found in the Kurfurstendam village near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel's report, Otel quickly started these charges by saying that this was the end of the "inconsistencies" and by saying that it was the end of the case.
Suddeutsche Zeitung stated that one of Kempinski's representatives said, "There was no direct order for Israel to be included in the quick list of calls."
And now he says they've added code.

And it might even be the word that the season's team's going through the end of the season to the middle of the summer.
In such a situation, even more direct flights can be said to the driver.

They're also in danger of being headed for Turkey.
I'm thinking maybe we're going to make 700 grand.

President Aziz Annual and Management Building, the Club's Finance Coordinator, also held a meeting by Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic size of the meeting was thrown into the table.
The agreement with UEFA was reported to have been assisted by Yelkovan in financial matters in order to maintain the "yearly injury" level.
A contact was made with Pereira's representatives.
He was ordered to finish his mission.
2-2.5 MILLION ON EURO
There are some points that have not yet been resolved on the matter of money, so it was said to be done today or tomorrow.
Pereira and the team went out with the team today because they didn't make an official statement.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
But the F.Bhaçe was said to provide a digital deal under this body for the pessimism.
If you pay Pereira's loan, it's gonna end up between two and 2.5 million euros.
Pereira's gonna pay for a month if she doesn't see it.
If he makes a deal with a team, this will be canceled.
Yeah, he finally went to Pereira and signed a big revolution on the Fenerbach side.
In the war with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani was given the city.
And Robin van Persie was barely rescued.
I think I'll be very happy that Vitor Pereira's gone, that our administration's going to get better.

FETEL President told Gülen's possessions
The Adana Community Commissioner for Terror-Technical and Organised Crimes, who are not involved in FETÖ/PDY investigations, has been charged to the FETÖ/PDY High Court on 17 suspects.
Fettullah, a number of figures, decided to arrest the judge for the crime of 'Don't Teach the Church of the Church', the court case, and the trial with the Sun, and the witnesses who were with him, concerning the Life Fighter, the Kemal Elibal and the Cemal End.
But it was decided that the court procedures would be carried out for 4 seconds for a fireman who had not been arrested and who had not come to trial.
Adana 2. The severe Criminal Court decided to hand over to all the property of Fethullah Güll, the Emir, Kemal Elibal, and Cemal Enducu's property, which was found in a foreign country with a view to ensuring that the case was inexorable and therefore not accessible to him.
The court's decision did not include the transfer of car and air traffic vehicles, all kinds of rights and acquisitions, valuable insurance, the share of the company involved, the property of the buyer and bank accounts.
Hüsein Gülerce: The collapse of the Sun depends on 3 feet
Hüsein Gülerce, who was in charge of the entry of the FETö, was found in the quicksands of Hüseyen Gülerce.
The lines of Hüsein Gülerce's explanation are:
As I thought they were going to go to work, I wrote this in my last 5-6 months, "they can love but they can't do it in the command line."
I didn't know two things; first of all, it's open and deep, for example, the 8-year-old commander's command subpoena and Mr. Chief of Staff.
The greatest fighter of the Lord's people has taken care of when choosing their beliefs, but the most important secret of these is not seen.
They're two faces.
"It's not a work that can make an artificial plant like FETEL." One of the most important evidence is that it's so deep.
He's actually getting support from the CIA.
CIA, this guy got his hands off me very early.
Mahmut Övür 2014 says that in 1971 they met Fettullah Gülen at the home of the Vehbi Koç.
It says the most people concerned about these things in that period is the closest time the CIA's relations with the MIT and the CIA are.
That's how our armed forces paid the U.S. personnel' wages, and after they didn't remember them, a man came out.
When do we learn that in 2014?
After that, Mahmut Bey didn't even have a false explanation.
For example, Justice Max is arrested, isn't it?
Who's interested in that?
Adam went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before work, and he returned two days ago.
Justice Max has gone outside 109 times since 2002.
When you bring all of this together, it needs to be investigated; now that all refugees have gone to the United States from March 1999 to the United States, all of which have gone to the United States since March 1999.
It will be seen that they went to Pennsylvania with a visa.
But the actual results can be identified by the CIA, and in particular, many people have been sent to the U.S. in security from those who need to be raised from security.
There are Wikileaks documents; it's building a funeral and it's doing joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago, there was work to show these connections to the CIA.
I said Fuat Avni was a holiday in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works in the capital is working for Fuat Avni.
But that's bad, and that's what happened to Pennsylvania, and that's what happened to the CIA.
The collapse of Gülen is related to three feet down, one of which we say is that it was a friendly community, and there are people in deep hypnosis who say it's still the film of Erdoğan.
I was saying three feet, a base.
The stealing of questions, stealing, stealing rights, this base was very expensive.
The other two feet; political support, international support.
International support still exists.
The only thing that's going to break political support is the fact that the MHP administration's accounts have been taken by FETU.
15 After Tammuz, he used the "FETZ" and the "Shit" to open the eyes of everyone.
"I don't do it around," said a number in the morning.
He says to me, "My Lord, these girls see a lot of different dreams, they send me, and I've just read it, because it's not right to act with dreams."
And there fell a voice, and a voice came out of the city, saying, The man that spake in the midst of that city was Barbaros Kocakurt: The people of the city had a dream, and our messenger had a dream.
There's a police town in Nusaybin.
According to the information received, a long-distance gun fire was fired by terrorists who were carrying out their duties in the D.C.E.

It's operating in the area.
No TV broadcasts have been detected and no trace was released
On the night of October 15, special televisions that play an important role in the prevention of entry to work continued to be published in Turkey as a technical staff member.
That's the charming Akkay Akka...
Akkaya, who said that during the reading of the announcement in the TRT, the release of the release of the release of the press, "I took care of everything, thinking that my friends were the city of fire that opened up from helicopters."
They wanted me to put a gun on my head and stop them.
I just shut down local TV.
Then I made them leave the building, telling them we should go to the tents.
I spent 20 minutes in a section where the antennas found them.
He said, "I've cut some more cables here, but I haven't touched the streams."
Before the workers could stop spreading in Turkey, Samanyolu brought the TV operators.
These terrorists were arrested by police three minutes ago.
When the workers returned to the building about 1 hour later, they realized that they had continued their TV broadcasts on the phone, and that they had come to the grave at the time of their death, Akkaya told them that they were alive:
That night, I ran your nightmare at 8:00.
That's where we got it.
My friend was an enemy to the e-government and power system.
About 2100 hours ago, when we met to drink water, the helicopters flew over our heads to make low-flight flights.
There were a few more aircraft flying around the helicopter.
We saw their lights.
They were probably human-made aircraft.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
I was 11 years old, and for the first time, I was looking for an order because I saw a flight so close.
There's a movement going on.
When we looked at the news, we found that the tower was closed.
At that point, our general manager, who was in security, advised his friends to come to the building.
When we went to the system to get information, we learned that all the releases in the TRT had fallen.
The TRTs have been suspended for 5 minutes.
I called TRT's mom's house, but I couldn't get it.
Our control station said the TRT releases came back and began to read the information.
Our Assistant Director General, Halil Growlski, asked for the release of the TRT publications immediately.
We've started working to slow down the spread of TRT 3 from the channel.
We've heard the President's Biennial Year has been said to have a "dangerous."
Our commander's command to stop the TRT was put in a little bit of a psychology.
We cut the TRT, and we heard the helicopter sound after a while.
We went out, the helicopter that set up the system burned all over the place, and everyone was split apart.
We're hiding a building behind the back.
We were all 12 people.
After we got back, soldiers from helicopters came in.
A few of our friends have been captured by soldiers.
We went out among them so that they would not leave them alone.
At that point, I saw that the general manager was arrested and beaten.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
One said, "I'll shoot one of them, they're scared."
Then they all sat in.
The commanders started shouting, "Who's responsible for this? I won't ask again."
And when we heard them say, "Let's hit one another," we thought, "We don't know about the country, but we've got a call, to stop the TRT."
So there's a resurrection.
I felt like I was leaving my own life right now.
I said 'me'.
I stood up and I didn't know what to do at that time.
The only thing I thought about was that my friends in the helicopters had been set fire.
I thought it was a 10-15-year-old friend in the regime, and I thought, "We're going to be killed in the end."
The command at the beginning said, 'You're going to cut all the releases except TRT.'
We have a system that monitors the local channels.
Out of 200 local channels, we're going out of the room with 80 words.
My mind is here.
There was no national explosion between them.
If I cut these and say they're all gone, at least they'll get help from outside until then.
Or I said he'd go as far as he went.
We've found out we can't get out of there.
I said, "I'm gonna stop."
I cut out one of the local channel packages.
I cut off the power button from the monitors we can monitor.
So there was no signal on all screens.
I told him I had to go to the antennas so he could cut it off completely.
The commander sent me to the front door with two soldiers.
I opened his room, and a soldier said, "Stand still."
He stopped taking my gun.
He said, "You're gonna cut it off, you're not gonna stay, I'm gonna shoot one of you in the end, that's you."
And now that I'm gone, I said, "You'll see when you're gone," I didn't say anything else.
We went into the station, and I broke the local broadcasts by waking up.
We've gone over the other floor.
At that time, I had developed a system that would be in line with the national channel.
Nearly 20 monitors have been empty since the ground canals.
So my Lord helped us, and We did not oppress them, but He guided them to their ways.
They believed in the answers we gave them.
They didn't.
That comforted us.
When they left the front door, they asked where the trailer was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV publisher," and he asked, "Is there an electrician between you?"
I said, "There's no electricity after dinner, if it's wrong, the team's coming."
Actually, there was an electrician at that time.
I thought I couldn't stop the broadcasts.
I thought I'd cut them off to wake up the soldiers.
They were a little relieved to think that the press had been cut off.
They weren't smart enough to look at the lights.
Now the group is waiting.
About an hour later, when they opened the TV in the waiting room, they saw the release of A News.
He's in the army.
He said, "My commander didn't break the news."
We're looking at the commandant.
He said, "Get up."
I'm tired.
Then a soldier said, "There are still rumors."
He said, "There are channels that spread across the bridge."
I said, "They're spreading over the cave, and we can't do anything to them."
He said, "Then, after he has been inspired with one another, bring us all together."
The crew fled from Turkey with a minibus.
I've seen pictures of the army taking me to the bathroom and giving me water.
They shot three times before and after.
My friends said they were the same soldiers.
With us they used to call that army 'eblat'.
He's probably a hero who makes his army.
They may have been infuriated to get rid of him.
According to Akkaya's statement, the first police force came to Turkey from the Gulf.
When the police found out that they were helicopters around, the security officers were on their way back to the train, they went back to pick up the train.
They're back in 40 minutes.
When the police got here, they didn't see anyone in the Turkish foreign regime.
Only 3-4 minutes after the police told me that the experts were coming to the building from Samanyolu TV, they said to the police, "They called us from inside, we're Turkish personnel, we need to get in immediately."
He said, "They've been wired to their cell phones since the police' identity has been questioned and they've been informed that we've been arrested."

Come on, trust Turkish justice.
If he makes a mistake, he'll be punished.
It's gonna make us tired of running.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's 20-25 days, the police don't deal with anything else.
I said, "We don't need to work, but we don't want Turkey to return to Syria."
We don't want Turkey to be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.

He saw a bomb in Ergenekon, killed FETÖ
The Ankara Public Prosecutor is investigating FETÖ's role in the unprecedented death of the Special Actor Behechat Oktay, who closed the file "Initiated" in 2009.
Mr. Ramasan Akyürek, who was in the same room six days before his death, heard a false name about the terrorist suspect of Hisbullah Terrorist.
In the case of Ergenekon's investigation, some of the important things that have been done are said to have been stolen and buried by the FETU Security Team by Special Harekt Dairessi, which is also being killed because of Oktay's arrest.
In Ankara, which was found to be attacked on 25 February 2009, the period was called "initihar" at the death of President Behchat Oktay.
But there were a lot of questions in the case.
Two years after the legal struggle between the family and the family lawyers and the evidence they put in place, this time the murder investigation was opened.
The left-handed Oktay was in his right-hand hand, saying he shot himself.
He was also diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and a stroke of the body.
The murder investigation case was launched in May 2012.
Only in the murder case, he was convicted of the Halil Emperor who was present at the time of his death.
The final sentence was finalized.
Nurhan Önder, who said that Oktay was involved in the death of another criminal, was sentenced to six months in prison for "not committing suicide and not committing murder."
THE WAY OF HAPPINESS
Meanwhile, while Hüsey's lawyer called the incident "initihar", he appealed to the Supreme Court of Mustafa to investigate the murder.
The Oktay family wants him and his autopsy lawyer to be questioned.
Behchat Oktay's sister, Shule Oktay, and his brother Nezih Oktay, found a lot of lawyers during the trial.
The family who said that Halil Kesici could not kill Oktay alone wanted to expand the investigation.
The family who said the case was under investigation asked the prosecutors to identify and condemn the security officers who wanted to close the file immediately with Hüseyin and Mustafa.
When all the family's demands were rejected, six days before Octay's death, a member of the Abdurrahman Right appeared in the middle of a fake name called Abdurrahman.
It has also been noted that President Ramasan is aware of the scope of the process.
On this development, the Ankara People's Commissioner, who re-take possession of the Behechta Octa file, began to scour the finger of the FETÖ.
The case at the Ankara Criminal Court on the illegality of Oktay will begin on 19 July.
COVER SUBJECT  ANGELS — ARE THEY REAL?
The Oktay family that Sabah met is hoping not to be questioned.
Family members say that the FETÜ fingerprints in the murder were suspended during a previous trial and trial.
Sister Schule Oktay, "This murder has actually come to show."
We didn't get it.
Before my brother was killed, he said, "They'll eat me."
I said, "Kim."
Then he signaled the FETÖ to me.
I thought I was gonna get out of the job.
I never thought of death.
It's behind this thing, of course.
He said, "That's where my management was."
The city called his old family and joined in prayer

After yesterday, the AK Party called for Fahrettin's explanation of 15th-century city, through the Nazim Mavisim, the Nazim Nationalist of Sinop.
The University of Tubbb, a 21-year-old student at the University of Justice, who was shot at in front of the National Institute, explains that, when he prayed for his son and his daughter at night at 1:30 a.m., he said, "When I said we were praying for my son, our High Commissioner also joined in prayer."

In the middle of Thailand, three people lost their lives in the explosions that occurred four times in the field.
The authorities said that three people died in explosions in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, and 35 of them were injured by tourists.
Police Dictionary Pyapan Phingmuang explained that the bombings in his press conference were not related to terror.
Phingmuang, "There's no question about any of Thailand's regional or religious issues."
He used the expression "We think it's an inner sabotage action."
In his statement to the journalists, the Counta leader also said he didn't want to complain about who was behind the explosions.
The father said, "We need to focus on making peace and confidence."
Last year, 20 people were killed and 120 were injured in a bomb attack near the Eravan Camp in Rajprasong, the capital of Bangkok, on August 17th.
"Smoothing Evil" will be wiped out with a magic spell.
Lonnie David Franklin was sentenced to death at least 10 years in the U.S.
Franklin, an old cleaning worker, chose his wives and drug addicts in his murders.
My cousin Kathleen Kennedy, who condemned Franklin, said, "I haven't seen a monster like you and so many crimes in my life."
Franklin says he's one of the bloodiest killers in California's history.
It was learned that 10 people were killed in prison and one person was killed by Franklin, who had been sentenced to death by a prison sentence.
Prevention of FETÖ in Macedonia
Macedonia State President Furkan Chako stated his efforts to bring the extension of the FETÖ countries into line with the law and to initiate the necessary inquiries.
"All of this is known in the community, for its role in the media and in the business world, for example, in Macedonia."
Turks here don't give their kids to FETU schools anymore.
And we call our people to stop sending their children here.
He used to say, "This building, which has benefited from the hospitality of the people and the prosperity of the people, is well-known by the people."
The sky will be exposed to meteor rain.
TÜBITAK, Director-General for Research and University of Istanbul University of Astronomy and Space Sciences Department of Education Dr. Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu, in his speech to the AA professor, said that Perseid will reach the highest level on the night of August 13th on Friday.
The Esenoğlu notes that thousands of parts of the solar system and the impact of the radiation "Swift-Tuttle" have created the atmosphere of Perseid, and that this situation will turn into a natural visual pool.
In fact, Perseide said that the first discovery of the sky was in 1862 and that it began to be seen again in the world since the 1990s.
Perseide, who wanted to see the rain of the sky and the August rain, said, "We have to look at such a spectacular mountain from far away, we have to pay attention."
As a result, this is a natural visual dance.
He said, "He's going to get to know the universe better."
They'll throw red red when they're cold, warm white light
The reason is, given that some of the particles in the sky will fall to the earth in awe during the rain, he continued:
Perseide fats can go up to two thousand centigrams.
Because of the atmosphere's melting and non-smokering, the Persoids produce red in the natural environment, while the heat produces light in white.
The International Space Organization can be found in the field of science, writing how many heavenly bodies have been seen on the Internet.
This data is valuable because it is collected everywhere in the world.
He'll be able to watch all night
The Esenoğlu, who remembered that the sky is moving rapidly about 60 kilometers per second, wanted to be well-sighted all night from less light-sighted areas along the north side of this visual bridge in the sky.
In the year over 100, Esenogul, who discovered that the ocean was at the bottom of the ocean, wrote that after the ocean, the Persians recorded that it was a natural phenomenon to monitor the ocean in the middle of 4-17.
Low-educated, old footballer Erdoğan
At the end of the season, a small number of highly educated footballers, Fettullah, a large-scale religious participant with the populist leader Recep Tayyy and Erdoğan, had won more than a degree from Tashkent from Tashkent, Texas, and also from the University and the educational institution.
It's a translation of an article in an article we've been through in the Foreign Policy.
Erdoğan, a less educated and former footballer at the university, is often placed in the capital of the West, where Gülen, the first message, is described as a wide-ranging entrance.
And then they're trying to explain, "Why does the U.S. and/or the West rise in Turkey?" in the theme articles "Because Erdoğan...".
It is possible to think that the West facing in Turkey is familiar with the history of the analysts who appeared to be in a tense state during the era of Erdoğan.
In fact, when it comes to statistics, the first decade of the Erdoğan period can be read as a period when the East presence in Turkey has decreased or remained in the middle.
For ten years, Zira had had good relations with the European Union and the United States of America.
The fact that Erdoğan has given 'one-minute' to Israel, the acquisition of an EU net policy of nuclear war against Esad's military forces in Syria, the failure of the U.S. military forces to stop Turkey in the military crisis, the fact that some of the ideas of President of the European Parliament such as 'We do not have an Erdoğan', the opening of the war against the United Kingdom, and the opening of the war against Erdoğan in Britain, now the President of London, today the Islamic Republic of China, the bans in Turkey, the regulations in the Syrian Government, the regulations in the Syrian Government, the regulations in the Syrian law of Syria, the regulations in the Syrian law of the US, the regulations in the law of the Russian law of the United States, the regulations in the Russian law of the Russian law of the United States, the law of Russian law in the Russian law of the Russian law, the law of the law of the Russian law of the Russian law of the Russian law of the Russians, the law of Russian law of Russian law and the Russian law of Russian law of the Russians, the law of the Russian law of the Russian States'uns, the Russians of Russians of Russians of Russians of Russians of 15 of San of San of San of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 17 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 17 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 17 of 17 of 17 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 17 of 17 of 17 of 17 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of 15 of sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssslaw
Let's say that when we lose 247 people in blood, we've forgotten that no support for our democracy until the success of the U.S. and the failure of the U.S. war proves to be demonstrated by the United States, and that Kerry's first talk about the construction of 'Turkey' is expected, and that there's no fight against democracy and the elected government.
Well, how will it be forgotten that many leaders from the world, including Turkey, were involved in protesting because of the murder of 11 Charlie Hebdo in Paris, but despite the fact that 247 people who had been killed for democracy had been killed for a month by work in Turkey, no one had come from any other country of the United States?
What do we say to send the presidents or top-level representatives a year for the diplomatic issue?
How do we appreciate the fact that the security newspaper has broken down, that all U.S. and U.S. dignitaries have gone through the visit, and that they are not found on a trip to Turkey's bombed Great National Council?
In the first two weeks of work in Egypt, when the EU sent a top-level representative to work with Sisi, when Kerry's post-work leader said that 'Democratic reconstruction' was being rebuilt, it would be very unusual for Turkey to find the whole country of the United States that, at every opportunity, refused to support democracy in Turkey?
Even now, it is enough to expel the Turkish people from Turkey, whom the people consider to be the cause of war in the US.
And if the plan that I'm looking at above adds to it, I think it's obvious that the rising West/America opposition is a situation that cannot be explained only with Erdogan.
Colonel Erdogan, he didn't even say that he thought the U.S. impact was still in progress...
I mean, we never thought it was an emergency.
Can those who see their own people, who say, "It's a ghost," and who don't think of themselves as "the wise men who come down to the grave," also steal from the same tongue after the night of December 15th?
Did they finally answer the question, "Where are we wrong?" after seeing how this people got into politics and democracy?
But how many questions do you need to answer?
Those who have been given the right to use the weapons of the state in various camps until the end of the world, at one time, were forced to enter the state of Haiti and sought protection from foreign governments.
We need to see how we live in a mental environment and how the backlogs of people lead people to acts that are said to be wrong.
When the brains are in the back of the brain...
Did Turkey have an opportunity to compare its borders to the border of Syria for those taking part in this action?
Why does a boss bomb his own country's parliament?
We should probably not have fallen into a mistake like waiting for smart behaviors with FETÖ's bugs.
Other questions, but we know that everything is not just FETEL.
They have also made the necessary contributions to the political struggle, the wars, and the hatreds.
And they say not of their own selves what is apparent to them, but they believe that every kind of wrong is done away with, and that there is no fault in them.
And when those who hated their people were given the sword, We found them exposed to the Fire.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I'm saying it's a very simple thing: on the 15th of November in Turkey, the FETÖ troops were given 250 cities, camps, soldiers, and many of them were saved from democracy.
But there are three times to be after 15 Tammuz 1992-2002; 2002-2012; and 2012 and later.
There are three changes that have been made in these three times: economic, social, political.
Social change has made two major changes: transfer the metropolis from the northern region and move to the market after it's been around for a very long time.
On Thursday, I said that this move was on the subway.
I'm also impressed that the most important element of social change is not going through the Metro.
It's the second big change bridge and roads in the same direction.
It's easier to understand how the road and the bridge can be modernized.
The road changes economic and social structures.
And so has he changed his political structure.
I've seen this history with the bridge over the border in Istanbul since I was there.
Demirel, he made the Big Bang.
This was the end of the post-50s community movement in the 1960s.
In the past, the same fact has now led to the second bridge that we changed as the 15mous City Centre.
This shows the relationship between even road users and the environment.
It's a sign of how social change has been monitored.
Demirel and Özal's plan was to take out big shots at the center.
I mean, I'm going to give them a central ideology.
The AK Party has not done the third bull for many years.
Because the move was running at all speed.
The people who came were placed in the fields of familiarity.
There was a kind of closed system in those areas.
The AK Party's local government has given people the status, job, social status, and they're the AK Party.
So he didn't want the whales to be in the center, he wanted them to do their political knowledge in the environment and then come to the centre as their own.
This event was related to ongoing successful negotiations (1992-2002) before the AK Party.
These talks accepted the need to stand by the public, not at the center of the audience, but at the center of the audience.
The AK Party has politicalized the political prisoners by acting in the manner I indicated after 2002 and has been involved in politics and has intensified.
After that, look now, it's the same time for the democratic struggle in 15th of December.
So history and sociology are all over it.
I'll add another size: AK Party is not only limited to Istanbul's walls.
It's even more interesting: The AK Party is now complementing the environment with central borders.
It's a two-walled vehicle.
One, Osmangani.
Two, Chanakal, 1915 wall.
Add paths to this.
Turkey, from Trakya to Izmir, will now reach another refugee.
Do you know what that means?
Let's say that the AK Party will now take Izmir from the exit.
Now Bursa, now in Chanakakakal, is going to become the city of Trakya in other parts and social backgrounds.
That's it!
The 15th century is the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie's and hers in Fenerbachhe
Fenerbach, Grashoppers was running the game with the training he had done in the mornings.
The train started at 10 a.m. at the technical director of the Can Bartu Texieri, who started training at 10 a.m., a total of 1 hour 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of Korean training, he made 2 rounds and follow-up to 5-to-do rounds and follow-up.
Coachman, he's done two games in the dark field.
Fenerbach, he's gonna take his preparations with the training he's going to do tonight.
The guy who complained about the Aziz Year's Eve...
New developments are being made with regard to the Schike Operation in Fenerbach.
A program published in CNN Turkey and explained that this operation was carried out by FETÜ, Hüseyin Gülerce, "from a sports world named Fatullah Gülen has developed words about himself."
He said, "One year on the plane, this guy said, "What do you have with your Fethullah Gülen?"
And when this person was transferred to the Sun, Fethullah Günn went to the Aziz Year.
Why did he go to the Aziz anniversary?
The head of the club, which is the most diverse of Turkey's, might hurt himself if it's this idea.
He used the expression "the case was to celebrate the Aziz Year."
After that, an explanation came from Faik Light, one of the most important lawyers in the Czech Republic.
He went out to the Anti-Visit Program published in Light News and explained the person who complained about FETÜ's president Fatullah Gülen.
Here's what File Light says:
The Aziz Year is saying something about Fethullah Gülen, and Ihsan Kalkavan.
When he comes from Azerbaijan, he's on a special plane.
Aziz is a noble man, and he's talking to the tough words when he's making someone up.
Those burning roots may be a bit of a mess.
He can show some attitude to those roots.
These compounds are growing somewhere.
It's not like I'm going to go to them as well as I'm going to Umre. It's not gonna be so nice to be accepted.
What they say makes it hard.
The only problem is, of course, it's not.
In the meantime, they're testing a football team.
Some footballers and managers from the Galatasara Club have direct connections and thank Hakan...
Muharramem Usa: The Czech case is different
Trabzonsport President Muharrem Usta extended his friendship to Fenerbahch.
The issue of Turkey is the issue of all clubs, "We're on the side of this country with 79 million."
We've got to get a haircut.
If there's a problem with FETUS, if it's wrong, I'm standing behind Fenerbach.
"But there's a difference between Trabzonsport and Phenerbache."
Sacrifice sacrifices were offered
Carobult said, "We've identified the price of a living sacrifice as a kilogram of 18 litres."
He said, "We've also identified the price of two kilograms of human life, 17 litres, and 15 litres of the animal's live kilograms, which we've established as second grade."
And Carobulut, who noticed that animals that were not to be sacrificed last year, said that they should take care of the victims:
In particular, animals need to pay attention to their earphones.
Also important is that the animal is healthy.
That's why they can control our relatives' passports when they get their victims.
The victim must have been alive and alive and thrown his balls on it.
And you don't have to be marked as salt on your face.
In recent years, we have seen non-sacrifice animals sacrificed and sold.
An animal with a sacrifice must be two years old.
We can understand this by looking at the animal's teeth.
A 2-year-old animal's mouth is out of the mouth that we've designed as a "head."
But these little animals, who are younger, haven't had their teeth.
The animal may look great, but it may not have been able to reach its mouth.
It's just that your mouth's already large because it's already bigger than others.
The Rize Airport will be set up in the sea
The second airport to be built by the seabed in Turkey will be the Rize Airport.
The Rize Havaliman will be built on the seabed of 26 to 32 metres from the river.

The project of the Rize Naval will be completed in nine months.
Motor Difficulties - switch devices
I've divided companies into eight rounds to spend half of this night on the lithium of the engine.
According to the information received by the Petrol Landers from the Trade Union (PUIS), the average price will be increased by 8 rounds of engine litres since 13 August 2016.
Therefore, the average engine price of the litre in Ankara is 3.68 litres will rise to 3.76 litres.
The cost of the engine in Istanbul will be 3.63 litres of 3.71 litres, and 3.66 litres of 3.74 litres of izmir.
The prices, discounts and freedoms identified by the distribution companies can show small changes in terms of companies and fields.
I broke up with the companies, four rounds a week ago for the engine's lithium price.
This is the Galatsaarena footballers in Gülen's conversation.
On one occasion, Galatasaray and millions of footballers, who shot the Turkish football team, came into the midst of the FETÖ leader Fatullah Gülen's debate in 1996.
In a 1996 vision, Fettullah Tütneker and Joseph Teppeule are among the footballers who listen to Gülen's speech.
He used the term "4-dollar hits" to refer to Galatasaray.

Robert Amsterdam's most frequent statements about FETÖ!
Robert Amsterdam&Partners, the competent legal firm for the international legal activities of the FETÖ, has shared information on how FETÖ is organized by an article in Forbes, the U.S.
Fettullah, president of FETEL, pointed out that he managed Gülen's assets from Pennsylvania's capital, Amsterdam, said that Gülen's "how nearly 150 talks (charter) schools in the U.S."
Amsterdam stated seven months ago that it was the duty of Turkey to investigate the Sun-related companies and schools, and that they had been found so far as to be "slow-fashioned".
Amsterdam, in the article, took place at the following meetings:
According to the information given to us by the prosecutors, the day-to-day intelligence is a mystery.
These exercises usually take place at hundreds of gatherings in Poconos in Günn and Poconos.
There's a seven-person management group on the floor.
This group is transferring the instructions to the speech committee.
From here on, studies go to the parishes, to the parishes of the country, to the parishes of the country, to the parishes of the country, to the parishes of the country, to the parishes of the city, to the parishes of the student houses (to the lighthouses) and to the students.
He's working at different levels according to his positions and his support, bureaucrats and bosses.
Amsterdam, who reported that 55,000 jobs were open in the world in general and had the largest commercial school in the United States, reported that each year, millions of dollars were paid to these schools by U.S. officials.
Amsterdam wrote that a large part of these money was directed among themselves and transferred to "elected" charity companies.
Amsterdam explained this with the following examples:
The Magnolia schools established in California, which are connected to the Sun, and which share the same office, have been arrested for the annual service contract of $700,000.
Amsterdam showed the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam reported that the school had paid more than $3.1 million to its owner, and that the authorities of the state-owned company had been found to be of the same persons as Gülen.
Amsterdam, which has the largest location in the solar system, has also noted that there are similar situations in 46 high school Harmony schools, has paid money to smaller companies associated with FETÖ, such as the conflict.
Amsterdam, drawing the bottom of what was done in the FETU, says, "These examples I've given show that the US tax benefits are spent on the wrong of about 28 million dollars."
"It's part of what we've found so far," he used the expression.
Amsterdam, who has pointed out nothing has been done to prevent such events so far, reminded me that the situation in my language has been worse, and that all of this has begun to investigate the irregularities of the Texas Education Department.
Amsterdam pointed out that schools seem to work normal and that there are no information on what kind of obstacles many employees have to face.
Amsterdam, "But these schools actually work like a car machine for the Sun."
"The money that has been spent later is used for political contributions to hide illegal activities," he said.
According to a former U.S. teacher who worked in these schools, Amsterdam said that some workers in the Sun held meetings separately and transferred a certain part of their funds to the fund, "It is believed that the Sun members of the Turkish Armed Forces are working in the same operation."
In the years since, it has strengthened the positions of the miners.
"But it seems that the army was gathering power behind a parallel power station while working normally."
Amsterdam, the article ended with the following:
The U.S. policy makers have 15-16 Times and later issues, and that's what's expected.
However, taking into account the two welfare situations at a diplomatic level, it is generally necessary to wake up those in state institutions who are involved in the operations of Gülen in a series of U.S. law enforcement operations.

Hüseyin O. (13) was seriously injured by Mustafa O., the result of the confrontation on the bicycle.
The car driver took the wounded children to the emergency health station in Narince, in order to prevent them from entering the van.
Two wounded children were taken from here to the State Hospital with the ambulances.
From the victims, the Hüsein O. gives me a life fight in my mind.
She moved the children to the bathroom so that they wouldn't be dragged in.
Mustafa O., explaining the case, "We're going to visit with friends."
We got our stuff.
The village of Karadut was hit by a traffic accident near the prophet’s visit by the prophet Ozeyir.
My leg was broken with the impact of the shock.
So she took my friend first and threw the bag.
Then she took me and put me in the back of the car with my friend.
When I put the bagaja, my hand stayed between my back door.
I cried, too.
He's throwing back the door of the bar that heard the sound.
I fixed my hand, too.
The Bagaj door closed again and took us to Narince village.
He said, "Then the ambulances took us to the State Hospital."
The family of the wounded children became the complainant when they learned that their driver had brought the children into the barracks.
The wounded child's name is Mustafa O. "I was in Kahta when it was a disaster."
I found out by phone that my grandson and I were having an accident with my tortoise.
I'm here to the Second Devlet Hospital.
They brought my dinner first.
15 minutes later, they brought me my tortoise.
Gerger Karakol's here.
The priest said, "Are you a complainter?"
I'll be in trouble everywhere.
I said I'm not a spy.
Then I went and looked at the car that hit my neck and chest.
There's a lot of blood in the bag.
Then we learned that after the attacks on the children, he put both wounds in the back of the car and brought them to such a hospital.
He's wearing a baggy suit on top of my neck.
People say I don't put the bag on.
But we're gonna fix the back of the car.
He said, "It's okay."
"The village of Narince is the town of Mehmet Kaya, and "The street that hits the children, has brought the wounded here."
The kids, the wounded, got out of the car's garage.
He said, "He did what he should not be done."
His cousin, Osman O. And he said, "What kind of man is he who shot these kids?"
It could be an accident, and a person could die in a disaster.
But it's a strange thing to catch the wounds and take them to the hospital in the garage.
We're followers until the end of this work.
One of these kids is dying.
The other one's sick.
From Narince to Kahta brings injuries in the back of the car.
God bless you.
There's no such thing as a war anymore.
It's burning our brains.
We're gonna be a lawyer, and we're not gonna let this thing go.

Fire safety manager captured in Zaho
Class 3 Security Manager Ahmet Duran Bitmez, responsible for the Batman Il Security Administration, was opened to investigate FETÖ's entry into employment.
It was also stated that the decision to arrest was made by Bitmez, who was released.

Take care of your children’s behavior
Dr. Bilgin Girey, the Dentist School of Dentistry, said that they were satisfied with this reflection by making it easier for children to do the work of breastfeeding in their early years.
Dr. Girray, who is responsible for seeing fingerprints in children, says, "It's an event that has been seen since I was three to four years old."
Most babies don't want to get over it.
When the baby is born, the child will give his finger to heal for his mother's sake and give her finger to heal after she's 1-1,5 years old.
He said, "The finger can be found in his mother's conduct when he's asleep when he's asleep, when he's awake and he's out of his mother's house."
Dr. Awarein Girray, who pointed out that because of the child’s disability and child’s lack of confidence in parental custody, the fingerprints seen in the years ahead, have had an impact on the oral health of this behavior, said:
The fingerprint's behavior shows an effect in the shape of a child's tooth structure.
In the womb, the lips of those who come out of the womb are cut off at the end of the womb, and the bones under the womb are broken.
This will also allow the bottom line to be placed on the back, and it will damage the edge of the tooth and tooth structure.
It's a physiological side effect, but it's in the form of speech disorder and aesthetically distasteful appearance.
Dr. Girray, who noticed that a much more complex treatment process could occur during a period of six to seven years when there was no previous solution, "We can prevent the loss of our children from completing their development and further problems."
"That's why children need to be kept under control, like hearing and hearing controls in our day," he concluded.
New light in the near sight treatment: Trifokal Lensler
Postpartum therapy doesn't want to be used naturally by patients.
For many years, it has been used to solve this problem in our patients.
A further step in the success of the treatment in this area has been taken by trifocal mercenaries that have begun to be used in recent times.
It is not only the distance or close to the rest of the trifocal lenses but also the feature of a clean meeting in the areas identified as the interstellar.
Remote, near or between sightseeing errors
The distance between the sights is a point that we use very often in our everyday life.
For example, the car display panel, the computers we're holding in our pocket, or the range we're identifying as 60-70 cm arm length.
They don't need to use glasses in any way near or far as Trifocal Lens can fix their differences.
Another advantage that trifocal markets provide is to reduce complaints at night.
Dr. Volkan Hürmeric "The tripocal Lens Treatment applied for the treatment of each community is different from the normal catacomb treatment."
The Trifocal therapy that we use, our patients, are able to maintain their health by a seven-and-a-half-minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can return to normal lives.
In particular, it is an operation that raises the quality of life for people who use a car, who love to read more, and who enjoy a more active life.
You can also apply this procedure to every patient who is 18 years of age to see if it is appropriate for you.
It's not used in the varicella heart surgery!
Varis, in the last few years, it's a much more frequent disease.
It's a legacy where genetic proximity is precipitated; long-term working hours, long-term work, and long-term rest are the cause of increasing the burden of the legacy.
Is the needles used for heart surgery?
I have a difference, what do I do when I'm going through a heart attack?
That's the answers to these questions.
There are two types of cluster systems in the back:
1. There's a system of deep-rooted groups that carry blood into the liver and collect basic blood from the bone.
These are called deep femoral veins and surface femoral veins.
The problems in these groups are worse, they don't shut down their disease, and drug treatments are used to keep these cells open.
There's a system of solar panels that's carrying blood in the back and that's going along with the deep cluster system.
This system is made up of two large and two small-scale clusters that we say are inside.
There's a lack of resources and a legacy that can be acquired in four of these camps.
Heart surgery can be used in groups, large-sighted or semi-saturated groups.
There is no harm in the body that these cells do not have, so they can be used in their heart operations.
However, in order for these bees to be used in heart surgery, they must be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
It reduces the work load and makes the leg more healthy.
A wrong belief among the people, even if it is a legacy, will be used as a bribe.
Variance is never used in your heart operations!
There are other needles that can be used for heart surgery.
Systems of needles that can be used for heart surgery; under the head of the skin, around the needle and in the neck.
It's not safe to wait and worry about it to use the inheritance ring for heart.

Here's what Dursun Özbek took into account at the Turkish football club:
On Friday evening, August 13th, Konya's Grand City will meet Super Cup for the Super Cup in Torku Arena.
This game's neither the first nor the last of our club's recaptures.
But as time goes by, it's a life-threatening encounter.
As all of us know, our country was hit by a big storm on the night of December 15th.
The FETÖ/PDY's entry into service, the unity and unity of the entire population, was the result of the FETÖ/PDY, the FETÖ/PDY.
And that night We ransomed them with a great sacrifice,
We gave the cities.
We've got plenty of gas.
This painful body once again reminded us of the fate of democracy, the need for war in these villages, not the need for silence, and the importance.
On that night, representatives of the Turkish sport rose up against the work as a single voice, and they always took a seat with their democracy.
In these critical days, we need more than ever the competitor of the race.
I would like to see President Solomon Seba to be the first to play in the Turkish sport of love and competition in the new football season, which is immediately before the 2nd anniversary of the death of President Solomon Seba, and our club's headmaster, Turga Sheren, who is the first to take the name of the new football season.
Whatever the score at the end of the game, I hope the winner will be our country and Turkish track.

Well, the problem between the London and London was that Jamie Stuff, the beginner, had to change.
They did this right when Hindus came out.
Hoy's wife, Kian Emadi, and Matt Crampton's trying to fill up.
Scott had already seen his potential and the British coach didn't leave Skinner.
Four years ago, Hoy, a champion with India, Kenny and Skinner, broke the Olympic record, but New Zealand's first show re-designed the record.
And the British triad came out for gold.
Hindi, even though he was a little late in his own class, he took care of Kenny's team, and Skinner stopped it.
This strategy was a major change in the evolution of Kenny and Skinner, using a much larger tool to slow him down.
Hey, BBC was watching them from the spot as an expert director, and when they went out on the podium, they looked at Skinner, Kenny and Hindus.
Gladowlu, 23-year-old Skinner said, "This is an honorable comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and hear my name.
At the end, we broke the Olympic record and won the world champions.
That wasn't really incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
In 2012, London admitted that after she won a battle with Kenny and Hoy, she admitted that after the bad start, she fell in a piece of shit.
And then he took this step, and there was no way of asking for Britain's files.
This time, there was no such problem with an incredible metaphor.
The Hindus said, "We were like London with all the Great Britain's beaches in Stanton."
We're just a team set up three months ago.
We have lost so much of the world's war, so it's really incredible to have won again in the Olympics.
It's just an activity for a country that won 10 battles in London.
If this is the size of the progress we've shown in the last five months, he's waiting for us five more days to make it.
It turns out that it's not very impossible for Kenny to make a record of three gold medals in the only Olympics.
This is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and he was born on March 23rd (at the same time the birth of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a sacred history of British sports) which means that Kenny had access to six gold medals and a silver medal.
This means the same level as Hoy.
Kenny, after that, she'll go out to the sprint competition; the competition will start today, and it'll take three days.
Boltonlu, 28, said, "Now I'm just enjoying it.
Team activities are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
If it is to be honest, the only way to win is to feel alone.
And the Hindus said, "If two gold medals are worth more, they'll have to be awarded a prize to themselves."
It's just this day's work, but there's a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owen Dowell were the first to complete a four-mile round.
Pisti 3:51.943 was completed.
London's world record for the gold medal winner in 2012 3:51.659.
First turn and final (22:42) today will be identified in the second section, and Wiggins will certainly focus on all his attention.
There was a disagreement with the officials when they called on them to measure the size of the day's schedule.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Milgavia have reached the world record for the women's activities to continue and complete tomorrow.
The Great Britain Team trusts a strong bicycle team to take over and win many medals during the middle of the Olympic Games.
Well, after great excellence was shown in London, expectations in Rio were greatly reduced.
In the background, technical director Shane Sutton also experienced a number of bad developments that included significant names, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, due to sexual and violent crimes.
But the first night after the contest, it shows that the limit to Britain's perfect time of completion will be re-examined this time.
The question of the future of Portland's scale with the imperial power agreement
The future of the Portuguese aluminium class in Victoria, and the work of hundreds of workers, became uncertain after the fact that one of the main holders of a contract was explaining the fact that one of the main providers of energy companies would be able to open up all their talks in the Italian way.
This move was followed by the decision of the Victorian government to continue its work this year in the face of the suspension.
The 20-year stable subjugation is complete in November.
Alcoa may be at risk in Portland until 2000.
Any closure may be due to the fact that the work is directly or indirectly under threat by 2,000.
And it could also be the impact of gravity on Victoria's entire electricity by about 10 percent.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed school, and this opened the way for England's energy control to be shut down last year.
Alcoa's portfolio is losing money and is facing the risk of closure.
These developments have taken place after a few years of speculation that will soon take place on the basis of the resurgence of the dividends in Australia and shortly before.
The great alumni student, Loy Yang A, who was in Latrobe Vadisi, expressed his hope that the AGL, which provides energy from the power plant, would move through the negotiations with the other three owners.
The vast majority of the strains are the participation of Alcoa and Alumina and the CITIC of China and Marubine Corp companies in Japan.
"AGL expects Portugal to continue its work; this also means that the physical electricity demand of the student continues."
AGL stated that the talks should be carried out since November 2016 as "risk assessment agreements".
The negotiations will be concluded in 2017 as a 12-month period of pessimism.
The Energy Company said, "That is why AGL will continue to wait for the talks to be held for the financial year 2017."
The effects of the 2018 AGL on the financial year and subsequent potential gains are limited by the existence of a strong legal agreement for the total electricity prices.
AGL indicated that the value of the transactions in its accounts was now $187 million.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the negotiations "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to operate or provide electricity to the student."
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was expected to enter into the contract this year in November, but did not explain why it had not yet been concluded.
Analysts, also in Victoria, have been calling for the closure of the economic difficulties in the area of Tomago, near the portland coastal area and in Newcastle.
This week, AGL's operational accountability to analysts, Stephen Mikkels, Portland, said that about 600 megawatts each year, and tomago 900 megawatts were used.
In case both of these bases are removed from the market, the demand in the [electric] market will be reduced to a value.
And as a producer, it will not be a good development for us."
Cardashian TV program is not just the year; Kendall, Vogue's Sundays are closed
The fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Genner group of Kendall Jenner (20), the mother of the model and manager, is at the end of the four-year-olds waiting for ADD Vogue.
Kendall, who was an Estee Lauder brand member and who was a member of the Milan, Paris, and New York fashion group for weeks, heard this news from the Instagram account on Friday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried in a room full of people I loved."
After the opening of the gate, the stranger who was taken from the entire Cardassian-Generic family (who was in trouble with Rob and Caitlyn and everyone who loved the most) from the world's boss, Ryan Seacrest (or only from the Keeping Up program with the Cardassians), was released a series of scenarios of reality; a classic one was later prepared by the family who forgot their sister's closure: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Even though this is a classic story line for every "birth day" section of all the children's television programs, Kriss, the other girls were supposed to include this recognition in a way.
We must have entered a new Cardassian cycle with this development in Vogue's Christmas number.
Kendall's brother Kim may have passed it on to Vogue's bed (she shared it with Kanye West in November 2014) but it's a success at the top of the Christmas bed.
Vogue's number of Christmass, the biggest sales of the year.
In one fashion report, he drew attention to this number of advertising ads, which included the contents of the advertising book in the 832 pages of the past year.
It's also a period that's been closely monitored by the explanation of the star; it's been in front of the image of the giants for the past two years.
Previously on the roof, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss have been found.
In recent years, many of the "smooth models" in the cap are given to "modalists."
Oscar, an Oscar hired Dior, took a seat in 2013 in the Capape of Jennifer Lawrence, and the following year, this honor was given to Lady Gaga.
But in the case of Ms. Jenner's previous category, the genetic model, which is known as "smart model", it can be said that the environment is very good.
These celebrations are not today’s youths, because they are the neighbors of famous people or because they are actually starring stars or good Snapchat videos (all of this is the war Jenner).
All of this is women who are skilled, who are prominent in the entertainment sector.
Beyonce, who took place last year, spent one of the best times of his career with Lemonade's exit.
Of course not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of the reality of the show, Jenner's fashion world will always be disturbing.
In the spring, Victoria's Secret model was named after Stephanie Seymour, Jenner, and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the shadows of the weather."
When the news of Jenner's getting into Vogue's lock, that thought came back to the surface of the water.
But it doesn't seem right to focus on unhappiness.
Kendall Jenner, at the end of Vogue's Christmas.
A perfect model with the full meaning of his word.
He's getting himself into Marc Jacobs' mistakes.
He's taking you from the Estee Lauder Fund.
He's selling his own pictures with his sister's sister's payrolls on you.
Cindy Crawford, who takes pictures, sells pictures of her daughter's daughter to the LOVE newspaper.
And in empty times, maybe it's just his brother Kurtney and his kids who take a real place on TV.
Global legal support centres turn 160,000 people back every year
While the sector is preparing to create more financial certainty in the ongoing forced operations, over 160,000 of the most vulnerable individuals in the country are turning from the community-based support centres.
In Queensland, three of the five persons (mostly the elderly, immigrants, defenseless workers, violent combatants, and the like) are returned to free legal advice and representation.
The collective legal support services that have broken down their situation are being prepared for more determination.
This legal support centre, which has been scheduled for the month of the previous year, is planning to leave more than 30 percent of the federal funding.
President James Farrel, Director of the Queensland Centres of Public Legal Affairs, said that thousands of people were found to have been returned to the United Nations final number report every year.
Mr Farrell said that the federal government's decision would make a lot worse.
He said, "Queensland's collective legal support centres receive chronicly insufficient financial support, and this means that thousands of people do not have access to services that are essential to life,"
People who fight against powerful and powerful forces in the media, family members, and workers who are forced to work in an unfair manner... are facing all of these issues of legal sizes and are unable to get help from what they feel they need in this report.
The federal government, which will cut the funding from Haziran in 2017 by 30 seconds, also means that thousands of Queensland's law will have to be abandoned without aid from more complex legal issues.
We call upon the General Court and Queensland Senator George Brandis to get back these financial credentials so that they can receive the support they need when people are faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the government, the legal support funder, took place in place of the commitment to national mediation.
Now we need to look at what the Palaszuk government will do with the community's support centres and the communities they serve.
Donald Trump's campaign team was accused after the person was shot.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team, North Carolina's director of operations, was accused of saying that he had been shot by a person after he was told that he had been shot by a gun in the summer.
Waka, a former software teacher at the state campaign team on Thursday, was brought to trial by Vincent Bordoni at the state court.
Brodoni said he expected to be concerned about the situation for months, but then he realized that "it's not going to be."
According to Bordini's complaint, Director Earl Philip "takes out a gun, puts his right finger on it, and puts his finger on Vincent's finger."
According to the report, once the local and regional campaign team found out that at least four people were living in the same experience with Phillip.
"You don't have to be shot to destroy weapons," said Bordini in his complaint.
The case was opened two days later, telling the majority of the President-in-Office of the Republic of North Carolina that Hiller Clinton's election and the election of his own judges would take place after two days.
Trump's campaign team said that the media appreciated these words outside the connection and that they did not support their violence.
Brodini, with complaints, I'd like to examine the campaign team and the attack, the damage and damage caused by Phillip.
Trump's dictionary Hope Hicks didn't turn the message he wanted to make an appeal fast.
The efforts to reach Phillip have been in vain.
A local news reporter at Charlotte's WCCB said Phillip was out of the campaign a short time ago.
The call to Innovative Consulting Services was not made to turn back immediately.
The president of the community is running a campaign that created Donald Trump's suspicion.

The auditing database is again available in the Commission
The world's largest fund is expected to enter into the world's largest bank account, and it has been issued without a voice on Turkey's property reserves.
It was decided that the fund should not be re-examined by the audit mechanism but was re-confirmed by the Commission before any changes were made.
AKP, who brought Turkey's Property Fund to the law, said, "We are certainly against the fact that this will result in the unemployment fund, which will be set aside for the unemployed, without parental controls."
The Government's proposal to provide a long-term source for investments and projects was removed from the law on the day before the meeting of the mayor, which was intended to provide a long-term source of resources.
But today's AKP's offer has brought the plan and the Portuguese Commission back.
The CHP member of the TBMM Plan and the Belgian Commission told the former State Council member Utku Čakrázózer, who was a member of the Czech Republic, about the concerns and concerns of the CHP regarding the provision of the State Fund law.
They say, "When the foundation of this fund came to the Portuguese Commission in the form of a tower law, our former capital, Zechariah Temisel, asked for our concerns and concerns, it was offered to be seen separately from the law of the tower."
The government that has accepted this meeting has also redesigned the design.
The design came back to the commission today.
He said, "The government seems to be making it difficult to get rid of Meclis within a week."
He will say, "We are the biggest worry problem in the proposal of this law."
"The property belonging to the people, the worker, the staff will be required to receive from the workers, the income will come from the unemployment fund that will be collected for the unemployed, the income that will be saved from being self-employed, and that will be returned to an unregulated structure outside the Meclis and Mailsa trial and there will be no liability."
Russia, China and the Körfez, which are founded by these types of funds, will say, "But we have a plan."
So the money will be from its resources, that is, from the people's money.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund is planned to be transferred from the global unemployment fund, which is still needed for workers, 100 billion, and 50 billion in the absence of specialization.
He said, "This fund will be entirely made up of the people's money, even if it has to be in the community's investigation, and this money must not be spent in any way."
The Prosecutor, who argued that the government's resources were collected and the government's assets were being charged, said that it was not acceptable for a fund to be held outside the Meclis investigation, and that the Property Fund's law was concerned and concerned about the offer:
The collection, expenditure and processes of such a large population are not carried out only by independent management companies.
The people's investigation must also be made and the chief must be done.
There are no jurisdictions on the application of the Law, the Property Fund's audits and leadership.
No restrictions have been imposed on the amount of resources to be transferred.
No one's gonna ask about how this fund is used.
The fund aims to show the need to finance large projects.
There's no need to build an uncontrollable fund for this.
Why don't you take it in your pocket?
And then, naturally, the question is, "Why does the competition and the Meclis control go away?"
He went on to say that he was not opposed to the transfer of money to investments in the real estate fund, but that he was opposed to the non-chiefed, unaccountable mechanisms, he said, "Is there a need for a fund like this to be discussed?"
But if the Government insists on doing so, we need to ensure that the international standards that such investment funds are set up in other countries are also valid in Turkey.
It must be configured in a way that the control and accountability mechanisms are brought.
It must be constructed in such a way that it will give the account of its own money used for the final round.
In the case of the property fund, the Commission's proposal for a law, it will clear the bottom of their opposition to the Commission, "We are pleased that the AKP is listening especially after the 15th century's entry into work in Meclis."
We also hope that the AKP will listen to our manufacturer's instructions on the application of this law.
We are opposed to the illegal use of thousands of objects, the diversion of them, the absence of responsibility for those who use them, and the lack of cultural control.
He said, "God's Property Fund can only be useful if these concerns are gone."
It was learned that efforts were being made to provide distance between AKP and the conference.
"The investments we've heard in Turkey are a demonstration of security."
Ford Automotive Management Board President Ali Koç, speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, said, "I'm investing 30 billion TLs that we've been doing in five years, a sign of confidence that we've heard about our country's coming."

It is not just to attract more foreign investment in Turkey; it is a reliable and just legal system, a democracy in international standards, qualitative labour and Ar-Ge, innovation, interoperability and housing.
In the last few years, our government has given our journalists the most comprehensive incentives in our history of the Community.
"I believe that he used a new expression "We can start the "We'll be able to start the launch of the "We'll start" with these incentives and all the strategies we need.
Siemens Sanai and Ticaret Turkey's CEO and CEO Hüseyin Gelis, "We no longer know this as a single country, we know it as global players."

We could've brought these villages to Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be found in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we're going to build factories, but we have to be clear in this area."
Indicates Turkey's first 10 countries for itself, Shell Turkey's President Ahmet Erdem says, "Turkey, Turkey's first 10 countries for Shell."
We sincerely believe Turkey's potential and future.
We've invested in a number of fields to start energy and we're going to continue to do it.
We thank our President, our President and our Banks for their international investors' support for their work.
The international investment is being done in trust.
He said, "This is in the way of increasing the receptive power of our country."
Sandoz/Novartis, President of the Central East and Central Turkey, Dr. Altan Demirdere, "We will be visiting Turkey on 10 August."
But it's been a long time ago.
We've been through this, too.
Because CEO's coming was very important.
They've found a car that doesn't pass, like security.
And then when he came here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left his shields and his car and returned to his country happily.
I'm investing in a country like marriage.
First of all, if everything goes wrong, you'll get married and you'll get married with a long-term plan.
And we're married to Turkey, and we're not meant to divorce.
He's back from my flight!

The President-in-Office, who stated that Turkey's sector is a sector of numbers that will ensure its proper success, said, "We must not delay the period of transition to 'Sanaji 4.0' in the sector."
He said, "If we are highly valued and we are interested in reaching our country's goals in 2023, we need to think about it with our knowledge and technology revolution."
15 December night, when the President-in-Office added that Turkey had returned from a great disaster, he said, "Those who claimed to be our country, those who tried to destroy democracy, those who were not ashamed of the bombing of our Gaza Strip, if they were successful, we were talking to another Turkey today."
We're going to talk about Turkey between the three world countries that have been ruled by Darbe, have been removed from the middle of the world, and have fallen from the League of Developing Countries.
"Thanks to God, our people, our leader, our leader, our leader, our leader, and the government of Erdoğan, we committed this evil with the determination of our government."
The President-in-Office said, "We'll go out of this situation and look forward to it."
It's never true that we're living with honest work.
We have very specific goals ahead of us.
This entry into employment did not interfere with Turkey's economy.
The chaos and crisis waiters were wrong once more.
Today's democracy is on the rise, and our economy is on the move.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to work in a healthy way.
In 2015 the external trade appeared to fall by 25 percent.
Cari opened her door in 2014 at 5.8 in the year, and it went back to 4.5 in 2015.
We're going to fall to 4:00 this year.
We'll never change our situation on the people's estate.
Turkey's 2016 budget has been more than 130 billion dollars.
We've been down to 1.3 percent in 2015 and we're trying to protect these things.
We're better than the EU, and we're better than many countries in the world.
Our banking financial sector prevents them from working on a healthy land.
"We didn't need to pay the price, despite our Bank 15 Timmuz, and we don't have any word of explanation in our reserves, but we have a gross reserve of $121 billion on our reserves."
The President-in-Office of the Council, who announced that the development of the economy, the increase in production and the creation of new areas of desire, will make it easier for all kinds of people to make their lives easier, "We are also making comprehensive arrangements to save you from your responsibilities in the past."
We've made many adjustments to the amount of cash you've got from Stok's mouth, and we've continued to spend as much as possible as possible on tax charges that have not been reimbursed and reimbursed.
He said, “Go on producing for the people, and trust in your land, and your government will continue to remove from you the obstacles.”
Hakan's father was taken from high sugar to the hospital
The FETÖ/PDY earthquake in Sakarya, the father of Hakan Thank you for the operation of the FETÖ/PDY earthquake in Sakarya, was transferred to the final hospital during the interrogation.
The Sakarya Community Commissioner, after 15 Tammuz's entry into work, was sent to the FETÖ/PDY terror camp to capture an old million football team, Hakan Thank you and his father Sermet Thank you for the night.
The father of Hakan Thank you, who was taken to the Arapazar at the end of Friday's prayer today, was taken to the hospital while Sermet thanked him for his question.
The treatment of Sermet Thank you for raising sugar continues at the Sakarya Education and Research Hospital.
Turkey is not from the West, it is not from the European Union.
Mehmet Shmishek: Turkey does not depart from the West, does not abandon the European Union
The Assistant Minister Mehmet Shimšek, the Department of Science and Technology of Faruk, the Department of Economic Affairs, the Department of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the United States.
At the meeting, I think the Science and Technology Foundation is a unique one, "I think there are many good results from the developments that have taken place in the night of December 15 and later."
The most important of these is undoubtedly the unity and spirit that all Turkey feels at this time.
The 15th century has shown Turkey's economy as well as its population as well as democracy.
"It is clear that the next period will be easier and faster to progress for a population that has taken hold of this level in the economy, democracy and democracy."
"I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry."
Faruk Zeybekci, who said that they were forced to report their entry to the world by 15 Timmuz, said that they had been involved in this matter as a government.
In view of the slow downs set by banks in the last few years, "if my first five-faced real sector's wife is going to phase up, we need to concentrate on all our work on this."
Our Chief is coming back to tell him about this.
With the Reel sector, the banking system, the government, the politics, the 15-Temmus civil democracy revolution, the unity that politics has shown and, together with Turkey, has to be rescued from this distress.
In this regard, we welcome the developments in the last days.
"In our current period, we're going to realize that this recovery, which starts at nine and a half points at nine points in the month that the banks started with the development of our President, can also be sustained by supporting this recovery as a result of the eight-way economic management."
"WOMAN PASSAPPORT, SHOULD YOU SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD BE THE EMERGENCY OF OUR HEART."
"We will be the winner of the world in our time," said Nihat Zeybek, "we will not leave a country that has not been taken into the world under the leadership of our Lord, nor will we leave a door stolen."
We're not gonna let anyone else contact us about adding our ticket.
He said, “We will never follow it, nor will we follow it; nor will we follow the birds after it.”
Zeybekchi also used the expression "one of the most recent decisions that has come out of his law, and we have decided to manage it in the economic field now, and we will give our first numbers to the first 1 in 17 and 20 000 refugees, which represent this country."
"DARKS OF THE DRINKS OF THE GERMANY OF THE GERMANY OF THE GERMANY
Prime Minister Mehmet Shimishek, who later spoke about the entry of 15 Timmuz to work and later to OHAL, said, "We need to look forward to entering work."
Shimishek, who said that for two simple reasons, OHAL was linked, said, "Of course, those in this rise need to be cleansed from the state of the labour market, and this process is running; but more importantly, there was serious reforms to prevent this type of labour from continuing."
This is also a climate that is necessary for these ruling reforms, the Olaganist Party has been launched, and so far there have been very serious structural reforms.
"When we do all of this, of course, we have moved democratic leaders and the rule of law, we will continue to do so."
Shmishek, who said that life has become normal in many areas, pointed out that there is no least reason why companies and companies are concerned about the financing of terrorism.
Switzerland, who wanted Turkey's democracy to improve, said: "Bence Turkey's democracy has improved, because when you look at the roots of the recent problems, you will see that this illusion network is working.
"The removal of this threat from the state by means of his country will strengthen Turkey's democracy."
Shishk, who says that the foundations of the economy are generally healthy and that they have returned to normal structural reform days without ever losing, "there is progress in structural reforms in Turkey."
We're not going to have structural reforms anymore, because in the world, populism and security are increasing.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future of reform," he said.
Finally, Shmishek, who claimed that Turkey would not be part of the West, said, "Turkey may be different from our time-bound volunteers, our friends; but Turkey does not go from the West, does not leave the European Union."
From 25 meters to the sea, it was fishing, and...
In Antalya, 17-year-old Samuel Tayyar Bizarcaire, a 25-metre-high-level sea-fisher named 'Cartal Tepesi', became ill when he was caught by seamen.
In the Conjaalt district, Samil Tayyar Bajracht, who spent evenings with his friends, then sailed to the sea from the sea at 25 metres high known as "Cartal Tepesi" below the current.
Professor Samuel Tayyar Bajrakker, who was a professional poet, was affected by the impact of the water strike.
He was driven out by a fierce warrior who was able to move on the sea, who was once again a professional face-to-face friend.
After the accident, the medical officers took Samuel Tayyar Bajrakczy to the Antalya Education and Research Hospital.
The victim's life was recorded as not to be at the risk of the victim's life.
A friend of the police said, "It hurt his head when he dropped fish from the Kartal Tepesi."
He said, "We didn't expect that to happen."

Two brother-in-laws were killed in battle in the castle.
At ADIYAMAN's Castle Street, two brothers were killed by a gun attack in a car.
The event happened at night on Mustafa Kemal Street.
Ramasan Karahan, 39 years old, headed to the east, opened fire on the basis of an undetected car of 02 KH 839.
Out of the open fire control, the car in Karahan's administration was stopped by another car.
Meanwhile, the man who came to the car, Ramazan and Karahan, fired his brother and his brother after 50-year-old Emer Karahan.
The Karahan brothers, when they were severely wounded, fled from the scene by motorcycle.
Police and health teams were in love with the police instead of the military.
The wounded Karahan brothers were taken to the Kahta State Hospital with an ambulance.
Omer and Ramasan Karahan, who have been treated in an emergency service, have not been saved from all the efforts of doctors.
While the two brothers were talking about the morga for the autopsy, a police officer in the area in which the incident was taking place and checking the security cameras began working to find out who the attacker was.
Britain needs to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow is not only in our local communities and in London, but also in the country.
I think it's going to make Heathrow a very good idea, as in 2012, as we've been trying to provide for the benefit of all the countries and regions of the Games.
The Olympics, Stratford and East End offered great advantages.
And we'll create opportunities for people and companies close to Heathrow and we'll get it back.
Only 10,000 new stations for our local communities will create 40,000 new jobs and we will not leave young unemployed in the atmosphere.
As London has before 2012, those who think that Heathrow's fighting for enlargement is too hard.
I was told that Brittany would never be ready for the Games and we would be ready for the whole world.
Those who heard birds were wrong in 2012 and will see that they're wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow, who raises all his questions.
Heathrow isn't just a few people like the Olympics, it's a subroutine project for many people.
The expansion, 180.000 new jobs and 211 billion economic growth opportunities and the environment leave much to be done in the United Kingdom.
We have a great team to implement an investment of 11 billion euros in time for the world's most intense two-pigs, and for the next five years.
Now, at $16 billion, we're ready for a third pist, supported by special investment.
London 2012 Games have been a great success for the United Kingdom, and there is no doubt that Heathrow's expansion will be the same.
It's time for us to be confident that we will come to trade in the spirit of the Olympics, as Heathrow is expanding, and that we will create a great deal of pride and work for Britain.
Lord Paul Dighton, Head of the Heathrow Administration and former Secretary of the Ticari Department
Adblock Plus, Facebook advertising prevention game like "like a fire-fighting game"
It means "game game" for companies with advertising ban programs for companies that have won online advertisements, according to one of the companies that have banned access to software.
On Friday, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that Facebook advertising can update its filters to prevent social networking.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would make it difficult for advertising to detect which part of the advertising page would change the advertising codes around the world.
But Adblock says now he's solving new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "some of those who are trying to prevent public resources advertising with a crowd of people who are trying to prevent them from doing this have been the result of a repression of advertising since they were created" and that Facebook might produce its own solution in the near future.
The involvement of the world's largest social media company in this struggle shows how much concern for the advertising sector has arisen.
According to Pagefair and Adobe's work last year, nearly 200 million people worldwide are using ads that are disincentived, four times the number of people using this kind of software in 2013.
Mobile ads now generate 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue, with 1,03 billion daily users accessing mobile devices.
According to one dictionary, mobile advertisements are being pursued by social networks because Facebook's mobile applications are not active on the social network and the advertising is not on the company's desktop.
Facebook must be able to provide enough desktop advertisements, as this type of site appreciates sleep.
On Saturday, Facebook announced that people will update the "advertising preferences" tool so that they can better control their ads.
On Friday, Facebook announced that Adblock's new filters were worrying, and that the content of the site's advertising would stop a part.
A Facebook dictionary, in an e-mail document, said, "I don't have a good experience with these people and we're planning to deal with this problem."
Advertisers are a tool that has been shown, so we are focusing on creating tools such as Advertisement Preferences to give control to people.
A woman ran into Switzerland on her way to the car; it looked like an accident.
The victim was sleeping in a car half-night.
The police are looking for people who witnessed a couple of cars shooting at a woman in a car on Friday morning.
The event, right after midnight, arrived in the Vaud canton near Morges, near A1.
The Vaud police said in one of his brains that his wife slept in the dark of the night "in a state of despair" and hit him with several vehicles.
A Swiss woman, 49, who was clearly interested in killing herself, was offered several vehicles to involve a truck.
He lost his life in the event.
The police said that they met with a couple of drivers who were involved in the incident, but that some of them were not identified, and they wanted everyone involved to apply to them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter, Le Tribune de Geneve, explained that "a sentence was opened as a "manual" action to be taken in situations like this."
But the driver involved is not yet aware that he will not face any charges.
Was it possible to escape without a fight?
That's what the lawyer needs to find," Hofstutter said.
It shows that the driver will not be held responsible for two similar cases in the past five years.
In the newspaper, both newspapers (both included a person who went out in the dark) were given a ruling in view of the fact that it was normal for drivers to expect an accident to occur in the car at midnight.
Last year, one night in August 2014, a police officer was found guilty of killing a man who was on his way to Payiner's A1 on the way to death.
The court said that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and was on the way.
The court said that the vehicle of the police was used in an appropriate way to respond to an emergency call and that a man was found on the road "inexhaustible and unforeseeable."
Those who are aware of this incident near Morges on Friday, should call the police on phone number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus used to live in times
According to NASA's new climate model, there was a time-to-live pace in Venus.
NASA Goddard Space Works Institute has developed a model to explore Venus's history using tools and algorithms such as those used by scientists.
Model, Venus was designed to determine whether he did not build a house with the same conditions as Earth with the heat, the waterless surface, and with the CO2-full atmosphere.
Science was telling people that Venus's low turn-in in the past had been explaining the atmosphere.
But the newest ideas are to suggest that Venus may have a world-like atmosphere and that it can return slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of old Venus.
Although there are more areas than Earth, the planet may at times have been able to protect itself from a rapid confrontation with sufficient water and geography.
Old Venus, at the same time, was 30 hours more cheap than a sun.
GISS science man Anthony Del Genio, said in a news report, "The slow conversion of Venus into the simulation of the GISS model has made the sun return to the sun almost every two months."
This also opened the way for the waters that made up the remaining cloud layers that protected the surface of the sun from heat.
As a result, just a few degrees of colder climates in the world today are warming up.
Model made it possible for Venus to create a story like that of Earth's scientists who were supposed to be hypothetical of evolution.
Even though Venus has always had suitable life conditions, over a few billion years, it has become much more fat and light with ultraviolet light.
He blew the ocean into the air, and the water ran out of air with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen was destroyed, and then it was only carbon dioxide that had a deadly effect on the gas, which remained an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, which is what we know today.
Researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy, used by Avalanche's antenna
Patrick Roy used Colorado Avalanche training and hockey operations on Friday, saying that the team had not been given the right to make a decision.
Director-General of Colorado, Joe Sakic, approved this development and indicated that the club would immediately start calling a new coach.
Roy, in his 50s, said, "For the past three years, I have taken over my duties as chief coach and head of hockey operations in Colorado over the last three years."
I've been thinking for a long time about how I can improve and how I can get to a higher level by giving this team the depth they need.
To accomplish this, the horse and the VP hockey operations must be in constant agreement with the visual of the device.
It must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
In the present situation, these steps have not yet been met.
On 23 May 2013, the team thanked Sakic for his team members.
Sakik said, "Patrick informed me of my decision today."
He appreciates everything he does for our creation, and in the future, we have a lot of chance.
Roy and Avalanche were considered the best driver of the league in the first season of 2013-14.
The club won 112 points and provided the team's first finish, but Colorado was transferred to Minnesota in the first round of the play-off cycle, and every two years after the season.
Avalanche made 39-39-4 targets in 2015-16 and received less than five pounds for the second jacker area in the Western Conference.
Roy, on the Honor List, won four Stanley Cup for both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to meet with the grevi soldiers
The North Sea oil workers were arrested for their ransom, and the main negotiators began to negotiate for a new meeting.
Petrol district services are to be conducted in platforms in the North Sea, operated by the Royal Dutch Shell against the Wood Group.
In a joint statement, "We have decided to restart the process for resolving the existing disagreement with the Wood Group as units of the Unit and RMT," he said.
In the weeks ahead, we're going to organize a series of meetings that will take place all day long to create a new perspective on the problems that we're facing from the beginning of the week ahead.
The labour unions said that this protest was still the first action since 25 years.
Wood Group, this year, we're in the market, so the pressure on the passengers in the North Sea made about nine percent cut off.
The company also applied for a 10-percent reduction rate to its carriers in 2014 after the reduction period.
The company said it would provide the company's area to be cut off from the difficult period in the market.
Shell, when the English energy company arranged operations with the BG Group, drove thousands of people out of work and announced plans to quit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low demand for oil prices, resulting from a decision to withdraw from the European Union in Haziran.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson will discuss one of the biggest employees in the North Sea by meeting with the employers this week.
As he said, the North Sea is important for the regional economy.
He said, "We need an active economy for the majority, not for minorities in the North Sea and the country."
Although we've been in the middle of the past five years, it's expected that in 2016 the new projects in the North Sea will have less than $1.4 billion invested.
Peppers, the Earth team's orbital rate of star rotation
Kepler's space telescope, with its last task, has helped the astronomers to create the most inexhaustible directory in the orbits of the stars in the country team's star.
The new data helps the astronomers understand why stars in the constellation's star are changing rapidly and that they can understand the planet's orbits.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Department of Works and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news section, "We hope that a star's mass, age and even the history of the solar system will be able to learn more about the relationship between the past and the future of the solar system."
The country team is 445 light years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in your team's year have been created 125 million years ago and are reaching a new level of accessibility.
They're coming back as fast as they can all their lives.
As they turn around, the stars under this arrangement are creating a huge amount of solar current.
These rays are in the hands of the stars as they progress in the magnetic fields of the stars.
A star turns back in its early years and falls fast.
Keplers, each star's turn-in rate can be distinguished from the sun's rays. They measure the length of the star's appearance.
The last turning point is that larger stars are becoming faster than smaller stars.
Rebull has shown that those who grew up like dancers have made their conversions easier than those who were smaller on their feet.
Rebull said, "The country's slowest returns are harder, and the fast returns are too light stars."
Since the country team is very close to the star, it is the ideal task of a cosmic laboratory to compare the star's speeds with the star's features.
Rebull said, "The country team is providing theoretical models for the turning of stars as young and old as the country team."
There's more we want to know about how the stars turn around, when and why, when they fall, how they're going to fall, why they're leaving 'dance shoes'.
Rebull and his colleagues have explained in detail three new articles to be published in the Astronomy District in the short term for the country team's return rates.
