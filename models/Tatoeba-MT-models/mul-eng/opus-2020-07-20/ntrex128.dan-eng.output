Politicians in Wales are afraid of "like fools"
There was confusion among some members of the Welsh National Assembly about a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (the Wallisian Parliament).
AMs from the entire political spectrum are concerned that the change in name could lead to late settlement.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was worried because "it smells on Twp and Pwp".
For readers without Wales: In Walisically, twp means the ball, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Walisian conservative said that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal flow from MWP to Muppet (fols).
In this context, the Wallis letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter you are spoken in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up a legislative proposal for amendments, said: "The final decision on the names which members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where there was a wide focus on calling the Assembly a Walisian Parliament (Wellsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of AMs, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (Valisian Members) or the WMPs, but the MWP option was largely reflected in a public consultation.
The Am's proposals are likely to offer alternative options, but the fight to reach agreement can be difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to compile a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on reforms contains other changes in the way that the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the Committee system.
The AMs shall have the final vote on what they shall be called when the legislative proposal is discussed.
Macedonians vote on the change in the name of the country
The voters vote on Sunday whether their country's name is to be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade's long struggle with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province on behalf of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours constitutes a requirement on Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjerge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will vote in favour of the vote.
The voters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is just a price paid to be a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's are being held while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I spoke to said that in old days there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No part today."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways today," he said.
"Just don't make the living room of the quarter, where people go on a daily basis."
In relation to the churches, he is concerned that the money acquired to sell assets does not last long, and that they “before or later are back where they started”.
He adds that the church could be replaced by apartment complexes filled with people of the kind who do not help the apartment’s return times.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings are white," he says, "and it adds to the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these properties will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community in 1870 and a quarter later in St. Martin's.
The original methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked closely took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who was in the pit for a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping dogs in Harlem, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Johnson’s son - in - law planned to restore the building, they ordered the clock.
Priest David Johnson, Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, called the watch game "the hour of the poor".
The expert who played the game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a sort of musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been played in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them have been captured by church leaders, others by bishops.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, the Head of the Council of the Council, consisting of senior doctors, wrote to the Bishops' Chamber on concerns that the Bishop would "try to throw the expenses further" to the Council of the Congregation, even if the Council had not been involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who were sent by the Bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Hee hurts 13 years on darker after summers in California
A horse attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy when he fell asleep in California on the first day of the summer season, says officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had slept with friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group ran over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just an urge to have caught a snake, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I was praying!
I was praying!"
"All his demands were reviewed," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone would come out of the water, 'There's a horse in the water!' added Hammel.
The drink was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported critically.
It's unknown what kind of shark attacked there.
Life sentence Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark in the area had been seen a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage on his upper chest.
Agents closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas in 48 hours of safety and to conduct investigations.
It was noted that there are more than 135 haards in the area, but that most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's takes up competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with ranges of beauty products with special assistants in style with large stores.
As part of a major effort to enter the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they show success.
Investment in beauty products takes into account the fact that the supermarkets are leading new products to shelters used in the past for television, microwaves and residential products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing rankings from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also allow more space with fired areas in style with them, seen in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also renegotiates Sorting of Boutique-makeup, so that most products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop is located in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against buying small quantities of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets need to make more people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of the Sainsburys, has said that shops are going to be like large stores, in view of the fact that the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily goods and have made the purchases more profitable.
Previously on the Supermarket, attempts to update beauty and apothecary sections failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but cooperation ended with a clue to how the performance of the pharmacists in the supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their apothecary chain with 281 stores to Celesio, owned by the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury wood fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and the device on our tracks with beautiful products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in particularly trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our fire-fighting committee is designed to meet all the needs and the enabling environment and the practical location means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "responsive" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal to 11 million GBP
Dragons' The star Peter Jones left "responsive", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP with his lifestyle fuel to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their residential product and accessories burn Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop fire.
This Morning-Werten, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' The Star Peter Jones racing, after she's drawn from their luxurious lifestyle in the last minute – to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was "responsive", since the popular TV woman during an active Tuesday meeting at his headquarters in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – meant that she no longer had enough time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop fire and was used to double Willoughby's estimated currency of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly, while Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacations.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would have been a long-term project that she would have been dealing with for the next few decades.
Her decision to move was surprising to all involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the main room in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts consider that the announcement from The Morning Star, which is among the stars of the United Kingdom with the highest performance, can cost the company several million dollars due to large investments in products – all from dust to starlight to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother to three Willoughby and her cousin Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the Governing Council in March.
The two couples take vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be a firebasser for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin who was on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business approach."
Hard talk, "and then we got in love."
He made jokes about the criticism he would have from the media to make a comment which "is not a valuable president" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trup said in his parish at a news store.
"I didn't do anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a more meeting after Trump held their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the Automation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear equipment have been in progress.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "compared reaction" from the United States compared to North Korea's initial response to equipment.
He noted that instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view of the speech at his election meeting.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
"There was an attraction to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve Kim's relationship had produced positive results – the end of rocket tests, the release of hostages, and the sending of Earth's remains from US military personnel.
And he defended his unusual procedure in relation to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this nearby arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes destroy the island and kill several hundred
For example, in the play after the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although over 10 per cent of the population of Lomboks were outside the home, the national disaster situation was not declared as a prerequisite for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, it has unfortunately been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children are bringing together a team to go to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, speaker of the national disaster response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute to emergency aid.
Because of the earthquakes, Indonesia is constantly being exposed, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refugee sites are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view on other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there was apparently no tsunamis, and it probably affected the death scene.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat landfills is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lack of infrastructure a central point in its election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Jokos' administration has been plagued by lack of funding in the context of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experienced pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of confidence.
Over 1,000 people were killed and thousands were taken away from their homes, when Christians and Muslim bands fought on the streets with masks, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge compares at the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a collapse in Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89-minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 metres from Chelsea's target while his hold was behind 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with left foot before he made a high shot against the remotest pillars.
The cloud flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the network.
The cloud dropped over a horrifying Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"It was just about getting in the position to get in the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a simple consultation, and I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at half, after the Belgian stars Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The Chelsea attacker delivered the hall back to Mateo Kovac, before setting up the speed on the middle of the street and printing it on the Liverpool side of the road.
Kovacic made a quick one-to-to on the middle street.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from defense and ended up against the remotest column with a shot with the left foot across Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights with Naples in the team game at the Champions League at 15 o'clock on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 15 Thursday in London.
Deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia rise to 832
The death rate from Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunamis has risen to 832 informs the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
There were reports of many arrests in the walls from buildings that fell after the earthquake measuring 7.5 on the judge’s scale. It struck Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, told the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 38,000 inhabitants, was covered by walls from combined buildings.
Police arrest a man of 32 suspects of murder, after women are tortured to death
A murder investigation was under way, after a woman's law was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something about moving forward.
Police assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of research, but I would invite all those who stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite all, in particular tax authorities, who may have taken up anything with Dashcam to contact us as they can have information that can be decisive for research."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman, if found, is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came over to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The research continues, and the police say that they are being informed of the victims.
A tax officer who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but gets the police to know that no one has to come into the building.
He was shot when he heard what had happened.
The citizens now know there's going to be hours before they can come in again.
A police officer was told to tell a man that the whole area is now considered a place of business.
A crying woman is coming.
She's going to say again, "It's so scary."
At 14 p.m., there were two police cars in front of the bus and another car right outside.
A number of employees were in the meantime and monitored the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call to 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's status of Cromwell will be the last monument to be drawn up by the discussion on the "recording of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic, Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Cricks' proposal as "galsabb" and a "test to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell without the palace at Westminster would be a goal.
The image storm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his ancestors Thomas' actions in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic image of Cromwell is a testimony to the positions of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worth saving.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defence of Parliament against excessive pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one prominent figure representing the one side of the fight.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth holding and remembering."
Dröbergris falls and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a grey on a market in South-West China according to local media reports.
The man who was only identified under his last name "Yuan" was found dead with an overcrowded pulse and bleeding in blood near a greylist on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reports South China Morning Post Sunday.
A gray farm prepares to give gray injects with vaccines at a gray-brown on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his relatives from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 rice on the market.
The next morning his father found him dead and discovered that a door to the church next door was open.
He said there was a big nose with blood in his mouth in Greece.
A medical study confirmed that the 250 kg crisis had caused the farmer to die, according to the report.
"My father's leg was bleeding and tired," said the father, who goes under the nickname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Records from security cameras showed Yuan went into the market at 4.40 Thursday to feed his gray.
His law was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his relatives.
A market leader told Evening News that the crisis had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rares, but there has been a history of cases where Greece has attacked people.
In 2016 a grey woman and her husband attacked their garden in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a total of 295 kg of grass was a Walisian farmer against his tractor, into his wife’s frightened animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his grass in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told him that grass is not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "trigger".
"They're just medical.
The nipples, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa Orc is expected to give heavy rain in much of the southwestern USA
As predicted, the Orcene Rosa will become weaker, as soon as it moves across the cooler waters at the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will give a strong rain with floods in northern Mexico and the southern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1-hour, at 10 Sundays (dansk time) and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is by forming a low-pressure passage across the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. After Rosa approaches the half-way Baya California Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to jump tropically up north into the south-western United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then, the Tropical Führer will be able to interact with the low-pressure transition that will come closer and create a strong rain in the South-West USA in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm rain will create dangerous storms, flowing down and possibly underground in the desert.
The tropical fungus will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to reach 51 to 101 mm of rain in parts of the South-West USA, in particular over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of storms with rapid deterioration due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the wilderness of foot when there is danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn waves into floating streams and droughts will create powerful local winds and create dust floods.</seg>
The low pressure transition, which is approaching, will provide a strong rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk for a total drop of more than 13 mm, which may give fewer quantities of floating drop and smooth path.
This would be the first downturn of the region in their accounting years.
Scattered tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread to the area Four Corners Tuesday and continues on Wednesday.
In October, there can be a great temperature reduction throughout the United States, since the Arctic is colder, but there remains reasonably warm in the troupes.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of a dramatic difference in temperature over the Central American Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the Central and Eastern USA is expected to experience a warm start at October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the south to the parts of the north-east.</seg>
There can be 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate perspective indicates that there is a high likelihood of temperatures over the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million so the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million of them were arrested on Thursday from the designated high station Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was reportedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that broke the ordinary programs to tell about the late development of the peace day: an agreement concluded by Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, who gave the FBI a law to conduct a week-long investigation of the prosecutors.
The Senate's ruling committee told her that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was in a state of shock and tried to take her dress from a gymnasium.
Kavanaugh said in a sensitive statement that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million will see it Friday.
The company appointed average serial numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available serial numbers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a series corresponding to a fight under the NFL playoffs or Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose mind bars have looked heavily upon the appointment of Kavanaugh, was above all stations with an average of 5.69 million soldiers during the hearing that was all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was on the second floor of 3.26 million years ago.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of peace.
After the office of the moderate Republicans sent a statement that he wanted to vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the judging committee.
He was looking down for several minutes while he was being shot out, and CNN sent him alive.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth to the country?"
He got to know, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say during the hearing of the committee.
All the television stations were still alive a few hours later, when the ruling committee would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would go on to a vote for the whole time.
But Flake said that he would only vote for the conviction that the FBI would investigate the defendants against the nominated one next week, which the Democrats, who are in the Senate's submission, had asked for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators next, Fleke took his decision.
The choice of the flag had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "legal policy" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "law politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, the United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview with Theresa May at the front of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal to gather the prices of the United Kingdom and the EU was "very late".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to stand behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of inhumanity, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Employers released videos of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After Simpson's completion, the police said he had witnessed the murder on Wayde.
His deposit is set to $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where there was that the cause of death was an injury from a gun wound that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police lab, Southern University police and citizens in the area has assisted with the research that led to maintenance.
The leader of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for their "emhu and hunt for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "knush" and "in shock" over the death of Wades.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano spy axle over Mexico City
Asche, which is spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern quarter of Mexico’s capital.
The national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to be removed from the volcano after the crater activity and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the room and raised over several rounds.
Social media images showed thin layer of axles on cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south of the capital, since a earthquake measuring 7.1 on the correctional scale took place in September 2017 in central Mexico.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police meet with Catalan separatists before the vote on independence
Sex was arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrations of independence, accompanied by the opium officers, with thousands of participants in rival demonstrations marking the first year of Catalonia's polarist vote on resolution.
A group of masked separatists held back, threw and powder milling and created dark dust bags on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also similar targets later on the day when the police used their letters to hold the battles down.
Over several hours, independent groups called "No Forgetd, Not Forgived", and were met with Unionist demonstrators, who called "Long Life in Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests reported the local press.
The vote continued to be high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but was celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The voters voted in excess of independence, but the electoral association was low, and those who were opposed to the resolution voted in a large-scale manner.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote during violent meetings at voting sites throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the withdrawal of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer lacks hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy that they had the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they received a sneeze, but importantly, in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain the moment, and many of their best known leaders are either moved into exile or in detention and wait for their role in the observance of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took the protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be more and more tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who had been waiting for his case since last year, announced that he would vote for the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to avoid the return to democratic values and the humiliation we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house framed by car
Three men in 33, 34 and 39 were arrested, after a car several times they entered a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It may also have been removed from the back of the car at a time.
Scotch from Menga gives Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first target for Livingston guaranteed victory
The survivors of Livingston defeated Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference, when Gary Holt's team jumped across the side with Hibernian on the other side.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league in this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they are sitting eight points after next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Livingston builds up their undisputed strip for six battles, and Captain Holt has not yet received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash out
Holt's attitude would have been long before, the scored, and their direct game style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow accidentally hit without the target, after he pleased to frame Craig Halket's cross-sectional head before the target.
The housekeeper was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could solve the problem of death.
And it was under the circumstances that the important objective came.
Rangers started free parking, and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together set up for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the Boldpower, but fought to get through the defense of the household, and Mr Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos took a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's murder was rejected with the births of Ranger's target man Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was shot outside the framework under another of Livingstone's deaths.
There were ongoing deliverys in Livingstone's Field, but they were rejected, and two requirements for a criminal park – after Halket's consent to the exchange of Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenominal" from Livingstone – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenemonal efforts and strong results for Livingston.
All played fantastically and exceed the expectations of their upcoming trip.
Their style of play and body has been largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has maintained his strength since he reached it.
There were a lot of crazy people.
Supposed Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and many held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the streets throughout the fight.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerard, but they played under level.
Their conclusions lacked scarphed – only once they got their own home – and it is a great wake-up for Rangers, who is in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cold
There was a soft and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen over areas such as human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's approaches to the EU.
Erdogan then took to the Cold to open a new, big Moscow.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police, for security reasons, had a population of 25,000 from gathering in front of Moscow, but many of the supporters appeared close to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of whom were Kurdish, also noted and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to oppose the country.
The competitive protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as one of some German Turks and the corner as one of the cars of others.
Hiking on the road in Deptford: Cyclist dies in combination with car
A cycle list is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the ground.
The accident takes a few months after another cycle list died in a crash with a car that runs away from the scene on the Children's Street, about 1.6 km from the day of the accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the police officers were working to identify the man and inform him of his case.
There have been road crossings, bus routes have been refurbished, and motorists are encouraged to stay out of the area.
Long Lardin Prison: Sex served under uro
Six prison officers have been injured during the watches in a high-security prison according to the Prison Office.
There was an hour in the HMP Long Larsin prison in Worcestershire about 9.30 BST Sunday, and loyalty is still running.
The Specialized "Tornado" official has been introduced to handle the officers, who are involved in eight arrests and are in one flight of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor eye damage on the ground.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been tried to deal with the current irregularities in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the officials are being notified to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 victims, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after an arrest.
And in October last year, the U.S. officer was called to the prison to deal with serious dishonesty, where employees were attacked with billiards.
The Orcene Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm flood ( dry areas can bring benefits)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to reach Arizona, but it is most likely to occur in the beginning of the next week when the rest of the Orcian Rosa move over the rural landscape in the south-western United States and create a risk of storms.
National Weather Service has already sent warnings of storms for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "the Tropical Cyclones had maintained their status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an Orc within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurrine Center foresee 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern desert region, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will likely be 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For them without risk of flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Overcrowding is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the accounts will benefit because the South-western United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the closest category," reports weather.com.
First, the Orcene Rosa is expected to frame country on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has energy power on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north with 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls strong.
It is therefore expected to be covered in Mexico with tropical electricity Mondays or evenings.
The rain on parts of Mexico can become strong and pose a serious risk to obesity.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, before the border to Arizona early on the morning of the Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move through Arizona and enter the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or the rest of it is very severe rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the USA," National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening torrents and flowing down in the deserts, as well as the soils in mountain ranges.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton: Fire detained for murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were detained under suspicion of murder, after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton about 4 BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset.
The Agency has invited all those who need to have mobile records of the events to come forward.
Trup says that Kavanaugh was under the "dangerous and angry" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the free and dishonest tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at an election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been exposed to the "revelation, anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness before the convention on Thursday and strongly complained and felt guilty by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexual intercourse with her for many years since they were teenagers.
Because he also gave a witness in the hearing of his complaints.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the dignity, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most powerful legal brains in our time, a jurist with a wonderful past in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the meeting of Republicans at the polls during the Middle East elections.
"Five weeks are one of the most important choices in our life.
You can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "fight against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place at the latest Friday, a person placed in the Republican party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the death toll growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were forced away from fighting waves that hit the beach, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at a time of drought, drowned many in death, and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami was born after a earthquake measuring 7.5 on the judge's scale.
"When the tsunami broke last night, people were still running on the beach. They didn't run the same and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, the car tied up, trees, house, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
To survive by climbing trees to escape tsunamis, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, destroyed and combined brothers and a Moscow surrounded by water.
Afterwards, the coastal town continued to rise on Saturday.
The wave of earthquakes could be seen in a region of 2.4 million people.
In a report, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT) said that the energy released during the great earthquake of peace was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima during World War 2.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, small bug, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "absorbed" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were managed together.
The bodies of a number of victims were found firmly in the walls of the combined buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been damaged and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and the damage could be larger along the 300 km long coastal line north of Palu, the area of Dodrea, located near the epicenters of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely lambed without information" from Dodrea, said Nugroho.
"There are over 300,000 here," said Red Cross in a statement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
On Saturday the government was criticized from many fronts not to disclose that a tsunami had struck Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur occupations, shared in social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building that is desperate to steal warnings about the tsunami coming closer to the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water falls on the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings with the same.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great wave of power to shut down the communication about Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has started sending cargo flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, notifying authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic supplies among the evacuated.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for aid work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision staff from Dodhea have come safely to Palu City, where employees are looking for light during exhibitions in the garden at their account. They came across areas with extensive destructions along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they were so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organisations began to work in the Baltic Sea by reintroduction, there were complaints that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, economic support, supplies and workers from abroad must only come in if the area where the disaster has occurred is declared nationally.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of peace, friends and family stood firm in the hope that their neighbors would become the miracles that light the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled up by a clock.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped in a garbage dump for two days with her mother’s bed beside herself.
Gendon Subbandono, the Indonesian paragliding country coach, had trained two of the missing paraglids to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were arrested at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandigi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how he, after the news of the co-operation of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in a paragliding circuit, had unexpectedly sent whatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were at the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray flue instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Tive takes $26,750 while filling in Newport on the Level
Tive stole Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink's agent, who was filling up a Newport on the Level, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The car driver had cleaned up the money car in the maintenance complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote the press officer Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, another man ran "on the back of the Brink's staff" and stole a tape that would have been delivered.
So many suspects fled the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All with information on the identity of the tires are requested to contact the police in Newport on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes the name to Ye.
He announced the shift on Twitter, where he wrote: "We were once known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had named Ye for a short time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singing Ariana Grande on show, as a result of "sympathetic reasons", said the show's creators.
The name is abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier in the year when he discussed his album title with the Big Boy radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but in the year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
One of the former partners of West, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the bond is involved.
Mexico's AMLO does not promise to use military force against civilians
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, newly elected President of Mexico, has never promised to use military power against civilians, as the country is nearing the 50th year of a blood strike against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza that he "would never use the military to undermine the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration at the site on 2 October 1968 and killed 300 at a time when left-directed student movements hit many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and open several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
After China becomes more active within artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use in field research, says investors and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come from various parts of the US Government, however, to provide information on artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation by 2030 at the latest.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far back in relation to the United States, and we are looking for the next major infringement within the AI," said Lee.
Redoubled the budget could double the chances that the next major performance would be achieved in the United States in artificial intelligence, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Hughton Mifflin Harcourt and is the managing director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most outstanding companies in the field of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the top ranked American Othello players, and later he was the leader of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the American government, such as Robotics Challenge, which was held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next viewers could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get leagues from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that replaces the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employed in recent years as star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs within artificial intelligence must have offered work permits.
The Chinese State Council sent their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people on academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence to involve industrial and research partners, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation trying to establish a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has remained standing for several months.
Macedonians vote on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on whether their country's name should be changed to the "North Republic of Macedonia", a measure that would solve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province on behalf of Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring countries to the north constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has therefore used their vector when Macedonia has sought NATO and EU membership.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but nationalist opposers believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the main Macedonian slave population.
President Gjerge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has created doubts as to whether the vote will be the 50 % required to be valid.
The question on the vote was, "Are you a NATO and EU member with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
In addition to the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, it is considered a price worth paying to create connections such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the EU's umbrella, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the vote and do so.
The amendment would require a majority in Parliament on two thirds.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 p.m. no irregularities were reported.
However, only 16 per cent of the electoral participation was compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We are at home in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country that would open up for NATO and EU membership in Struca in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and took a seat in front of the hall, which was set up by those who wanted to vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with a strong flag, not with the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a strong investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think a large majority will vote for because over 80 per cent of our citizens are going to join the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "secure of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the required electoral participation.
Another assessment carried out by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57% of the respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Out of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote is wrong, it will be the first major political loss for the pilot government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero struggle through the entire Bridgeton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Bridgeton defense in Manchester Citys 2-0-win Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look slightly easy with his score, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attack received a delivery on the middle street at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenses before he broke out on the open road.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green wheels.
He fought over one defense, followed by several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English president used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right thumb to list Brighton target Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with the children," City Manager Pep Guardiola told the reporters.
"We talked about he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate break in the Premier League.
The target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got into the next ball deeper into Brighton's territory.
He sent a great delivery along the left bank to Leroy Sane.
True took a couple of consultations before he led Sterling against the remotest pillars.
Sky Blues forward pointed the ball in the net just before it was glad over the target.
The city fights against Hoffenheim in the team game at Campion's League at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
The screensaver will drop Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the caste Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a chance to participate in the playoffs for Rockies, which has played a fight more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild card slot with a 5-2 victory over National Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the fight well aware that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the public here in Denmark, and that the opponents would play at the highest level, I'll stand up for this year.
Why wouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet reported the start-up for Sunday, but Scherzer will probably put Scherzer in a situation like that.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the beach for the 34th time, trained his cast Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his holiday.
The right-hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump holds a election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation about his election to the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the meeting of Republicans on the voting sites at the Central Elections.
"Everything we've done is in play in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the great, great – you can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me. That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you can see, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to get the power back with all the resources available. You can see how vicious they are.
They're equal to who they hurt, who they're going to drive to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have as a mission "fight against and blockers".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "screaming and malicious and malicious and lying."
He mentioned the highest democratic senator in the Senate's ruling committee, Diane Feinstein, on behalf of which he released a loud message from the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you copy the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
The lab is no longer a romantic party.
They are intolerance to those who express their views
Since Moment's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not really a surprise.
I am only the last of a number of Members from the Labour House who have been informed that we are not welcome – only because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship went out to criticize me because I was against Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, with regard to national security, in Europe, there are ironic problems similar to those of Jeremy's former leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour Friday there was that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a local parliament member, the meetings have been like this on Friday night.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not so, and the law on "friendly, smarter" policy is far behind in the past, if it ever came into effect.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Office and that all opinions are considered whether the party's management can accept them.
Soon after, Jeremy was led, when my former colleagues, whom I believed to be politically involved, began to expect that I would make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would never have agreed on – whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it is really very much what I say – it follows a long series of serious reports on the social media that call for the rejection and opposition of the medium-term policy and tells me that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the fight against my fellow Members, who are subjected to sexism or racism every day, but still fight further.
One of the most shocking aspects of this political era is where abuse has become common.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labor would create a tolerant culture.
In reality, however, there is no longer a romantic organization and with each miscellaneous vote or change of election rules, the party becomes smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and not so high-strengthening, then I'm going to "I'll be all right".
But that is not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of the Labor 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government to leave our classroom in a state of emergency, and I set myself up to provide better public services for those who need it most — regardless of whether it has been a council member or a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and differences with the current leadership.
To those who submitted the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country comes forward against Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Director of Labor.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters whether they are members of the Labor or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to elections or political fitness will prevent me from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Year 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsatisfied Ayr becomes superseded
Two later scorings may have had the final result of drawing an entirely unverified picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this fantastic entertainment match of the day in Tennt's Premiership.
They are now on the top of the scoreboard and are the only undisputed ten.
Finally, it was as high as their relative defenses as their better use of the chance that had taken home, and Peter Murchie had the absolute right to be satisfied.
"Our fight has been demanding so far, and we are still unsatisfied, so I need to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "Regarding Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful score from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr forward, but a gold card to Scottish country player Rory Hughes, who was assigned to the Warriors fight, gave Melrose a advantage, and Jason Baggott made a score that was not followed by a score.
Climo built Ayr's engagement with a criminal park just before the half-way. He scored and then got a solo score, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, which was followed up by a park from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
Then there was a long break because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was taken out of the road on the bar. When the game was re-arrived, Ayr started with a scoring from Stafford McDowell and a subsequent park from Climo.
Functioning Ayr agent Blair Macpherson then received a gold card, and Melrose again used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without subsequent parking after a period of intense pressure.
However, the housekeeper came back, and when Sruan Hutchinson got a yellow card to thank Climo without the ball, MacPherson could follow a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr kid.
Climo followed up with a park inside the chairs and followed up with a more close after, the game was re-embraced, after Kyle Rowe discovered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flight players Gregor Henry left to the fifth score of the bus home.
Set game stars to look for new careers in the catering industry
The Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to take the step to the restaurant, after it has become apparent that he has taken the lead post for an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The Duoen has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and that Kiernan plans a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of the Operation Mortgage Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, but a source pointed to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "increasing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": The state of Bolivia hopes that the Court will reopen its route to the Pacific Sea
The seamen patrol around the fleet’s main rooms, which are trapped in rivers, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a sea blue flag.
The flag base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River has been overemphasized with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In all the country of Bolivia, a coastal route that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict on resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same length is after sailing on the Pacific again.
The expectations may be at the top of them for several decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years' vote.
"Bolivia has a moment, a feeling of community and clarity, and naturally waits for a positive view of the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will provide Bolivia with its content that Chile, after several decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate the sovereignty of Bolivia over a area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who stands for a controversial election campaign next year, also has much to do with the trial of Monday.
"We are ready to return to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which is sitting in the Netherlands, has no power to extend the Chilean territory and has provided that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given back.
"The matter of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' warlord has done it with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in Haag, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "close an era of 139 years with differences and benefit for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political offence.
"Bolivia will never grant access to the Pacific," he added.
"The Court's task is an opportunity to see that we've overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear weapons are not coming unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never defeat their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust in Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to comply with the commitments made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were extended to the fact that US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a relaunch of the fixed nuclear diplomat over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "demand dream" to continue sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will sometimes bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is standing against the declaration, so long as Pyongyang has not taken a significant step against decommissioning.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump will have a more summit.
But there has been widespread suspicion as to whether Pyongyang is serious about removing an arsenal, which the country is most likely to see as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hate collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne promised on the catwalk the lock for a collection of remarkable main clothing in an extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by Paris Fashion Week.
Very ineffective had dominated Instagram in summer, and the two designers have sent their visual creations down to the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a superabundant with a four-dimensional shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewellery and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a selection of strange masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined leathers that remembered more about Hannibal Lecter than skin coat.
One creature looked like a thicker grain with snorkel and mask, and the other looked like a crushed waffles.
And if you continue the great fashion states, you're lucky.
Sculptors predict that the huge ones could have come to shops near you.
The battle lines arrive in the halls of "La Bomba", the train with a 60 cm wide shadow that is seen all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark behind the highest unencumbered hate, which has been spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down to the catwalk – a beach bag in the stream, which is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange bast bag with bast hair and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told the F.C.C.: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the next summer in ordinary shops. The designer has been so influential that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in combat."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic results behind them, and in 2018 there is still a number of unique exam results, which are strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools are running, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), after providing the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a training sector that can combine and implement a dissident pension, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that's the chapter.
If you talk to him in his own language, it's the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just hold ourselves in English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see on the latest exam results in the year that language is the highest in statistics with most existing exams in independent schools.
In all 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received high quality A.
The data collected by SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72% of students had the character A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also had an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences, which will naturally require children and young people in the future.
Language is now considered the subject choice at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school minds and other places.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that, among the reasons why employers could not have free positions, 17% had lack of language skills to do.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More jobs will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great benefit in the future with a life - giving skills like this.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a break for competitors.
According to a YouGov measurement of over 4,000 respondents in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
It is therefore important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are given a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools vary in what language they are taught in.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be the most important for Britain when it comes to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills required to succeed regardless of what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the country's future in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this emphasis on Scotland's youth.
You need to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets a debut for Lakers' Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James plays in the Sunday's opening game before the season starts against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's playing.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell questioned that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans relative to Lakers' planned six matches before the season.
"Where I am in my career I don't have to fight before the start of the season to be ready," he said.
Trips election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election meetings last night in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is the first out of five planned election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's judgments to the sitting of the high court has been put into effect, Trump is attempting to draw attention to the forthcoming midway elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia last night, and how do you view it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (dansk time) between Saturday, 29 November and Sunday, 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's selection meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's talks about Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the highest level. The hearings were charged because of complaints about sexual harassment, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been taken into account for a week while the FBI is investigating the complainants.
But the main objective of this series of elections is to create a moment for the Republicans who are facing a very high election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign said that the five elections next week aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when the Republicans try to protect and build the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control over the Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we are entering the busy campaign," said a speaker for the Trump campaign, who would not be cited by name, to Reuters.
Tonight's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the measurements.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to climb up to give him a boost in the measurement," said Simon Haeder, who works with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown the campaign and is trying to keep the hope alive for Sunday's single-day holiday
After three unilateral rounds, it may have been that this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging moment pendulum is a whole through the undisputed sport concept, but a concept which players believe is – not at least at competitions like this.
Where would they say there's a moment now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we see it a little bit like a moment," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the Thursday.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in the streets, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can both talk with three points of four possibilities.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his roommates.
The high jumps were higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important foot, which ensured victory in due four, even though he and Thomas had been two shots behind two dulls.
His foot, which assured them of the fight on the 15th floor, was met with a similar cry – the kind of cry that shows that he does not think that the American stand is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players are back now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable but sympathetic couples have received four points in four wars, and there is a misunderstanding.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine Friday mornings.
The series and the way the energy appears to fly both to and from the wild audience shows that it is they, it will be hard to fight Sunday. And it would certainly be very popular if a potential European victory is determined by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Allerhelst's synchronous on every corner of their hole.
However, it is too early to speak of European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial against Sergio Garcia, the next morning in the company dealers, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the svenger down in a hole, which they never were near to get out.
Sunday there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The games with four balls and two slots a two players are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better than ever and has created a significant task before the last day, but the company dealers have also shown that the team USA has the most fighter, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates 10-6 events last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of the day's four-day ball and foursomes with an overstatement of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and has so far received four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European stand, trying to win the pocal they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an upright American stand in the morning's fourballs and water series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in foursomes, they won four battles, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's container shall use eight points in the 12 single bags of the sun if they are to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who has won four points in the race, and he and Molinari, who together have received the nickname "Molliwood", is after a sentimental weekend it's just another couple in the Ryder Cups story who has won four points in their first four battles.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then flew elegantly a motif Woods and the American debuter Bryson Dechambeau with a more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought during the first two fights on Sundays, had a small genius, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in three.
Justin Rose was at the end of the morning's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stanson in foursomes and received a 2--1-win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number three in the world.
However, Europe has as much as they would like to have, on a light shining day in the southwestern part of Paris.
Thirty-two Major Winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They got a strong 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later turned back and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It is only two times in the Ryder Cup story that a team has fought back after being back with four points before the single champions. When Furyks currently has the pocal, however, they should only be able to keep it.
However, after having a second job for two days, it seems that they cannot master a motherfucking Sunday.
North Korea says they will not fall unilaterally if there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would strengthen their mistrust to the United States and that the country would not release their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Heritage Organization that North Korea had developed a "significant welfare" within the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and mishylitis, deploring an area of nuclear testing and law not to further develop nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"With no confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and fall unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" access to nuclear equipment, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took step-by-step steps, but his speech proved important since it did not simply deny unilateral equipment, as it had previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between a former US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atom equipment on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's safety.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first issue their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to the bloodshed of international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on 'atom equipment first' and builds pressure with sanctions to achieve their objectives by force and even counters 'the declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to shame is a dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our miscellaneous nature."
There were no plans for a more summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader raised by the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If nuclear equipment were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so fixed."
However, the tone in Ris was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that breaking North Korea's rockets against the United States was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trup in the United Nations threatened with "total recovery" of North Korea, but in the year he rose Kim to protest against fraud, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions must remain until North Korea's downturn.
On our day, Trump said that he didn't have a schedule for these measures, but he said, "It's very much, if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear equipment."
Since 2006, the Security Council has consistently increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the side line during the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there had been progress, while North Korea just a few hours after accused him of making "aggressive demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and an atomic complex if the United States took "a similar step."
He said Kim had told him that the "similar steps", he demanded, were the security promises Tromp gave in Singapore, as well as movements against normalization of the relationship to Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all Bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to master the growing macho culture, where you study all night, kept up with large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best universities often do not know the first thing about self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was given the idea of the course after having kept a record of the effects of sleep failure on education.
"When the job was done, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get this first to know now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time in the year, explains how good sleep habits can improve the academic and sports performance and the overall well-being of the students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course consists of different interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college hall where students should click on coffee cups, gardens, walkers and books to learn about the effects of coffee and light, how even sports performance is affected by sleeplessness, and how important sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants learn how sleep deprivation over time increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We are well aware that it will not change the students' behaviour in the same way.
But we think they have the right to know it - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking a "allnight" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have led to the fact that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and fear is good and enough sleep, he said – it even affects weight gain, because sleeplessness makes the brain believe that it is hungry for the constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler last year to organize the course when he took one of his courses for his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next one will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up an alarm so they know when to sleep and when to wake up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of electronic screens, which can smoke at lunchtime and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Targets from Many Scanker Gerrard and co.
Ranger's lead was another downhill on the outside, when Dolly Mengas' goal meant that Steven Gerrard's unique hold had to be taken with a downcast at 1-0 in Livingstone.
The hold from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the outdoors since the 4--1-trium at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holts held it in the second floor in 18 coaches. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Many hits for seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangershold could not answer.
Rangers now smokes on a sixth floor, while Livingston demands up on a third floor after Hibernian with only the target score to different.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, when line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a cast object, which seemed to come from the outer section.
Gerard made eight changes in the setting that achieved Betfed Cups semi-finals by tuning over Ayr.
Instead, Holt stood with the same 11, who barbed a point of Hearts' performance in the last week, and he would have been afraid to see his sharp attitude mastered the resistance across the road.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should've scored two minutes in the fight, when the Mengas first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregors' goal, but the middle-way player's attempt to pass.
A free park in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow jumped across the lowest hill.
However, Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
In any case, Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson informed the Colombians' appeals for a criminal park, when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter.
Rangers had only two shots at targets in the first half, but former Rangers targetman Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head wound and Ovie Ejaria's stupid shot.
Although Lewis opening in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said that it is worth their effort alone.
No one could handle the death of Rangers in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily shoot it in target.
In the break, Gerard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave power when the fly player sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from its position to block.
But Livingstone forced him to play on their prizes with many long balls up on the streets of Lithgov and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the movement in the final part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with his right hand before Lithgow joined the target.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton called again for a late prison park after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Architect: Founder of the Gegilter
And now a page from the annual book "Sunday Tomorrow": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we are TÉLLER... – was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger found a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that would eventually lead to the device known as the gegitator.
The Gegiertttler has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main figures as the Polish scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these main phones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans, "Stop it now, there's going into it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he wanted to fill 63.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
The new cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can learn immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches immunodeficiency to recognize cancer cells as a result of treatment
The method is to extract immunity from a patient and change them into the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many forms of cancer and where they are reinjected
A test vaccine appears promising in patients with a number of forms of cancer.
When a woman with breast cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune defense to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immunity from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which has many forms of cancer, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "has various forms of cancer to develop", including breast, ear, lungs and brain cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when taking immunitys from patients and "learn" them to attack cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech introduced a MAGA-hat after its SNL performance.
It wasn't good.
After a unique event in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was relieved when he welcomed the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would stand up as presidential candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third music Ghost Town last night, he had introduced a Make America Great Again box, he started a wonderful fight against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so much about white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I'd be the longest from the United States," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's trial panel on Christine Blasey Ford's case.
Although the recordings were not shown, comicist Chris Rock Wests drew on the social media.
It's uncertain whether Rock tried to expose the West by putting up the records.
In addition, West complained to the public about poor treatment backstage due to its main clothing.
"They motivated me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hate."
They got me!
And they said that I was drunk," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I am?" and said that he would take his Superman hat on because it means "You can't decide what to do.
Try with love."
The public rented at least two of his comments, and the SNL staff allowed to be very involved, explains Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomb in the studio."
West had been booked as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, if the current boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had arrived a few days earlier.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received feedback from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who questioned: "To one of the bravest people: TAK FOR NOT TO LADE YOU OF THE PROBLEM."
Talkshow-warn Karen Hunter questioned that the West only "is what he is, and it's very nice."
"But I don't choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his dress or his "art"), who captures and exploits an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's got a law.
And that's what we have," she added.
Before show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a change of name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who has changed his name, and follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapcolon Snoop Dog has been known as Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical prince changed his name to a symbol and so to The Artist Formly Know as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington extended by toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to swing sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent middle-aged fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress is extending out after the stereotyping macho hero and says that the kind of TV characters mean that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he thought there was "something wrong" and asked how to handle the problem with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, recently married to his Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem is "very close to him".
"I've been in a lot of trouble since then – where have we gone wrong in town with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the problems we are dealing with, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculinity.
He continued, "What is born, and what is born?"
What is it that young men learn from the television and on the street that makes them feel they should be men in this way?
I think it is one of the big issues of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something went wrong with the young men."
During the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not make follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and said that he is "completed with arrows and horses".
Kit has since November been involved in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a movie director and his brother who is deaf.
The shooter discovered too recently that he considered it to have met his wife Rose as the best of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my next family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kitt's character, Jon Snow, is being loved in, in the Amy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China has published a 14 % increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, it is heard by the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way has been reduced to something close to zero, telling Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT environment of China.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT-people is, according to a growing phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry before or after women because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to a lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicines as a attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters deny that staff collected data on Republican senators and torrents against "hazardous lies" and "conspiration theories"
A member of the representative's House Maxine Waters stated in the Sunday's charges that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the claims came from websites and supported by "the Supreme Right Arrow".
"false, false, and many terrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter account.
The published information contained listed address and phone numbers on the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. It took place during a hearing in the Senate on sexual harassment against the so-called Brett Kavanaugh.
It happened after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been provided by Waters people, and then published information about a member of Water's staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded charge is completely useless and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is not in any way responsible for this doctor of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely useless and a direct lie."
Waters' release quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's a rage of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It means that she does not have the right temperature to be a member of the Congress.
If you are accused of something you haven't done, you don't have to be angry.
You don't have to be sad.
There is no need to question the complainant's motives.
You must keep the sentence."
Fleischer allowed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Kavanaugh, who were criticized for being too angry during the Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to take Waters' place in the Central street committee, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Dear, if it's true," he questioned.
In Water's official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the governing authority on these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be kept legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Notification by Johnny English to re-adjust – stunning spin comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to follow a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British Isle, and it also seems relevant to the newest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Do you want dry, sarcastic self-sacrifice, as soon as it is with us, to become the new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has been allowed to make fraternals again. His name indicates more than anything else that he is a comical invention directed towards places where biographers do not speak English.
Of course he is the dumb secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a small Clouseau, a knife-spin Mr. Bean and a proper dress by him, who presented a single tone to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international luxury book that left chaos in his cold water, after Atkinson filmed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot at the JE tribe.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying a medium-age equipment, and the propellers shouted against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite stunning and amazing, especially now that more "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor makes it more likely to be directed towards children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's short adventures are not just as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stupid films about the role of Mr. Bean.
The ongoing starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-level spy network and revealed the identity of all the English agents in the field of abuse of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and combating prime minister who has already suffered a complete decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been discovered, she needs to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it is Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of school of Rock training in spying.
English rushes back to a crisis conference at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-tested previous right hand Bugh, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married with an overcrowded but well-being bottom line – a role that Vicki Pepperdine played.
This is how the royal service is already humble Batman and Robin back when they meet Olga Curylenkos beautiful five fatalities, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is very close to getting involved with the charismatic and carefree tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their racing risk-filled escapes: Precisely as servants, they set fire to a front French restaurant; they create chaos, as they swim themselves on the board at Voltas lussusyacht; and English creates pure ragnarok when he tries to use virtual reality-brakes to make himself known to the Voltas house.
All cannons are created in the final sequence of the film, but how well and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television about it.
Right in the middle of the day.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking about the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talented justice?
Labour refuses to barge with a four-day job plan with constant pay for the British
Jeremy Corbys Labor is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be satisfied with a four-day job, but pay for five.
The Party will indicate that it will have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days' work week without going to pay.
Source says that the idea would agree with the party's economic objective to draw the country into a more favourable direction for workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day job as a way for workers to benefit from an economic change.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal was expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It is not going to happen one day, but a quarter of a day's work is a goal that is consistent with the party's ability to change the economy for the benefit of the workers and the party's overall strategy for industry."
The work would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day workshop during the election campaign to the parliamentary committee in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A quarter-day worker is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour Minister of Shadow Finance John McDonnell used a party meeting last week to record his plans for a socio-economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to withdraw power from "anonymous directors" and "users" in supply companies.
The plans of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also strike doubts as to whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, since a government with Labor in the spring could "modre" them because of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to have employees in business management and to create an inclusive own fund to distribute 10 per cent of the private companies' share value to employees who are about to receive up to 500 euros a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their vote
The FBI investigation on charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has issued the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that took place on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could record something that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy allowed himself to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went in to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was steel, specific and unique."
Rather, Graham's voice seems to be in the rock.
"I have decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and another would require a very violent charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Bret had it on the most powerful," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it would change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and it has done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City host town for the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park's large plan, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal that is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that is fighting to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP image), concertists must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, make voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can give attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But where successfully has Global Citizen been, now where have they been back 12 years to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really change, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" – that people feel that they make a difference by signing a subscription collection on the web or making a Twitter account?
Global Citizen notes that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have urged world leaders to make binding objectives and policy measures equivalent to more than $37 billion, which are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 objectives and measures that have been achieved for their actions, which have already been paid or collected in excess of $10 billion.
The group estimates that these resources have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which is started in England and is a cooperation between investors and people with difficulty. They strive to "help children with their full potential" and promises $35 million to solve nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, other governments and citizens of the world like you, social injustice can be a footnote in the history books," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online invitations. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will snibble and make mistakes.
But as with the movement of citizenship and the movement against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are among the guests at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are to be guests.
U.S. can use its flag to "block" Russian energy exports, says the US Interior Minister
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, even in the Middle East, revealing US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke to Washington Examiner.
Zink claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria – in particular where they operate on an invitation from the judicial government – is a benefit to expand the sale of their energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And he says there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"U.S.A. has our flat opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the shores, and if it is necessary, we can also block them, so we can ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization that considers itself "the voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to managing Russia and Iran, and said that they are in the bottom and the base.
"The economic opportunities for Iran and Russia are dealing with the use and replacement of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These opinions are based on the intention of the Trump administration to increase the European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is the most cheap choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, speakers of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "fence".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion North Stream 2 animal management, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of different competitive conditions and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the American Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, BDI, has asked the United States to mix outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party joining our energy supplies," said BDI leader Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "surprising strongly" to join the presidential committee in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts "surprisingly" to appoint the presidential committee after the midway committee, she said on Saturday.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering stopping.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider setting up the presidential committee."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump to know under the board and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing at our democracy," she said.
Warren has been speaking in his criticism of Trump and his host named Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Tuesday Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI should examine the case before the vote."
However, a measurement from Thursday shows that the main part of Warren's own band does not think it should be set up in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be set up.
32% supported the possible candidate.
The assessment showed greater feedback to former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against possible recovery.
Other highly-professional democratic candidates who are discussed with the Presidential Committee in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Biden says he's reporting his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin names Track Palins PTSD at a selection meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after reporting to the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with violence at home.
"What my own son is going through, after he's home, makes it possible for me to relate to other families who are aware of the consequences of PTSD and other damages our soldiers are returning home," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his presence for "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become stronger. They go and think about whether they are respected for it, their colleagues on the ground and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was sentenced to violence in the home against a woman, to prevent the notification of violence in the home and to have a weapon in his condition, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support against new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Colombia support a legal objection to a new American law that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-dependent statement to support an asylum seeker who is contrary to the law hear it from NBC News.
The author's full name in the case of Justice Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons, who are bandits," had abused her, but American officials dismissed her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers come, as countries with considerable problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum law adopted a decision of the 2014 American alien name, which allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Colombia's state attorney, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "is removed from the state, federal and international law of the years."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such a barrier is contrary to the principle," states the party-dependent statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on refusal of immigrants would damage the American economy, as it is more likely that they will become self-employed and "give needed labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions deplored the right of immigration judges to give asylum to victims fleeing from violence in the home and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," said Sessions in their announcement of the law on 11 June.
It has never been the idea that asylum would solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the death rate doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu despair
For survival, the situation was only worse.
"It's very exciting," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little febrile boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in straight.
We don't have enough water."
The inhabitants now returned to their destroyed home to sort in blood and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also affected by earthquakes of 7.5, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated on the outside for a cause of great regret.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughters.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masturbating against a ruined wall, I think," said Haras to Associated Press and added that his family was going to marry in town.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador, China accuses China of fine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper, a fireman's ad in an American daily paper that hit the drum for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador in China Beijing blames for using the US press to spread propaganda.
The American President, Donald Trump, referred to China on Wednesday paid an impression in Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best selling newspaper – after having accused China of mixing in Congress on 6 November. China rejects the charges.
American officials tell Reuters that Trump's charge of Chinese interference in the American elections marks a new phase in Washington's scaling campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now clearly in a evasion trade war, where they have made import duties on each other in several contexts.
China's opposition to the trade war would form the framework for exporters in such countries as Iowa, which supported the Trups Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, former governor of China, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Brandstad wrote in a director of the Des Moines Register of Sunday that China "takes the use of the infinite methods by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of expression by driving a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the Czechs here in Beijing, however, only a few disagrees will be found. And you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article even though he did not say who.
Republicans present women before the midway committee with the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
Many top Republicans support and defend the so-called Brett Kavanaugh against charges of sexual abuse, warn analysts that they will experience a moderate reaction in the coming midway elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the kitchen, and most Republicans have already published that they wish to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done," said Grant Reher, professor of State Studies at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an 11-hour FBI investigation would slow down the election.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, who is senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive movementOn group, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called at a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says it from Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will come to a new height," said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the press.
"People say it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can now be even higher, especially among female voters in the ancestors and younger voters – 18-29 years of age – who rarely vote, despite not being able to like the president."
Even prior to Ford’s public charges of sexual abuse of the so-called wholesaler, analysts had indicated that it could provide backlogs if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become worse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, in the beginning of the last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final outcome, or about Kavanaugh being held responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," notes Guy Cecil, who is president of Priorities in the United States – a group that supports Democrats in their election – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views about who they should believe in the testimony statements made by Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new reasoning from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in the Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they believed in Kavanaugh in full certainty or in principle.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either deliberately or totally wrong in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the invitation from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the charges made by Ford and at least one other, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's court last week that Kavanaugh was perfectly concerned with her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the guest-named showed her his sexes for a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The Internet Founder plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The Internet Founder, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee was shocked that the plan with Inrupt is "worldly sovereign".
"We'll have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology, so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique in the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can obtain the specific information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s managing director, John Bruce, is to collect resources, processes and ability to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the available tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they're going to change it completely, so that all their business models are suddenly overloaded."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a medium recording on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called network neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the director and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honourable recipients of the Victoria Corps from World War I were arrested
The only priest of the English church who won the Victoria Corps by fighting during World War I will be celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wan came to the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack by Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
But he was killed four days later by a spy and never knew he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, at least one of his two children was discovered at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his children, said that it was “unbelievably symbolic” that the stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather’s orderly business.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick train and under severe protection from machinery and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people with the "greatest man's mod" before he alone attacked a artillery and damaged three cannons.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German skirmish on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his best father's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me jealous."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a crown after the parade, which was announced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the support of all these people underlines the true contradiction."
MMA fans got up all night to see Bellator 206, but got instead of Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the stard Bellator 206 and then you're refused to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald made themselves ready to meet each other, the sights in England were surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were uncompromising, after they had kept awake early in the morning for just this fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a child tag film as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, President of Bellator's senior office when he was asked about the issue.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's managing director, Scott Cooker, said that they would work to include English sails in the planning process.
"When you think about the resend, I think we can get it to work," said Coker.
"But the clock is six Sundays over there, and we don't find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when I was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friends.
We tried to repair it, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're having five fights instead of six, which we usually do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minimum value" over sexuality
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says that he felt less valuable than everyone else in his upbringing, for example, his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it wasn't up for him before he came into the larger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he was less likely to win OL after being a parent.
The usual condition on the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken away a few months of illness.
Daley was a guest in Lavernes' first program and said that he felt "lower worth" than everyone else in his upbringing, because "it was not socially accepted to be able to like boys and girls."
He said: "From now on, the feelings of being remembered and feeling differently have been the things that have given me the strength to be happy."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't scare everyone when they learned his sexuality to know.
The double Olympic Bronze Winner has become a highly proficient LGBT opponents and used its participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live openly without negative consequences, and he would give other "hope".
The third world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar’s 20-year-old winner last year, but told him that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it is difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar up and downs, when you go through so much in such a young age – he took his first OL as 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspectives had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about if I'd win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there by that time.
I held his hand when his air strike stopped, and it came up first to me that he was not immortal when he stopped drawing the wind and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 OL and water bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to cover before a home audience at OL. There was nothing that could hurt the feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first selection of songs – Proud of Heather Small – which had been very significant during the recording of OL and still gave him a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bank for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson records on Sunday, when he plays his 47th fight in Ryder Cup, but he's gonna do something about it if it's not gonna be a sad love.
Mickelson, who records for 12 times being involved in the competition, which is abolished every 2 years, was placed at the bank of Captain Jim Furyk, for example the four-day football and four-year-olds.
Instead of being at the center of the events for the United States as usual, the five-year-old widow had to act and exercise in her role in the hope of raising the chicks.
Even not at the top of the career he had the most direct drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the road at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishs wildfires.
And if the trip wasn't quite verbal enough, Mickelson will meet at the ninth battle on Sunday the precise win of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has fought with the novelist Tommy Fleetwood to win all four battles this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single matches start strong, Mickelson's fight can be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprising trust in his roommate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a grip on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great faith in himself."
He's in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these stocks before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd be playing two games.
I assumed he would play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it would be.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldos kills record for most of the games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to measure itself with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 seats and seven abstentions, although Furyk said his presence contributes to something beyond definition.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, white, he can like to get to people, and he's good to have in the bathroom," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He's contributing much more than just the game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that large numbers can quickly disappear
The European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid performance before the last day of Ryder Cups singles can quickly become nervous.
The Danishs started in 1997 in Valderrama, where a portion led by Seven Ballesteros had a break at five points above the Americans, but it was just by being captured before the goal line with a victory of 141⁄2-131/2.
"You are going to remember yourself that we had a fine performance in Valderrama, we had a fine performance in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just got exactly water," says Björn after seeing the 2018-hold win both 5-3 Fridays and yesterday to a total performance at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have a full glass tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it is to try to win the confidence, and that is where our focus is.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Enjoyed over his players' performances on a hard way added Björn: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that counts, and that's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's going well, but when you're out there alone, you're testing all parameters like golf games.
That's what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he's gonna get the best out of himself."
On the other hand, it looks like opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partnership with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has experienced himself converges on the last day, first on the Brooklyn windmill before he died, when Europe made the "Miracles of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had talked to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When the moment has come to a direction, it puts a big pressure on the middle of the games.
We combine our position in relation to it and put the players on the path in the order we feel for. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to try to lead the back seat and stand for Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other European players in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it ensures us all through," said the Björn about his choice of single players.
The new German warship is re-extended
The latest fleet of German fleets would have stood ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war. But the Germans must wait for at least one year for the reason of technical problems and a scalding price, writing local media.
The introduction of the largest ship in the entire new Baden-Wuertemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is due to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a speaker from the military.
The ship would have become part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have affected the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuertmberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, shall replace the old frigates from the Bremen-Class.
If they are aware that they will have a strong cannon, a large selection of anti-air defence missiles and anti-ships missiles, as well as steelth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it would be possible to have the frigates removed from their homes for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which, as it is said, will get Germany to appear as an overfishing power factor – will already be obsolete when they are caught, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125-free created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Bloom & Voss helicopter in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of decisive "software and hardware errors", which made the warship unusable in fighting situations.
Software error was of particular importance when the ships from the Baden-Wuertmberg class were to be managed by a crew of 120 seamen – that is only half of the crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the possibility of future updates.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, including training of the staff, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached a staggering $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates will become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's flagship forces are breaking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running dry for more clear ships."
The Ombudsman said that the problem was growing over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust snowflakes to the secret life of the Flag Museums
New research from a region in Scotland is trying to discover how flagermus uses the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is carried out by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust and follows common flangermus, drewegflagermus, long flangermus and waterflagermus at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
In particular, recording equipment is located in carefully selected locations in the area of recording the activities of the flag museums throughout the season.
Data are also collected from NTS personnel and volunteers using hand-held detectors.
Deeper analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequency of the flanger muscles and show what kind of action they do.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the population are made.
Natural conservation consultants for NTSC Rob Dewar hope that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of sustainable efforts such as the establishment of nests and the best way to preserve forest areas for flangermus and similar species.
The number of flags in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and construction projects that affect the shippers and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can happen to airfields, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
Flagermus is not really blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced eco-calculation technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important ports and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flagermus very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect ships and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated flag-museum reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's flag-museries.
The owner of the area, David Thompson, says that it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here by Thrave we have a very good area for flagermus," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot you don't know about flagermus, so the work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to be done."
He underlines the importance of looking for flagermus before making maintenance tasks on property, since the destruction of a single reason can kill up to 400 girls and young people.
Flagermus is peace, and it is illegal to kill, generate or disrupt them or their ships.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to hand along.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flag mouse, and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the population develops."
Ronaldo rejects rape complaints while lawyers seek German journal
Christian Ronaldo has called him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to appeal to the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been charged with the rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called Reuters "an inexhaustible publication of suspects of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in a class corresponding to the charge, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other on a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly took back to the player's room, where he was to rape her anyway, according to the report in the town of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "the one percent".
The paper claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple were having sex, but that they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took the photograph of her injuries at a hospital, but later she went to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fucking for revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now says that she will challenge the agreement because she is still deeply affected by the alleged event.
Ronaldo faced a change from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event would have taken place, and changed in summer to the Italian Grand Club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always regret it" if it lost its status as world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production to the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the United Kingdom comes out of the EU by the end of March," said the managing director of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on trade across borders.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of an outflow without agreement.
The production of Toyotas runs on a tight schedule of time, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and discrepancies.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then the production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa Mays Chequers plans for future negotiations with the EU are "constitutional, so that these considerations are clearly ignored at the border."
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The views of Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint member of the factory, says that his members become more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs are gone, they won't come back."
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trumps meeting with Rosenstein may have been delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the local minister of justice Rod Rosenstein can "keep spending a week more", as the final round of the hostel named Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the specific charges of Robert Mueller on the debtor during his investigation of the Russian electoral mix, links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to the course of the court.
Whether Trump will join the local minister of justice and thus risking Mueller's independence, he has been a soldier in Washington a month.
New York Times earlier this month wrote that Rosenstein considered carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump and the opportunity to appoint the President through paragraph 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But on the last morning, he went to the White House, and the noise went up that he wanted to say.
Instead, we agreed to a Thursday meeting with Trump, who was currently in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "not prefer" to four Rosensteins. But the meeting was delayed to avoid an encounter with the Senate's judicial hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked to meet Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be a week with everything going on in the high school.
But we have to see, and I always like keeping the press up-to-date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
The room Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to the TV journalists' game for the gallery, but added, "I'm not surprised that they're playing in the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President takes more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We have seen the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to give you a chance for it, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trup often comes up with questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-end guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure before the present journalists.
Health Ministers contact EU staff in the Scottish Health Service after Brexit Care
The Ministry of Health has written to the EU level in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to become behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than a half year before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its dedicated public sector.
In his letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on enlargement continue, and it seems to be expected that decisions will be made later this year.
But the British government has also increased their preparation for a Brexit, if any, without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate this effort, every individual worker has done, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from outside and outside the EU come with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care for the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to be.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after major injury
Linebacks from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was operated acutely after having suffered a major damage in the 31-27 day of hearing to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports from Tennessee Mike Organ.
First trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the side line and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oil on the sideline before they placed him on a bar and brought him into further investigation.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombies' operation on the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there is no "no details about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he suffered the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for another year and is running with her first season in Tennessee State after a change from Illinois.
He had five thanks on Saturday before he left the fight, which gives him 18 thanks all over this season.
Foreign buyers are required to pay higher stamp taxes when buying houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are required to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. The extra money, according to the conservative party, will help the homeless.
This trick must demonstrate Corby's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will cover those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to get £120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when they buy properties in Britain for the benefit of the homeless.
The drawing will be considered as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with promises of cheaper dwellings and following them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will cover persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The extra fee imposed above the current stamp fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-house purchase and purchase to rent may reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new farmers in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "swift cities" such as the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal will only be made weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp tax in order to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies to keep their property prices up by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop the allowances on cheap apartments to solve the "sudden housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Corbyn has proposed an eye-opening series of housing reforms, including the control of household prices and the withdrawal of the buyer's ability to place people on the road if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the opportunity to conduct public housing.
May said: "The first year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life would be better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be said that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy housing as for hard workers.
For all too many, the dream of having a home is that it's gone too far, and the uncertainty of sleeping on the street is still too wide."
Jack Ross: "The ultimate goal is to become Scotland's trainer"
The Head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his ultimate goal is at a time to become Scotland's trainer.
The stock of 42 enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country that plays.
"I played a fight with the B-hold, and that's it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always stuck in me.
But the chance would only arise if I were successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors who train Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says that he did not have concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure successfully from, if 'I can get this club back in Premier League.'
Out of the structure and facilities of this club, it is obviously home in Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple task, but I'll probably just see myself as successful here, if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career who traines after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart training.
Then he helped Allao come back after being pushed down in the third best series and transformed St. Mirren from the pressure structure to the title winner of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more adaptable now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was quite a different road," he recalls about the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that training was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I made it nice, served wisely and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekend basis.
There's still some kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't had it comfortable with myself all my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 17.30 p.m., shows research
This summer has increased the performance of England’s pubs, but has set restaurant beds under greater pressure.
The sale of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has gone 4,8% down, shows numbers.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continued Sunday and England's unexpected long VM has meant that July follows June's pattern, where the pubs experienced 2.8% mercenaries, except that the restaurants are now severely affected.
The loss of 1.8% of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the sale of beverages made it clear best and experienced progress corresponding to the return of restaurants.
Pubber with focus on food lay in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It looks like people just want to have something to drink.
On average of pubs and bakeries, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 % per month, while the food dropped by 3.3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the outside of the domestic market, the weather and large social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still fighting, even though a 4.8% drop in sales year after year will cause real harm to the higher costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a hard-pressed posterium."
The total increase in sales total for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, who monitors sales tables for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is over $9 billion, and they are leading in the area.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide for their parents.
Every fifth child – up to 11 years of age – has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers shows research.
A study of 20,000 students in the 4th-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual harassment
20 % of students said they had a "main account" that they could show their parents.
Every five children under the age of 11 creates accounts on the social media that they hide for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from the 4th class reveals violent growth in the "false Insta" account – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual harassment.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they are also private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, so a teenager who encouraged others to "to rape me".
The study carried out by the Digital Avarenes UK and Headmasters' and Head Mistakes' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, of which half agreed to have a private account.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are allowed to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Elidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Governing Board of the Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletes, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who make sports decisions to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilid enjoys great consideration in the Atlantic world in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will be able to benefit from having her in management," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help to develop a direction for sports in Scotland."

It's been hard work, but I'm very fast, I've learned to go back and do agile exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pumps, comparing mothers with dogs, gets mixed reception online
A breast pumping company has shared the views online with a advertising that compares surrounding mothers with dogs that are slaughtered.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic video-inspired advertising to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cosal that's filled with pride, to a song where the blue sounds: "Yes, I paint myself, but you don't see any hell" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's not over here, it's my breasts."
The environment sounds like, "pump it out, pump it out, feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, paint my baby."
But the advertising that has been published on the company's Facebook page has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of "the horrors" at the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use dogs to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.

Another wrote: "It's understandable enough traumatizing for both mother and child.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "Sit down an insensitive advertising."
A woman admitted that she seemed to be singing was "unbelievable mother."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still refused, I'd have one.
Aming made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is kind of funny, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertising directed against mothers who pump milk (often on their workplace or on toilets) and feels like 'köer'.
It is not a advertising that rose or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women discover that they've been dancing with the discreet pumps in their buses.
The concept behind the advertising is based on the fact that many women there are saying that they feel like dogs.
The pump from Elvie is completely soundless, has no pipe or snakes and fits the disk in an amme-bwe, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while the pumps.
Ana Balarin, who is a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a harsh and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between common mothers and milk cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we demonstrated in a consistent and understandable way the freedom that the new pump could give."
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Martha Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred children of migrants in secret moved to tentacles at the Texas border
The number of abandoned migrant children has been exploded, even though the number of border guards has not changed. This is partly due to a stronger rhetoric and the corrupt laws of the Trump administration, which make it harder to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to be in the country by standing up and taking up against a child.
The risk of sending home increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior employee at the Immigration and Customs Force, witnessed to the Congress and said that they had held several persons seeking to sponsor innocent minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had clean criminal certificates.
"At least 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' homes are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing the people," said Albence.
In an attempt to address children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within a month after their detention.
Many use video calls instead of themselves to meet up and talk about their case for legal residence to an immigration court.
Those who are condemned unjustly to stay are deported quickly.
The longer the children become cautious, the higher the likelihood that they will suffer from fear or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or pilots, will be heard from auxiliary workers and reports from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on the suffering of a child.
They added that moving to a town without mental preparation or opportunity to say good - bye to friends can bring up dreams that many already struggle with.
Syria informs the US, French and Turkish 'response forces' that they should move immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice Prime Minister, said that the state of the foreign forces is illegal and subject to counter-terrorism, and they will "keep meeting with similar means."
"They shall return immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem stressed that the war against terror " close to over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been displaced since 2011 and millions have fled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all the Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "legal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily training and counseling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" to "spread unreasonably fear", which had the refugees to be removed.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these shipments," he said.
"They're policymaking what would be a purely humanitarian cause."
The United States and the EU have warned that aid will not be made available to rebuild the country prior to a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major opposition control zone in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
On the basis of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, the Syrian forces supported by Russia avoided a major attack on the province of which three million live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clearer deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions would follow Jihadists from the Nusrafront, an explosive group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
The United Nations dispatch Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to call on the new Committee's first meetings to sign a post-war constitution for Syria and the road to a election.
Moualem has provided conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and has said that the work of the panel should be limited to "examine the legislation in the current Constitution", and warned against mixing.
That's why Trump wins another presidential period.
From the logic, Trump is generally re-elected in 2020, unless the rule of law and the scandals end his presidential period before the time when many liberals hope to win.
In what is undoubtedly going to be the most dramatic conclusion of a presidential period ever!
Currently, there are no signs of segregation.
Since 2014, the number of certs in the best sent period has been nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million sails in the best sent time compared to 1.7 million sails four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most sails up to 3.5 million on evenings with big news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC drama Designed Survivor about a leader of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack destroys the convention building.
Nell Scowell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The chauffeur told her he wanted to vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Before he gets me to laugh,' said Scowell.
The cassette has a maintenance value.
But contrary to all other TV programs, the stories from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing channel is only the most privileged of all.
And yet it's more than being informed of citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's extracircuit leather jacket to $15,000 ("cooked with hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' living descriptions of Trump's anatomism.
Anyway, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump-showet's rotating crew and daily surprises (scanters with N.F.L., rose to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you're missing a section, you're off.
When I got in Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC until he got CNN.
He could not go on his own; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Court of Justice, and the future of the Supreme Court would be decided.
"I remember when we made all these shows before the time, and people said, 'It's the beginning of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums of roads leading to the close Middle East elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17 district receives large sums of money, as a result of a comparison of two "Congressional Districts" fighting two members of the Congress on the same seat.
This newly surrounded urban district in Pittsburgh creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who has been sitting in another special election last year.
Lamb stands against another last member of the Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now represented in the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very close to the new 17.
The courts were re-confirmed, after the Pennsylvania Summit in January, that the old district was legally established in the favor of the Republicans.
The fight on the new 17th district has begun a fight on economic resources between the large parties' committees, the Democrats' Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a high-watching election in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The sitting has been on the hands of the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has been in the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
USA considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China, but refused
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with a few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners sent Trump's management service out.
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Foreign Ministry's speechwoman in a previous month's release.
But it was only El Salvador, which was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include compensation for financial aid and restrictions on domestic aid, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials issued a summit on security and economic development, which would have continued the last year's meeting, which was deemed to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, topmed people made it clear that they wanted to have the conference to take place anyway, and thus lost their minds on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is going to talk to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal on the importance of the American meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new demands or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to discuss the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an incomprehensible analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke from a condition of anonymousity.
History
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to research, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
After saying this, Mueller will also correct his research on the question of whether Trump's campaign had secretly cooperated with Russia on the campaign.
If the Congress were to come into new hands, Trump would probably be held responsible while he was preparing to meet the voters again and in time, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump is finally inevitable – and the same applies to his opponents in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officials were ready to join a coup against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the checkmans in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed.
It is about such points of view that the axis of history runs, and the independent march of democracy to and from.
In the United States, there are now too many of these turning points.
What should we do if Trump is threatening the man who decides the future for Muellers research, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since the current newspaper could announce that he had proposed to make secret recordings of the President and to attach his right to the oath.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is accurate.
"How do we react if the newly requested research by the F.B.I.'s Brett Kavanaugh is set up or not implemented properly – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court in spite of credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote on the midway committee for a convention that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I think we can do it.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime itself, who once owned my ambassador's country.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to put up with the flagship table.
How can I be other than optimistic with that in the bag?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers are taking on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive uncompromising result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have a victory against the Austrians to come forward from the Group G of Europe League.
A knifeed middleman, Graham Dorrans, prevented having sex before the 2nd fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good hold," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the faith that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the stick home, but everything was quite a good result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and was the best.
On Thursday, another big European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be hard because they have a good outcome in the final battle, but with the public behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but the vote is good now.
The hold is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can run now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, there were only a few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said that they discussed the costs of long-term work with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the United Nations Life Insurance Company.
That's what you're going to do.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t have time to tell them about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive management. These options can be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term employment can be financed, among other things, by means of traditional long-term insurance, life insurance with cash or self-insurance with your own means – as long as you have the economy.
Get the legal documents sorted out: take the legal battles to the end.
Get a full-time job so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and medical personnel comply with your wishes, if you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider, too, a full economic power.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make economic decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Suppose one of your elderly parents needs medical help and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It is not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
A man shot several times with air raids in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air raid on his way home from a trip to town.
The sacrifice was in the 1940s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, in the middle and hand.
The official describes the shooting, which took place about 02.30, as "fully random."
The victim didn't see the owner.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communications routes are out of play, emergency aid workers have not been able to receive information from the Dodhea accountant, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dodhra, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is in the heart of a small bug on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated a 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dodhea is a county that extends over more than 300 km of coastal line on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main players in the Central Sulawesian economy, particularly in the coastal area of Dodrea.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly located in Morovali, which is the coast opposite of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhra have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred homes in Dodrea.
In 1996, Dondria was again struck by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called volcano in the Pacific and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean Coast, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of mighty earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's nearest population island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying thousands of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya rain forest in Aceh and spread destruction and panic, as the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not released this time, but more than 100 were killed by the combined buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake struck Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's oldest son intended for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Vasilla, Alaska was arrested for suspected domestic violence, preventing the notification of domestic violence and in order to oppose detention, according to the report sent by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is a commodity prisoner in the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility with a loan of $500 without security, KTUU reports.
He was appointed for the court hearing day, where he declared himself "very innocent," reports the network.
Palin is targeted for three Class A violations, which can lead to a prison disaster up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a Class B infringement, which can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been targeted for violations of law.
In December 2017 he was charged with his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the crash.
The case is currently under treatment at the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was targeted at violence in the home to prevent the notification of a violent crime in the home and the possession of weapons in the affected state of the event.
His girlfriend blamed him for giving her a shot in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary groups after explaining his son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people have arrived, after an earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi struck.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed several hundred homes.
The area is without electricity and communication, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck south of the center of Sulawesi, which is north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake strikes.
More than a hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get a terrorist in NYC to condemn the rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to prosecute the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was finally punished for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov used a rental car from the building market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclers who arrived on the road were killed.
On the basis of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov “probably” killed the eight victims and “probably” causing serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intentional death penalty in the southern part of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these claims.
Several weeks after the attack, a government juror was able to present Saipov for a 22-point hearing, including eight charges of murder in connection with gang activities, which are typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "abstaining planning and preparation", the prosecutors said and described Saipov's execution as "unclean, abusive and debased."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, physical damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," states the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade ago that New York's southern district last reported a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was subsequently pronounced in a state case in New York in 1953, and then the marriage was executed by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg after being sentenced for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg parquet was held in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov originated from Uzbekistan and published according to the legal documents no sign of the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he had done well with his actions.
According to the complainant, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to take the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be attached to his hospital room, told the officials.
He's been guilty of the 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "of course were shocked" at the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept an arrest and life imprisonment without the possibility of redemption will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenses had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's flock" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be able to "mark pressure" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The numerous conservative MEPs, Peter Bonne, said to the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would have "be out now", if Farage had been Brexit negotiators.
May's challenge to create a collection in the deeply split party is stressed by conservative retainers participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track under attack by both Brexits, Residents and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite her return, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and therefore force the Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between her package or "kaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he wanted to shoot the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we're going to shoot Chequers."
On the basis of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world war to be inferior to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied that the public's position would have changed since the vote in 2016: "The British people would have changed their minds and would like to be in the EU is completely wrong."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopulated in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopulated in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Kill the Chequers now, and start listening.'
As a tip note to May, she added: "The Prime Minister keeps their job when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail to take the decision from the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They want to hire Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we don't let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must ensure that the political class, which is on the verge of defeating Brexit, can mark the press.
"We mobilize the people here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we do not stop before we become independent, self-government and glory of the United Kingdom."
Imens marked staying through Birmingham before a totimas took over the town.
Spred activists competed with Conservative Mod Brexit runners after the group was formed this weekend.
Working colleague Lord Adonis did before the meeting with security problems with the conservative party apps.
"It is people who claim to have control of IT systems and technology for Canada, border controls, free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's totally green.
There is nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's "surprisingly overhauling" to put up with the presidential committee
Member of the House of Representatives, Senator Elizabeth Warren, "oversightedly to stand up to the presidential committee" after the midway committee in November.
According to Boston Globe, the democracy of Massachusetts spoke about its future during a meeting in Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will try to re-enact the Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired at the 2016 Tromps Massachusetts campaign.
You've been speculating if she wanted to challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the council, since Trump took over the bid.
One participant asked her if she was planning to join the presidential committee.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Maintenance in case of schizophrenia on LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting on the Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
On Friday they released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the records.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and killed by the injuries," said police leaders Murphy J. Paul, according to the media 247sports.
Wayde got in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was heard and agreed to be in possession of a gun and to shoot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two-metre high third-year student, who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played in average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per camp.
Russia's big prize: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world champion, after team orders gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role for the course.
From the driver’s position, Bottas received a good start and was close to raising Hamilton completely by defending his position in the first two swings and inviting Vettel to attack his roommate.
Vettel ran in pit as the first one, and stopped Hamilton from fighting traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes's car went into the pit a little later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back before, when Ferrari had to leave the inside of the road after a double defense at the third floor.
Max Verstappen began from the lowest rank and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the course when he refused to move the roof to take Kimi Raikkon's fourth floor.
He had to go to pit on 44th rounds, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Valtteri did it great all week and really was a gentleman when he let me through.
The holder made an amazing piece of work to ensure us both the first and the second place," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump, Senator Diane Feinstein, held an election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not graduated from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the so-called Britt Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the US Senate panel, but said instead that the events in the Senate showed that people were "unresponsible and hostile and unfair".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has been done in the last few days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and rebellious and unjust," he said.
"When you look at opinions and doctors, and then they say "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who made it?
Remember her answer... was that you who made the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I haven't done anything."
Whoa, just a minute.
No, we didn't do anything," he added in an illustration of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford’s charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was read earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the doctor had come from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's charges, and I haven't cleared her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her resignation was not well received by the president, who said during the hearing day: "I tell you it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In the President's continued defence of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual assault by three women, Trup proposed that the Democrats use their own charges.
"They do not defend any means in their efforts to withdraw power.
You can see the cruelty, the hostilitys, they are equal to who they are to blame for getting power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars mod Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did well again after the day of peace, Elite League battle against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return battle in Dundee in Saturday.
Giants quickly came forward with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compared on the way home before Dwyer brought Giants back.
Francois Bouchard compared to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more targets.
It was the third post of the season, Elite League, for Adam Keef's holding, which came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in the war of peace in Belfast.
It was the fourth session of the season between the sides where Giants went out as masters in the three previous battles.
Dwyer released in four minutes at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant, when Beauvilleer doubled the delivery four minutes later.
In a first period of traffic, Sullivan brought home the back of the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownies' equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Ginants came forward at first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The housekeeper regrouped, and Bouchard compared again with a great goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second time in the fight, and he assured the winner of his fifth goal by half through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five battles, is home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Aeroplanes die to ensure that hundreds of passengers avoid earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia was completely captured after he died to ensure that a flight with several hundred passengers safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday, the Sulawesi island struck and dissolved a tsunami.
The area is still under siege, and many are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agungs fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the weak control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was returned to his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, held on the start-up train, came safely into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was working together.
He died in the hospital later.
Talsman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said according to the Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan, which would bring him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him in the morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We're sundial," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster response reports that there is limited access to the cities of Dodrea, Sigi and Boutong.
"Death is expected to rise, because there are still many in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which includes a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial flights fly emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusumuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more equality.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the shops are packed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cors is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are going to do.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work around the day to perform all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air Niugini Airport in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the flight in the valley
The airline behind the plane, which led down the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that a man is missing, even though he had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the approaching plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that the afternoon was unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that it had cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Locals were involved in saving the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water under landing in the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The officers said on Friday that seven people were in the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers were in the hospital until Saturday, and that they were all in a stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the management and the exact order of events.
The U.S. and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the valley before the landing route.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was flying across the country.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed in very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go to life to get to the emergency exits on the floating plane.
He said that the crew was panicking and screaming and that he had received a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailers who worked to renovate a horse in the vicinity also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to catch people in the country before the plane fell about 30 feet [30 m] deep.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyticals determine the time line for the night when a woman was burned alive
The complainant concluded his evidence on the hearing of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts in the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as experts in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecoms to combine the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claim, writes The Clarion Ledge.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed he and his friend Michael Sanford visited the Sanford police.
Sanford sat in the witness hospital on Saturday and told him he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck last night, Sanford said he said, "Hey, because my car was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they only knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that at a time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence is intended to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hippop?
A hippoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by providing their music with positive messages.
The High Broad from Bristol believes that the hipop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hippop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Even a black person?!
Children's Picture in New York seeking a couple after dating with "racist" SMS
A child girl in New York seeks a couple of discriminatory boyfriends after having sent a text message to an error from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple claimed that they were racist, but compared the search to "repression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is mother to two, expressed his curiosity about finding out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first day of work in 2016.
"NIEEEEEEJ, NOT ONE AND SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, she threw off the "floating" Plastic-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former childhoods, such as African-American, had been bad for her work, and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home to a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice seeks compensation for the fire and compensation for $350 per day for the six months she would have settled with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't be allowed to do this," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The Parthe has defended herself that they are not racist, and that Maurice's fear was justified, because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after having insulted her.
"My wife had come to send her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you hand your children over to someone you had been unnecessary for, even though it was a mistake?
This child of a bitch?
It's very honest."
Plasco compared the search target to "repression", and that his wife had been born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really looking for someone like that?
It is not particularly friendly," the investment consultant added.
Although the case is still under way, the Court of Human Rights has already deplored the debate on social media and condemned their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's delegation was afraid that readers could not relate to a voice bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was written for release, said about the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the first to read it before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC, before being inspired to write the book of children about a small puzzle, would have been optimistic, even though his history had been rejected, and that the 60th year for the publication of the books was "biter cut" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all intelligence was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't want to talk," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your reward.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity in that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Said color to dying daughters over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"After calling with equal space to say that it was really bad and that she didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart in motion gradually lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to take me together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew that," she said.
"I shook my head, and the tears began to run.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Surgeoning Women Trying to Stop Self-Smokers
Two women who have lost their lives in suicide attempt to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a map on a Walisian bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed and 18, when he started killing himself.
"I don't want any parents to experience the sadness I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by all.
People said his smiling shook the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he had really fucked up.
In 2014, it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid of spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people there's someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you need to talk to anyone."
Sharon Davis' many-year-old friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about his being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas he began to change.
He was really far down on Christmas, and when the children opened their gifts, he never had any contact with them."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to come through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
We've seen each other.
But we all have to go on and fight together."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear while the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked about – a limited time-limited study with limited scope – we might get some agreement," Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "fall from the back" in the middle of the determined party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI conducted their investigation?
Their retention is due to the intention.
The midway elections are only five weeks away on 6 November, and if the Republicans, who are expected to be poor, will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they wish to choose to the highest courthouse in the country.
George W. Bush has called the senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thus met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote on the afternoon, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice-President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the highest position.
Number of North Korean 'flanders' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean kidnappers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-Seug referred to data from the Ministry of Collection of South Korea and said there were 1.127 missing last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human mussels were contributing to the changing figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In the long run, most refugees from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most refugees across China, who have the longest border crossing to North Korea, and who are easier to cross than the highly forced demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China believes that refugees are illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced to leave their homes.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still in war – has been significantly improved over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to discuss the beach negotiations on nuclear weapons.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against an atomic-free Korea at a global level.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong-ho gave US sanctions on the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will put our own hands down," Ri said in a talk to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh for "hysterical" and says he's unaccompanied to the height.
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, for "histerical" and said that his temperature was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comment came in an interview on Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, she would have been called hysterically," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's trial on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the guilt that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and when he spoke about his family and years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him "big and coordinated against" organized by the left-wing wave, which was angry that Hillary Clinton did not water the president's post in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the seat because it showed that he was President of the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the opinions and the way he followed Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi, except when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a state law, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get more in the House of Representatives.
"I mean, if he doesn't speak the truth about Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but specifically in the court he's sitting now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently sits as a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or abortion Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer the question of whether he would make certain previous high school decisions.
"It doesn't have to happen that a hysterical, privileged person should fight a job as judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just nice'," said Pelosi.
And women need to use it.
It's a fair outcome, a couple of months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got a lot of feedback from a woman who was the boss who said that she too cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: "You may think I'm sorry about it because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just got to know.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are in the background and are misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of one of my first jobs in an office with a head of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss who I had always been a little scared of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're racist.
They'll think you're sorry about it, and they'll be glad they got your back."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to have a business on a boat named Monkey Business and took himself as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the point that she could do as well as herself as the presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a particularly thought decision," she said with surprise to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run, and they definitely did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the seven o'clocks."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was back with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The sword was lost before.
She found that some of her support, which gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they believe I'll get rid of it?" she thought.
When she said that she would not stop, she was overcome by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to travel money and get out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a bullet in her neck.
"I could believe I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press responded to her.
"I should have thought I was sponsored by Kleineex.
I remember thinking what was going to be written on my grave?
"She's crying"?
This way the US-China trade war can be a blessing to Beijing
The openings of the US-China trade war were high, and, even though the war far from over, the gap between the countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump rejected the first warning grant earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest scaling this week, with new customs duties affecting goods of a value of $200 billion, applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has committed each time, at the latest by placing customs duties at 5-10 % on US goods for $60 billion.
China has answered to follow the United States all the way, and probably the world's closest economy does not give at the same time.
If it gets Washington to withdraw his demands, it means that they give up, but for the President of China, Xi Jinping will be too hard to bend for the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its shorts correctly, the US pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a grave for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, a research worker focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready to receive refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready for the return of refugees and asks for help to build the country that has been destroyed by it for more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and certainly thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government has continued to control the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore normal conditions.
All conditions are now in place to enable refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions imposed on their daily days and bread of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have been fled from the country since 2011, where the war started.
More than six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government wanted to help rebuild the mountainous country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that were involved in supporting the uprising.
Europe guarantees Ryder Cup-Seir in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and won the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National without Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was back in trust when Captain Thomas Björn's position reached the 14.5 points, which required killing the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it very hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the sea on a couple of 3 to 16 holes, which made him lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari worked well in all rounds and became 1 out of all 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjörn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world list, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the bagagen, Spain Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to have the trust back.
It is a stand-alone act, and I am glad that I could help," said an emotional lady Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the fax to his countryman John Ram, who fell down the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single-match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of having killed Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history on 13-21-3.
It is a spy statistics for one of the best golf players ever who has won 14 great titles, just passed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems with finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his shocking observation: "I am proud of the good people, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a fight.
We lost.
The hate for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we will proceed.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to make it easy on your hat.
We were wounded."
