The members of the Gales Assembly are concerned about "who take them for Moniques"
Controversy between some of the members of the Assembly, currently known as AM, on the suggestion that they should change the name by MWP (Member of the Gales Parliament).
The debate was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid of being reticulating.
A member of the Laborist Party said his group was worried that the new name "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For those who didn't know Gales, "twp" means "bad" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party showed that the group set "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A French conservator said his group kept an open mind about the change of name, but he pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in Gales is pronounced similar to the English word "u" in Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the reading to introduce the amendments to the name, said: "Of course, the final decision on any description of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Law of the Gales Government of 2017 gave the Galese Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals, which showed great support for the name of the Gales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of AM, the committee preferred Members of Parliament Galés or the WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for President Elin Jones, which is expected to deliver the bill on changes in weeks.
The Law on Reform will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, such as the rules of amm capacity and the design of the Committee's system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on how they should be called when they debate the reading.
Macedons come to the Urns by reference to change the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday if the name of their country is changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has been with neighboring Greece for decades, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim from its territory and is repeatedly opposed to its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the change in name, said he would make a case against the vote.
However, the rapporteur's advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change in name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep quiet while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders to whom I spoke said there was a bar and a church in each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or the other."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people are socializing in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the rooms of being out of the bars where people usually go."
As for the churches, I'm afraid the money for the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders wait, and "before or after they return where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by buildings of apartments with communities of owners of the same type of people who would not help the neighborhoods continue to be shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation near the building was built.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by the viceroy John Howard Johnson, who led a boyot in the 125th street tents, a Harlem business street that was opposed to contracting and climbing to black people.
A fire in 1939 left the very damaged building, but as Father Johnson's fries made plans to rebuild it, they carried the carillion.
The King David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the champion as "the fields of the poor."
The expert who touched the wheel in julio called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the world's first carillion played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who changed it by the largest carillion of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one cared for his place in St. Martin.
Those who are taking care of St. Martin during the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish union, the body that governs the parish and which is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing its concern that this last "prepares to affect the costs" to the assembly, although it did not participate in the contracting of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some fries complained of lack of transparency by diocese.
A tiger will kill a boy while fishing fish in California
The police reported that a tyburon attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing submarine fishing in the search for lions in California on the first day of this cruise.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel brought him to the KSWB-TV in San Diego, which took about half an hour to walk with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with his calls, when he was born with a group of people to help get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an emotion to hunt a wolf, but that soon he realized that he was crying "I was hurt!
They've worked for me!'
Hammel said he was upset when the boy got there.
"I invite everyone out of the water: 'There's a tiger in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transferred to a helicopter to the child’s Rady hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted to critical state.
The type of tyburon responsible for the attack is unknown.
Soccer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they would divide a tiger in the area a few weeks ago, but that they would determine that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami's, to Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 tyburon species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plan to enter the UK beauty market
Sansbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of the big warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable entry into the United Kingdom's beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow while sales in fashion and products to feed are falling, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents across the country, and then the others will be successful next year.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the stalls that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and cigarette products.
Sainsbury's said he would double his offer of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also launching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more required by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online purchases and a change that translates into buying small quantities of food daily in small stores involve that supermarkets have to do more to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that establishments will always look more like commercial centers, as supermarkets try to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's already introduced points of sale of Argos and Habitat in hundreds of tents, since he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to modernise its pharmaceutical and beauty departments was a failure.
Sansbury's initiative was launched with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the association came to its end after a debate on how to share the pharmaceutical revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sells his pharmaceutical business formed by 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
He commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Sansbury's business, said: "We transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in particularly trained personnel that can be found to seek advice.
Our range of products is designed to adapt to all the needs and attractive and practical locations that mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "freak" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, went "frequency" after the television presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his house clothes and Truly accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones snucking chips to withdraw from his life-style brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "frequency" when the gold girl on television admitted during a quiet meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that she had no time to dedicate her to the brand of home and accessories, Truly.
The business came to be compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, went to Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones took a plane to Great Britain and headed to one of his vacation residences.
One source said: "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It would be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left atoms to all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a full store of goods in Marlow's offices to sell."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products coming from the kitchens and candles and clothing and textiles to feed it, and that it could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples go together for vacations and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will convert to the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a representative in the ITV program to Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night that "We shouldn't comment on their business affairs."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He pointed out the criticisms he would receive from the media by making a comment that some would consider "some of the president's own" and by being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump pay so much?
Trump said by putting his voice on the "television representative".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his first meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization were terminated.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "responsive answer" by the United States of America to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his mitin speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"Let's go to war with North Korea.
They'd have killed millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending the missile tests, helping free hostages and making the rest of the US soldiers home.
And he defended his insulating strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people on top here," said Trump signaling to the crowd that had just gone ahead.
A symbi and a tsunami destroy an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national disaster had been declared, which is an essential condition for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they left it very clear that they did not ask for international assistance, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbong.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still not clear whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, Member of the National Disaster Management Agency, made sure that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to their assistance.
Given the earthquakes that continue to afflict Indonesia, the country is very badly prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although refuges for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other coasts.
Although a warning is being issued, the absence of a tsunami alarm in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital boat that was raised in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake will travel to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's electoral campaign turned around the improvement of the damaged infrastructures in Indonesia, and provided money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds at the end of the next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their camps because of the confrontations in the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, using masks, bows and arrows and other handguns.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of the empathe front to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the First League before Chelsea with a gol in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri, still about 27 metres from Chelsea's port with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the balloon with the left leg before he fired a shot at the second floor.
The balloon crossed the area as it moved towards the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling on a Arrizabalaga cap that jumped into the air and entering the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball in front of the best possible, so I tried to win the best possible time," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and from a touch without thinking too much and I just disappeared."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marked at 25.
The front of the Azuis passed the talent ball to Matthew Kovacic in that game, before turning close to the middle of the change and going into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the camp.
He made a beautiful passage in depth leading Hazard towards the area.
Hazard exceeded the defense and ended up in the second peace marking with a shot with the bitch that Alison Becker wasn't able to stop.
Liverpool confronts Naples in the season of the Champions League's groups on Wednesday 3 afternoon at the San Paolo Stadium of Naples, Italy.

The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and in the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, reports the National Disaster Management Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped between the walls of the buildings that came down with a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press release, the voice of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman died being arrested.
He opened a murder investigation after he found the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds in John Street, and stopped a 32-year-old suspect of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something about a step forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I would like to make a call to contact anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I'd also like to ask anyone, especially the taxis, to capture anything with the camera of the manned camera that is in contact with us, because they could have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a neighbor of Birkenhead and found it within a property.
This evening, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police are in the process of informing the most accessible family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police reported that they didn't allow anyone to come and get out of the building.
The man left no words when he discovered what happened.
The residents just knew they couldn't get in again within hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman crying in the scene.
Not to say 'it's horrible'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vehicles inside the cordon with another train just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the block of apartments.
Anyone who has information, you ask him to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, which calls to 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously on the phone number 0800 555 111 by quoting the 247 log of 30 September.
The statute of Cromwell of Parliament became the last monument affected by the struggle for "re-rewrite the history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for its destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its fanatic and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disarm" and to "try to re-write the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Westminster Palace.
The icononclastia of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe they would have sacrificed to Cromwell mistakenly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the history of a figure that many consider is still worth honour.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as Parliament's advocate of external pressure, in this case, of course, was the monarchy.
Whether that is or not a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the middle conflict of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a side of the division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and celebration."
A killer pig snacks a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in the southwestern China market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the appellant, "Yuan," was found dead with a cut-out and blood-covered close to a cut in the Liupanshui market, in Guizhou province.
A porcupine cook prepares to put the vaccines to pigs in a castle on 30 and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He seemed to travel with his cousin the Wednesdays from nearby Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him the other suitable cut.
He said there was a big nose with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilograms, attacked the farmer to kill him.
"My cousin had his legs enchanted and unsnapped," said the first, appeal "Wu," to the Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. of the wires to give him food to his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent anyone else from attacking, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, there will already be cases of dogs that attack people earlier.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pack of nearly 300 pounds [300 kg] approached a Galilean farmer against the tractor until he reached his wife and threatened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs don't pretend to be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "smoker.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa prison will bring strong and generalised rain to the southwestern United States.
The projections indicate that the Rosa hole is weakened as it passes the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and to the south of the United States during the next days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, East time, Rosa was a category 1 oven with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa reaches the low California peninsula the moon as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical humidity to the north, which will penetrate the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico or the moon.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with valgade will create abundant and generalised rain in the southwestern next few days.
At the local level, precipitations between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, floods of forests and the possibility of land degradation in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-west, it expects 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially on much of Arizona.
Possibilities of repeated floods with deterioration due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise you to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rain could form cannons that could be converted into floating rivers, and electric storms will bring local wind and dust.
The valgade will bring locally strong rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total precipitations could reach more than 12 l/m2, which could at once cause flow of smaller and narrow roads.
These would be the first rain in the cold station in the region.
Tropical scattered quives will begin reaching Arizona at the last hours of the Sunday and the first of the moon, before the rain is extended at the end of the moon and Tuesday.
The abundant Chuvia will come to Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will be a witness to large temperature oscillations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropicals will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves important temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of dramatic differences in temperature in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to re-appear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm start will be expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees south of the north-east.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows high probability of temperatures higher than average to the west of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial in Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the dear witnesses to the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual aggression in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last hour of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Senator Jeff Flake, to enable the FBI to carry out a week of work.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that it's a hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh made it to her while she was drunk and that she tried to get her clothes off at a party in the institute.
In a loving witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
Nielsen reported the coming of more than 20.4 million people who would have seen it.
The company reported the media audits in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other lines that re-transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble measuring people who come from offices.
To make an idea, it's a similar hearing to a final football or Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest continued.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday on TV.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement indicating that Kavanaugh would vote in favour of it, it was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and supported by demonstrators when he tried to enter a road elevator at the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
It remained with the look down for several minutes while it was retraced, televisiond directly at the CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office had made a record of Blake, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say in the committee's hearing.
All television and cable lines were transmitted directly after the Judicial Committee had to vote to make the appointment of Kavanaugh before the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Blake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the one named next week, which was a minority of Democrats.
Blake was partly convinced by the conversations held with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Blake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first British minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused who criticized his plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Great Britain and to undermine national interest.
First Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, September 29, 2018.
Another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should recoup the tariffs on the other side was " utterly absurd".
Wade Sims murdered: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect to carry out the shootings that ended the life of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old ball player from the LSU (University of Louisiana).
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-grad murder charge.
The officers released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims would lose the gates during the fight.
The police recovered the scene's gloves and confirmed that they contain Simpson's DNA, according to CBS, WAFB's affiliated channel.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the gunman who killed Wade.
The defense reported that a US$ 350,000 loan had been launched.
The East Baton Rouge parish office issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the unit of folitics of the state police in Louisiana, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police are the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of the local order for their "justice and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01-year-old grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played the ball player for the LSU.
Its average of the past period was 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
Tomorrow morning, LSU's ballistic instructor, Will Wade, declared that the team was "cut" and "encouraged" by Wade's speech.
"This is what worries us all the time," said Wade.
Red Volcano on Mexico City
The ashes that rocked the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after their crater activity was detected and 183 gas and gas emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several strangers and horrors.
The images of the social networks showed fine white hats in the parabires of Mexico City's bars like Xochimilco.
The geophysics observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located at 72 kilometres south of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake destroyed the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Fact between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the anti-disturbing police protesters were arrested and thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer vote on the Catalan sect.
A group of masked proseparatists containing anti-police anti-disturbies lead eggs and paint in which they created dark cloud clouds in the streets that tend to be attached to tourists.
There were also colds later that same day with the police, who used the bags to contain the cure.
For several hours, groups of self-dependentists who sang "I'm not forgetting nor sorry" were faced with the demonstrators who shouted "Living life in Spain".
Forty people had to be treated for mild injuries received in the protest, according to local press.
The tension continues to grow in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted for independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the section voted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the electoral fairs throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Prodependent groups camped all night in the spring to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration was also produced but became required to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independent demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of getting Cataluna into independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I came to my parents to cry happy to be able to vote, but now we're tired," he commented.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, although he decided, in the regional elections of last December, this year the pro-independent Catholic parties fought to keep the momentum, with many of their most well-known leaders in a self-imposed exile or held in the waiting for trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by both gang politicians.
"Every time there's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate to the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: They arrest a man after a car is set against a house

The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent or shaves around 19:30 (in the summer hour in Great Britain).
The police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the redirect and the building in which the affected parts were.
It's also possible to shoot a ride against the car at some point.
Menga's gol gives Livingston the victory 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston finished in victory
Livingston's upstairs surprised Rangers by bringing Steven Gerard to his second defeat in 18 parties as Ibrox's club instructor.
Dolly Menga's goal was to make Gary Holt's team up a level after the Hibernian, second position.
Gerard's team continues without smoking out of the house this year in Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, who separates them eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Quick Vienna in Europe League the wolves.
Namentres, Livingston continues to be involved in the division by six consecutive parties; the principal instructor, Holt, has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston lets you escape opportunities from weak visitors
Holt's team had to make a lot of progress before the moment they marked, because with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his cross-fire did not cross the border of the port; then Alan Lithgow's shot went out excited by Craig Halkett's head from the other side of the port.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put the visitors at risk in the ball stop.
And that's how the decisive wave arrived.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a shot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson united their efforts to fix Menga, which touched the balloon and marked from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated the possession but met with an impenetrable defense that prevented him from working very hard on the Liam Kelly guard.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Ranger's guard, Allan McGregor stopped with a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow threw the ball out another game at Livingston's stopped balloon.
Many crossings in the Livingston area have been developed that were constantly inspected, while two criminal requests were rejected: one by hand and one by Halkett's entry to Glenn Middleton's substitute.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Lasadair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
An action and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
The unanimity, they were excellent and continue to overcome expectations in their rising trajectory.
Your game style and players have only changed since you returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt in the way you pushed the team since your arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halket, the captain, led a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give them any breath throughout the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers missed their inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerarrd's order, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
The last move failed. You were only able to enter the host team once. Any warning call to Rangers, which is found in half of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguity in Colombia
On Saturday, September 29, there were tears and blue skies during the meeting of Turkish and German leaders to breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last anniversary of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to establish relations between NATO allies.
Many issues, including human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's access to the EU, have been raised.
Then Erdogan directed the Colonia to open up a new giant mix.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many members of Erdogan arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan (many of the Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The grief of demonstrations reflects the division in front of a visitor called hero by some German Turks and criticised as autocrats by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a fail-distance cycler when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a college where a car was found in London.
The accident took place close to the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a transliterated road from Deptford, in the south of the city, about 10:15 hours (the summer hour in Great Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man spoke in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in an atropel with escape in Childers Street a little over a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police showed that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street blocks and bus stops and they are advised by motorists who avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in an alternative to high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance began at the HMP Long Lardin of Worcestershire around 09:30 hours (in the summer in Great Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "turned" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the disturbances, involving eight prisoners who are contained in a palace.
Officials received attention for mild injuries in their face.
A voice from the prison service said: "It was a personal lack of special training to deal with an ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff had to be subjected to injuries.
We did not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between the churches."
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he knew that the director of the prison centre had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disturbing officials had to go to prison to calm a revolution in which the staff was accommodated with billing balls.
The Rosa Furcán threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely that the beginnings of the next week will occur when the remaining energy of the Rosa fusion passes through the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued warnings of current floods for the moon and March of West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will pass directly on Phoenix tomorrow and arrive at the last hour of the moon with rain.
Phoenix's National Meteorology Service indicated in a publication on Twitter that "only ten tropical cycles will maintain the state of depression or tropical storms in the 320 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread across a 64-mile radius of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with illogical quantities up to 150l/m2 in the Mogollón Bordo de Arizona.
Other areas of the South-East Desert, such as the Central Rochesa and the Gran Conca could reach 25 or 50 litres, with possible total irradiated 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, because the region is very affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain can be beneficial, as the Southeast is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. dry monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drying, the second largest category," reported weather.com.
First, the Rosa farm will touch the ground in the low California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have the force of the hurricane on Sunday morning, with wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north to 19 km per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and thus losing strength.
For this reason it is expected to touch the land in Mexico with tropical storms in the evening or at night of the moon.
It could be very intense in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total precipitations are expected from 75 to 150 l/m2 from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, and can be found with up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico in the form of tropical storms before arriving at Arizona's border the first hour of March as tropical depression and will continue to rise through Arizona and enter south Utah the last night of March.
"The main danger of Rosa or what is left of is the strong precipitation in the Netherlands California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwest of the U.S.", the National Centre of Furacáns reported.
It is hoped that these rainwaters can cause sudden floods and floods in the deserts, and earthquakes in mountainous lands.
Aggression in Midsomer Norton: four arrests by attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white weapons wounds.
The teenager was injured in the Middle East Excelsior Terrace area, the Saturday around 04:00 (in the summer in Great Britain).
It was taken to the hospital, where it remains stable.
According to Somerset police, three boys 17, 18 and 20 years of age were arrested during the night, respectively.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the event's mobile.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh 's Democratic Party' has "difficulty and cholera"
"Voice by Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the missing and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a myth in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "has suffered the amethystity and cholera" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress, where he held a category and emotionally charged Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually abused decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in court on his charge.
The president said on Saturday that that day the "Americans" were witnesses of the brightness, quality and bravery of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our time with an impotuous public service history," he said, pointing to the crowd of admirers in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the Republican results in the half-mandatory elections.
"Five weeks pass for some of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't do it, but really if I do it," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is "to resist and stop."
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh took place before Friday, according to the CNN, a representative of the Republican Party.
The sysism and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to rise
The authorities reported on the Sabbath that at least 384 people were killed, many of them being dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the village of Palu when waves of up to six meters fell on the ground to the luscofus, raising the lives of many and destroying everything on its way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"In the past, when he threatened, the people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they disappeared," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency BNPB in a round of arrests in Yacarta.
"The tsunami didn't just see, dragged cars, tanks, houses, pulled everything I found," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami ran high at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs distributed by the national disaster management agency showed many destroyed tents and buildings, retreats and broken bridges and a water mix.
The Replica continued to dry the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the enormous wind current was around 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "hatious" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, and hotels would come down.
The bodies of some victims were caught under the walls of the damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, a area called Dodhria and which is closer to the center of the sysm.
The communications remained "totally paralyzed and there is no information" of Dongrea, adding Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," he reported to Cruz Vermella in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were on their way to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not having reported the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an affidavit recording shared in social networks, you can listen to a man who is found at the last floor of a building screaming frrenetically by warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In a matter of minutes, water shocks against drinking in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the writing.
The sysmism and tsunami caused an important disappearance that caused the Court of Communications throughout the Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Yacarta and other cities, but refugees continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was opened again but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit Palu's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The balance of the victims of Indonesia's tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that the World Vision staff traveled to the city of Palu, where the employees were saved in refugee shelters from leun in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of total destruction, commented Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of launching assistance in the event of disaster, some complained that they were preventing them from traveling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only flow if the location of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Ariani, a voice from the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves to international aid, but that time has not yet arrived."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of the winter, family and friends of the missing were held in hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that eased the depressive argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they took a kid from a summit.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who took two days under the shoulder with her mother's body to her neck.
Gendon Subandon, trainer of the national team of parapente, taught two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, who completed the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandia added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the parapet field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the dispersion of the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapentist community, he unexpectedly tried to send messages from WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, in the messages only a grey mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Rouban $26,750 while recharged to Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was recharged by a driver in Newport on the Level, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press note, researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying a boxer in the eight complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole him a purse of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identity, contact Newport police by calling number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Rape changed its name to Yes
The Kanye West rapper changed the name for Yes.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be first known as Kanye West."
Some time ago West, 41 years old, was known to the mayor of Ye, who used as title of his eight album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch your new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande with the program, who canceled his assistance for "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'ti', it will say that same year while talking to the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, the only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that we have, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rapists who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year announced that he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, was also appalled by putting and removing the script and using the mauscules.
AMLO undertakes not to use military forces against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, committed to refrain from using the military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against the students is reached.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "it would never be used by the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were getting worse throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the Mexican youth by offering monthly assistance to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted boys to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in I.A.
According to the investor and professional of IA Kai-Fu Lee, used by Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S.A., it should double the amount it invests in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
Comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, even if the U.S. lacks a formal IA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it intends to be number 1 in IA innovation in 2030.
"Doubling the budget for research in IA would be a good start, as the other countries are much more behind the US, and we are looking for the next big advance in IA," said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next IA was made in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese companies of IA: Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the American Othello player with a higher score and later was executive in Microsoft Research from the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic Network of the Advanced Defence Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers tend to have to work hard to get government bags, Lee says.
"China is not taking academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies hired university geniuses to work in IA.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the United States to boost its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The Council of State of China published its plan for the development of artificial intelligence for the new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to persons of academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distributed money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House has announced the formation of the selected artistic information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
In addition to the NSF, you currently invest more than $100 million a year in IA research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered movement for months.
Macedonians vote by referring to the change in the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday by referring to whether they wanted to change their name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and which would block requests for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbours in the north represents a claim from its territory and has seen its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the new name proposed, but nationalists argue that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would end 50 per cent of the minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the paper on this subject was: "Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Defenders of the change of name, including former Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth to pay for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have today voted for the future of the country, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament said that they would achieve the result of the vote and that they would do so definitively.
The change of nine would require a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularity would be recorded at 1 p.m..
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the voters recorded their vote.
"I voted for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
The first Macedonian minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, recorded their vote to the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country that would open the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scenario and placed chairs in front of the tents for whom they would vote.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our high head and not through the service door, Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can join other countries such as China and Russia and enter the Eurasian Union."
First Minister Zaev states that accession to NATO will bring the investment so necessary to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate above 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the requirement.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian television station Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people interviewed were planning to vote on Sunday.
These, 70 percent said he would vote yes.
In order to make the reference valid, the result must be 50 per cent more than one vote.
A failure in the reference would represent the first important attack on the policy of the proocc Western government since it entered into power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Agurero, player of Manchester City, through all the defence of Brighton and finished marking a gol
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took account of the defence of Brighton with 2-0 from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I made it look ridiculously easy to mark the 65-minute gol.
The Argentine front received a passage in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before he went to the open field.
Then Agero was found surrounded by four green shirts.
A defense was needed before crossing several more on the coast of Brighton.
Next, he passed the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to return the balloon to Aguero, which hit the roof of Brighton Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right of the network.
"Agero is going through some problems in the foot," said the city teacher, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about 55 or 60 minutes.
And that was when it happened.
We were lucky to mark it at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Azulcelists the initial advantage in the front of the Premier League.
That gol came in at 29 minutes.
Agariro received the balloon at the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the street on the right side of Leroy Sane.
Sane had several touches before leading Sterling to the opposite position.
The Azulcelists measured the ball in the port before leaving the camp.
The city will meet Hoffenheim in the champions' group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to party to Rockies
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to strengthen another title.
But a competitive Scherzer always expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which will lead to a profit party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the comedian with victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the denver atmosphere with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why don't I want to compete with that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opener on Sunday, but it seems to focus on what Scherzer is doing in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his beginning number 34 would be, made another bulppen session, and probably will launch Sunday on his usual holiday.
The right of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Tremendous and mixed-up in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the outcome in the half-mandial elections.
"We did everything we did in November.
They're missing five weeks for some of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't do it, but really if I do it and that's why I'm going to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "Come to this terrible radical group of Democrats, see what's going on now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, evil, and inequality.
They don't care who harms, above whom they have to pass to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we'll never give it."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And they've seen that in the past four days," he said, qualifying the democracies of "announced, walvad, noxent and liar."
He numbered the Senate's judicial committee, quoting Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received strong applause from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Filter the document?
Mmm. Come on, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party is no longer so open.
It's not tolerant of how they express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, you didn't surprise me too much.
after all, I'm the last of a series of working Members we're not well received, and everything to say is our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because he faced a decision against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, sometimes issues that Jeremy raised with previous leaders.
The notification to the Working Meeting of Nottingham East on Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of the eight years I took as a member of the Committee, the meetings of the Committee on Friday evening were exactly that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and generous" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever begun.
It is always more obvious that the working party does not tolerate different opinions and argue if all opinions are acceptable to the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when colleagues who wanted to share a similar political vision began to expect me to be retraced and adopted positions with which I would never agree, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact of a little like what I say, there's an ambiguity and attacks on social networks by censoring the central policy, saying I shouldn't be at the Laborist party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my peers, because the comments that I've made to myself are used to being political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexual or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the levels of insult have been standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with each movement of "untrust" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrower.
Over the last few years, I have received many advice that urge me to keep my head covered, not to be so frank and that then "it would be all right for me."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 there is still in school, led by the neglect of the government of Thatcher that would literally let down my school, I tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, as well as a local consul as the government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political positions and I do not agree with the current direction of the party.
To those who have promoted the movement of the Friday, the only thing I would tell you is that while the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our firemen, businesses and public services, I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud of services and I promise that no threat or political convention will discourage me from acting in accordance with what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invitation Ayr put in his head
It is possible that the last two attempts will change a little of the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this threat from the Tenent Premier League.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only inside team of ten.
It was finally the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk, that he took the team to victory, and the trainer Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"So far we've tested ourselves in our party and followed invictions, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You have to recognize that Ayr has taken better chances than ours."
The test in the 14 minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put before the Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, awarded for the party by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk about the numbers and Jason Baggot invented a wrong launch.
Climate has increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty before, just in the middle of the time, transforming a single shot, leaving the marker 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Next there was a prolonged pause by the severe injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which left the field in the corridor and, since the beginning, Ayr has made further progress through a test of Stafford McDowell, transformed by Climo.
Captain dde Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose took a chance to have another player with Bruce Colvine's test that didn't consume, at the end of a long period of pressure.
However, the local team returned, and when Sruan Hutchinson received the yellow card for air conditioning when he didn't have the balloon, McPjherson marked a trial from the prison line on the back of the Ayr tower.
Climo marked, as he almost did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in the area of David Armstrong and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the local team's fifth test.
Still Game's protagonist begins a new career in the restoration industry
The Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interprets Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The second announced that the next nine times would be final, and Kierman seems to be planning another life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the Director of Affygorn Limited.
The actor was busy making comments, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "prosperous business of the restaurants" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': inner Bolivia expects the court to take the way to the Pacific
The mariners were looking at a shipyard covered by apparatus in La Paz.
Public buildings go a blue flag.
Ship bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are attached to the slogan: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a coast lost before Chile in a bloody conflict of resources of the 19th century continues to live, just as the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at its most flexible point in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impetus, a spirit of unity and seriousness and of course is waiting for a positive release," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX judgment in giant screens throughout the country with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will declare itself in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of Bolivia from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a Polish battle for the reelection next year, also has a lot in the light of the moon's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia reason, and that it would not change if that happened.
The United Nations agency, with its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to assist Chilean territory, and has stressed that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we have heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", says the Chilean expert at international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been a long time ago.
"The topic of access to the sea takes a long time to be blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' wonderful rhetoric weakened the good will that he had left in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations for a while, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court would have made an unusual decision.
The Bolivian moon will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end into 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also concluded that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be produced unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong, states that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be the point of relaunching the nuclear diplomacy suspended for more than three decades after the summit with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that it is "an utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, there's still an acceptance of the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalised speculation that Pyongyang speaks seriously about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trup summit.
Paris fashion profiles reveal the last line of giant shadows that will soon be in tents.
If you want to increase your collection of shaders or if you want to tap the whole sun, don't search for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the past a series of extravagance accessories for their spring-war 2019 collection that they had dedicated to the public with the most pure style of the Paris Week of fashion.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer, and these designers brought out their most surprising creations.
The main piece of Valentino was an excavated braided shirt with a wide coat, imitating feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were frozen sandwiches, a mago hat and even a peach, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masked colors had the cut lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high costume.
One of the creatures seemed to be a full set of mergulls, with the gloves and the tube, and the other one with a detached tail.
And if it's from the giant fashion, it's lucky.
The fashionable minds predicted that the giants could reach the tents.
The disproportionate shadows come right after the "Bomba", the ball shadow with a depth of less than 60 cm that takes the whole world, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the shadow that is impossible to invasate all social networks has brought to the pass another great creation: a pile of sand beach almost as large as the model started with a bath trail that carries it.
The orange rice bag, decorated with rags and finished with a white leather bag, was the highlights of the spring collection summer 2019 of Jacquemus' La Riviera in the Paris fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to the FC: 'I hope that the big shadows and beach bags will reach the tents next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community matters.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) are striving to provide the best level for students and their parents.
Private schools have the goal of preparing their students soo for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a plan of studies to measure, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, that comes to his head.
But if you speak to him in your own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the table and with higher approval rates in private schools.
A 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an excess.
The data, compiled from 74 schools that comply with SCIS, show that 72% of the students received an honor matrix in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an excess.
This shows that Swedish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, languages are taking the same consideration as materials such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and in all kinds.
A survey carried out by the Commission on Employment and Training in the United Kingdom in 2014 indicated that among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why entrepreneurs are costing them to cover vacations.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly necessary to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, as there are more working possibilities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will put a person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case a 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for today's children.
Getting to know a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages vary according to school.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others are based on the most important languages for the United Kingdom in the face of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what their children's interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialized teachers in this field.
Swedish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to triune, whatever their future.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages are still vital for the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "International communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
You need to do it.
John Edwards is head of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron started with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the sailors who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team instructor, Like Walton, announced that James will play the early part of the premier against the dinner Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still remains to decide how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell published on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training for a week's training, James was asked about his plans at the premise of six Lakers.
At these heights of my career, I don't need to be on time to be ready," he said.
Trump's electoral actions arrive in Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaigns this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the 5 mins programmed by Trump for next week, including the stops in cities near it, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a stand-alone vote for his candidate to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to receive support for the next half-mand, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia and how can you see it online?
The Tromp mit in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m.
You can see Trump's myth in West Virginia to follow through online retransmission via YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the subject of the trial held this week at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who hold the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of this series of miniins is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five minions that Trump will give next week have as their goal "to dynamicize volunteers and sympathy while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in front of the campaign time," said Reuters a trumpet champion who preferred not to be named.
The morning of this night, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together the sympathetic "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which it won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the investigation.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, politician of the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US Team shows up to fight and keep the hope alive until the individual parties on Sunday
After three individual sessions, the Friday morning morning could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum of impulse is a fully invented sports concept but in what athletes believe in truth, and especially in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They've got a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we'll take it as a little push," Jordan Spieth said while he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with sweeter in the game.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in favor and much to encourage, among other things, Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth has literally been from tea to green and is witnessing with example.
These rubber rings were stronger than they were in their round, making a crucial pout to attract the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points below two.
When he got the pott that made them win the game at 15, he hit a similar bear, the guy who says he thinks the US team is still not out.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only one left for these players now.
18 holes to let go of.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four and cannot make mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on the evening, but they also avoided them on the Saturday morning, on the Friday afternoon, and not the last nine holes on the Friday morning.
That passage, and the way it seems to flow its energy towards and from it, confirms them as the rivals to beat Sunday, and could not have more popular players to win when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
preferable both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly disappeared from Sergio García, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, when he joined Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended up with Spanish and Swedish in a hole they've never been close to going out.
But on Sunday there'll be no one to help get out of the hole.
The furballs and fursoms are so fascinating to see close to the interaction between couples, the advice they give, which is not the way in which a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage the last day, but this forum session also showed that the United States team has had the strength to fight, something that some, especially stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the suburbs and the forums with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The dual inspiration formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to raise four points to the marker in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophie they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning football, placing the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the Forsoms, winning four games, but they couldn't cut the profit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophi.
Fleetwood is the first new European to win four points, while Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a seven-week sensitious weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four starting parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After exaggerating Woods and Patrick Reed on the Fourballs, they qualified to defeat a Woods decomposed and new U.S. Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categories.
Woods, who argued two parties on the Sunday without punishment or glory, showed occasional flashlights, but now he lost 19 out of 29 parties in the fashions of furballs and fursoms and five followed.
Justin Rose, who would rest in the suburbs this morning, met again as his partner Henrik Stenson in the forums with a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three of the world's.
Europe could not always win a pleasant day of spring in the south-west of Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas champions set the point of reference for the United States getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory on Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter on the Fourballs and won the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 on the Fores after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in the history of Ryder Cup in which a team resonates four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to be empathized to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, an attack on Sunday seems to be out of its reach.
Cora do Norte not to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased its confidence in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced to the Annual General Assembly that North Korea would take "important measures to demonstrate its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismanding nuclear testing camps and committed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding answer by the US."
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, no unilateral disarmament will be first on our part."
While Ri repeated the well-known Norwegian complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization due to which North Korea would be rewarded as it took measures, its declaration seemed important, since it did not deny unilateral denuclearization as happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has since its mother sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that the first Pyongyang should deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearization" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive act, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us miserable is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions undermine our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead spot."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different than last year, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations it was inevitable to attack the United States with Norwegian missiles after the "bad president" Trump was called Kim "the man shot in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened with "complete destruction" of North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take action for disarmament, but said that there is still much work to do and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is denuclearized.
The Merchant Trump said there was no time for it, and that "the same thing takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompey, told the UN Security Council: "The compliance with the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has consistently increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had made progress, only a few hours ago that North Korea was accused of making "majous indolences".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to disarm a missile use, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "responsible measures".
He indicated that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more so as to fight the growth of the machinist culture to study all night inspired by caffeine.
One academic found that students at the University number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Müller, designed the course, which he believes is the first of these in the United States.
It was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl arrived and said to me, 'Why are they just telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had spoken to him about the importance of sleeping, what surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sound habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that the students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of a long time implies a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee bags, cortinas, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects the athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at the time of the day.
In another section, participants are informed how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain damage, depression and cancer.
A map of the camps with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students will not change their behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, so we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend all night awake still exists, and it adds that modern technology and the pressure on the students who were involved in the lack of sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps well enough and that he has a sound of good quality must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety. Including refraining from sneezing, since the lack of sleep makes the brain between initiation mode, which makes him constantly famous.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course throughout the campus.
The next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider the option of setting up an alarm to relax, as well as when they wake up. Also, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light" that emits electronics and LED lighting, which can neutralize the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol destroys Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack gave Steven Gerard's disarmed team a defeat for 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to record its first victory to the house from the triumph for 4-1 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team held the second defeat of Gerarrd in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points of Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest, and a random random Rangers alliance with little inspiration never made the feeling that it was going to happen.
While the Rangers fell to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a wave of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have treated a wound in his head with alleged launch of an object.
Gerarrd made eight changes to the team that drew Ayr at the semifinals of Bethfred Cup, the Scotch League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 of Livingston who took a point to the Hearts last week and would have been in love with the way his organized group had attacked his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the balloon.
They might have marked in just two minutes when the short pass of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's port, but the central champion lost this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only got him crucified in second place.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Of course, Alfredo Morelos felt that they should have been punished for 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the arbitrator, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only had two shots at the door in the first half, but the old guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head ending and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in 34 minutes could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong training.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher packed the balloon for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the rest when changing the Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, although it almost had an immediate effect when the jury took a break with Morelos, but the imputant Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long balloon behind each other.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor grew up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow was headed from the corner.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton, called for another penalty when he came in with Jacobs, but Thomson made it hard again.
Almanac: Geiger Count Inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136, and CONTADO... was the day the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger accountant.
A piece of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" ("The Coronado Camps"), protagonized by those seemingly insular vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these auriculars are placed, the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactive activity of the minerals can be heard."
Evans says, "I'm sure you're standing right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that takes his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the default cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, changing them in the laboratory
You can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, which are changed to the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impresses the growth of various types of cancer", including mothers, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immunosuppression of patients and "insinals" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded a speech in the favor of Trump when using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat pointing its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program (SNL).
And the result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they supported Kanye West in the study after a confusing presentation in which he commended US President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third night's song, Ghost Town ("Pantasma City"), in which he took a hill from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated their support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If he was concerned about racism, he would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a satellite protagonized by Matt Damon, where Hollywood stared at Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't issued, Chris Rock took pictures of West criticism on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get out of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the hearing that he had passed a bad time in the tankers because of his pride.
"They've been with me in the bazaars.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I'm scared!
And then they said I was going to the pike," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick me up?" saying, "Use my superman top, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try with love."
His comments provoked applause in the audience at least two times and the members of the SNL list seemed to be embarrassed, reported to the magazine Variety, with the following witness that a person there gave the publication: "All the study remained completely silent."
They had been named West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the short Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many perplex people with an interpretation of the song I love it ("Encantame"), dressed as a water bottle Perrier.
West won the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the most powerful spirits: Thank you for FACER FRANCE TO MAFIA"
However, the representative of an interview programme, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "to be who it is and that's completely wonderful".
"And yet, I chose not to reward anyone (by understanding his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who I think is putting on and spreading a ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us," added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder by torture at the restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The accused is expected to be present before the Belfast Court of Justice on Monday.
The Public Tax Service will review the charges.
Game of Thrones Star, Kit Harington, attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword management role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The actor, who was 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of machinist hero, saying that these fingers on the screen are translated into what appears to be the boys that have to be hard for them to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently happened to the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he feels "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"In particular, I feel pretty strong at this moment. In what do we make a mistake with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very male personalities.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes boys feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how did we change that?
Because, obviously, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he won't do any prequalification or game of Thrones when the series comes to its end next summer, saying that "a lot of horses and fields of battle."
From November, Kit will protagonize a True West (The True West), from Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so, of course, she gave me my future family and my life here before," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple happened in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities have declared.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted sexually, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had practically been reduced to zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in international terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people was extended.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men having sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters decides that a member of the staff will filter data from the senators of the Republican Party, "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters charged that a member of his staff had published personal information from three United States Republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia of the readers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat stated that the declarations were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultradereity".
"Ministers, lies and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a Twitter statement.
According to the findings, the dissemination of information included the individual addresses and telephone numbers of Utah's US Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a hearing of the Senate panel on inappropriate sexual conduct charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filter appeared shortly after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters Department and revealed information from a member of the Waters staff, communicated to Capitol Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were committed as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the filtering of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
The subsequent Waters statement raised online criticisms, including those of the former Secretary of Press of the White House, Ari Fleescher.
"This rejection was made with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"Let me understand you don't have time to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he doesn't have to get angry.
You must not appear to be a challenger.
You must not question the reasons of the accused.
It must remain practical and serious."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, when critics accused him of being too angry at hearing the jokes.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was present to disband Waters in the medium term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true" shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the entities responsible for compliance with the law and appropriate authorities with these fraudulent charges.
"We will ensure that we find the guilty," he continued, "as well as that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my team."
Critic of Johnny English Strings Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), the paradigm of the powerless spy of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcedent in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can apply to the return of the French of this parody and comedy of action by Johnny English, who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the irony turn about the obvious stupid issue that we are on the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any way, the incompetence character of Johnny English's eye saltons and rubber face renewed his license to destroy things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comical creation designed for non-englophone cinema territories.
Of course, it is the poor secret agent who, despite his extraordinary claims of adult glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a chip by Mr. Bean and a bunch of that kind that contributed with a single note on the theme of the Fire Cars in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also based originally on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interprets now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, where he planted the fall on his way.
There's a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medium-duty armor and the rotor's steps make a short drive against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the view, but it gives the impression that humor has little power and is extremely superfluous, especially when this type of film "serious", such as 007 and the Impossible Mission, has already used the comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed to children instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagances are not as gregarious or concentrated as the film chips moved from Atkinson when facing the character of Bean.
Now the permanent topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cybernetic pirate infiltrates into the UK's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents in the area, for the anxiety of the service agent, a poor little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the collapse for a prime minister who has been in conflict, who has already suffered a total crisis of political instability: Emma Thompson gives you the best of himself with this person who almost seems Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence consultants know that as all spies are committed, someone will have to get out of the retreat.
And that refers to incompetence Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives extraordinary classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some chips, when English offers the spasy academy to a rock school.
They take the English back to Whitehall for an information session of emergency and meet with their former and suffering partner Bugh, re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an exciting role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
Because Batman and Robin of the wrongs of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful dead woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the first minister is playing a dangerous role in the enchanting of the multibillion-technological charisma which claims he can solve the British computer problems: Jason Volta left, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bugh begin their hate of ridiculous falsified falsifiers: chaspased, they fire a French host restaurant; they create a tower that illegally puts them on the edge of the Volta luxury ice; and English causes the total anarchy to try to use virtual reality boxes to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta house.
Of course, all the detentions come out of that last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems to come out of a child television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as happened with Johnny English's other films, they can't avoid thinking: the British cinema industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Laborist Party refuses to design a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover five
Today, the party wants entrepreneurs to spend the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an additional day free.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
The sources say the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to guide the country to the benefit of the workers.
The Syndicate Congress supported four days a week's journey as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to night, but a working week of four days is an ambition that is adapted to the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a working week of four days during its campaign for the general elections in 2017.
However, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesman from the Labour Party said: "A working week of four days does not go into the party's politics and is not being considered by this."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "expectors" in public service companies.
The plans of the Chancellor in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover their entire investment, as a labour government could make "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers in business councils and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the private sector's shares to employees, which make annual dividends of up to 500 £.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question was raised as to whether the department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, at the release of an interview, the "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could take out something that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy showed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the prosecution came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems immeasurable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett did round it," added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he mentioned could not verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive record of stars that have acted and a equally impressive mission, ending with world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people arriving in the Great Law area of Central Park, not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness about the real goal of ending the event with poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that looks forward to ending poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant public had to complete a number of tasks or "actions", such as doing a volunteer, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen in 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with free concerts is a curious way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of what is called "clicitism", people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, promoting a set of different objectives.
He claims that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and ads derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or reimbursed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK company of investors and executives who committed themselves to "help children develop to their maximum potential", with a promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Global Citizen tweets.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the sick, the national authorities and the sympathy of Global Citizen like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a note on the page of history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the project The Power of Nutrition that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-parity movements and in favour of the civil rights that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the sea to carry out a "block" to make Russia's energy exports difficult, U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced
"Where necessary," Washington may travel to the sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, from developing the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the institutions of the legitimate government operate, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," he said, according to reports.
In addition, according to the official, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, together with the sea, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not going to the market," he said.
Zinke directed the participants to the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, in the use and replacement of fuels," he commented, while referring to Russia saying that "it has only a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The declarations were made while the Tromp administration was in a mission to encourage exports of its natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 oil project, which, according to Trump, converted Berlin into "cativo" in Moscow.
Moscow reiterated that the North Stream oil of $11 billion, which was established to double the capacity of the oil existing at 110 billion cubic meters, is a major economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the idea that energy can't be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, who brought a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US position resulted in Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German sector leader organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI, by its German signals), called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third State intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, BDI president, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren carefully examined his invitation to the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he would carefully review his application to the presidency for mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his application.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repeat the broken government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my application to the presidency."
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, saying he was "to take this country for the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The next day, Warren commented on a tweet "of course there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, in a survey published on chess, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters do not believe it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said that the senator would not submit his application, according to the survey of the political research center at Suffolk University and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidate.
The survey showed more support for the candidate of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidate and 48 per cent counter.
Other names of Democrats in relation to a possible candidate in 2020 include former vice president, Joe Biden, and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially before January, he informed the Associated Press Agency.
Sarah Palin quotes the post-uramatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in Donald Trump's myth
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
Monday night, they arrested them and accused them of an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," explained Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans, "are different, confused, wondering if there is any reason why military and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They arrested them on Mondays in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged them with domestic violence against a woman, which interfered in a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was a Jew, according to Dan Bennett, the officer of the police department of Vasilla.
18 states and the Columbia District challenge the new asylum policy
Twelve states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy in relation to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
The next day, the representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum applicant who challenged politics, reported to NBC News.
The full name of the party requesting the price of Grace v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States by Civil Liberties) did not appear in August against federal policy.
She realized that her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that the U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on 20 June.
Detivated in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum applicants for the United States, as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants who escaped domestic violence to request asylum.
The general prosecutor of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislations".
"The federal bill requires all asylum applications to be assisted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and states a prohibition against that principle" explained in the court's friendly report.
Taxers continued to debate the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants gives the US economy, explaining that it is likely that they will become entrepreneurs and that they "give hand to work".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to refrain from granting asylum to victims of domestic ill-treatment and the violence of criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their policy announcement on 11 June.
The asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu to the extent that the number of victims is doubled in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby February in the city center of the city of Palu.
"Every minute there comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their wrong properties, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are disintegrated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured the bones and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated in the open air due to continuous and strong replications.
His eyes filled with tears as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake seized the hotel room in the fifth floor that shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall shook me, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, and added that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then only silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of abuse with "propagandistic ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a newspaper in the United States requesting the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, made reference to the additional payment of China Daily at the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the elections to the US Congress, which will be held on 6 November, making China refuse.
Trup's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections, noted what officials in the country did in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to co-operate in China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing commercial war bearing witness to the tariff level in their respective imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, China's countervailing tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to pre-empt State exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Tromp Party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and ex-government of Iowa, one of the main exporters of agricultural products in China, stated that Beijing has threatened workers, farmers and North American entrepreneurs.
In an article of opinion written by Branstad and published in the edition of the Monday of the Moines Register, it was said that China is "intensifying this campaign of appeal by spreading propaganda ads in the United States free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is benefiting from the cherished North American tradition of freedom of expression and of press advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the place of newspapers located at the end of this street of Beijing, there are few dissident voices and no real reflection of the opinions that the Chinese may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under the strong influence of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he claims that "one of China's most important newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm what the newspaper is dealing with.
Kavanaugh's disaster leaves women's Republican vote to a few days of half-mandatory elections
Although many of the main Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially among female voters, in the next half-mission elections.
The reactions to these allegations were numerous and the majority of Republicans were positioned to continue with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arison) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the souls of angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," reflected the Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, in Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, at the "Course November" flu, appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the supervision of the Judicial Committee, decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's witness, told Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that it's already high,
But it still goes further, especially among women who vote in favour of bars outside or who are between 18 and 29 years of age, who do not like the President, are not used to attend the Urs."
Before Ford's public witness described his allegations of sexual aggression against the candidates of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster to the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, the beginning of the week in the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of the accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the election of Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between believing in Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony, although they are more inclined to support this last one.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe in Ford's testimony entirely or probably, compared to 35% who supports Kavanaugh's witness.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is probably lying during his witness, facing a 30% who thinks for the same reason.
The FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford witnessed before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in the state of puberty when he was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed the geniuses at a university party when he studied in Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee had the chance that the intention to hide Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "line personal data storage" or POD.
Contact lists, pending tasks, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single explorer at the same time.
All of this makes this personal data storage unique is that the user has full control over who can access the information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its President John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid become available to the whole world.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project and a volunteer programming community.
From this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about entering or not a complete change that would change their business models one day to another.
"We don't need his permission."
In an article published on Wednesday afternoon, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet to establish the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been raised as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as of the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new site," added Berners-Lee.
Welcome to Bernard Vann, a decorated clergyman with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only church in the Church of England that was concocted with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous honour in its birth city 100 years later.
The Colonel and Governor Bernard Vann was graduated on September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
However, he was killed by a franchisor four days later without knowing that he would be given the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, their two grandsons were charged with discovering a memorial monument in their honor in a file in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the façade of his grandfather who earned his title.
According to the publication London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a dense snow and under the play of an intense fire of meteors."
Later he was tempted to get to the fire line and, with a "great bravery," directed the line forward before facing him with a cannon and no one's help, and to defeat the three people of the enemy highlight.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German franciter on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live, but a lesson like that."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a flower crown after the file, which led to the young Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the show" and added that "the value of this genius hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut off the role of MMA officers at the best time
Imagine that you take all night smart to enjoy Bellator 206, and when the best part comes, something prevents you.
The map of San Jose included 13 battles, being six main ones, and was being forwarded directly to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But on the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald saw their faces, the United Kingdom spectators fell in applause when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some didn't impress them after they had spent so many hours waiting to see the fight.
One associate described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke".
"The royal state law that this content was not appropriate for the 6th morning, and therefore had to change to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, senior marketing vice president and Bellator's Communication, when he was asked about the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Cooker, President of Bellator, said that they will take account of United Kingdom spectators in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about the repeat," Coker said.
"But if it's 6 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the five wars, instead of six. We wanted to give the maximum to our loved ones, but we went and
I'll be very angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels lower due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to the whole world because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete claims that he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited from the first edition of the 4th Radio program Desert Island Discs led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to see the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual representative of this program, is sickly.
As invited by Laverne's first program, Daley shared that he felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "it was socially unacceptable that the children and the girls would like you".
So he said, "Even today, that feeling of inferiority and differentness is what motivated me and gave me the strength necessary to achieve success."
I wanted to prove it was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became an outstanding LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Australian Commonwealth games to ask the more countries to express homosexuality.
She decided to speak because she felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of the effects, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three times the world champion said he'd fall in love with U.S. actor Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "was a surprise."
Daley happened to this winner of a Oscar last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them have never been a problem.
"When you live so little time" (with only 14 years of age who participated for the first time in Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who's experiencing similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you ask me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son was entries for London 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
"I didn't know who to tell you I wouldn't be here to take care of that first line," shared Daley.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that exact moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that it was really not inevitable," he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that it was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling" confirmed.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not going either, because it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair at the point.

Mickelson's down at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
The U.S. Phil Mickelson will play a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th part of Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unhappy event.
Mickelson, who participated in the 12th anniversary event, stayed in the bank by the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the Saturday's Forsoms.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many times for the United States, the five times the campaign went through the day encouraging and working to improve its movements.
Although it was never the most necessary of the players, not even at the time of his career, at the age of 48 he did not fit in the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high-school herb used to punish the wrong shots.
And because this wasn't enough, Mickelson faced on the ninth Sunday at the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parties this week.
If the United States, four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, start with good foot, the action of Mickelson could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, though he couldn't say much more.
"You perfectly understood the role I played today, gave me a palm in my shoulder, stretched my arm, and told me that tomorrow I would be ready," said Furyk.
"I fully trusted myself.
He has a prominent place in the Fama Hall and contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end it's things and we think it should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
You could mark the end of your career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of your individual palmerese.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 wins and seven shares, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intensive equipment.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with a genius and he likes to meet people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I'd like to see if you've been through it or younger players with this week.
It's a lot more with a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, is afraid of the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup's individual can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Grand Danes started in 1997 at a party in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the United States, but they finally reached the target line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You keep thinking that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; like Brooklyn, where we lost, but Valderrama won for a while," Bjorn reflected in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion winning 5-3 Friday and, last night, 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History shows that this has not yet ended.
Tomorrow we have to go to everyone.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying that, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but they're also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted with the performance of his players in a hard golf field, Bjorn added: "No singing won before time.
We'll meet the other animal tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we have to prove our validity.
It's great to be with a partner on the side when things go well, but when you face things individually, then try your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to send to players, which takes the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he should also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will find that his players have a better individual performance than his peers, the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who were three points of four.
The Furyk himself was in two extremes of these rounds of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ending up as a loser through the European miracle in Medinah."
"I remember each of the bad words," he answered when he was asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, met the players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brooklyn or Medinah.
When you see the pulse goes in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We prepare our alliance taking this into account and put the players as we thought, we want to do the maximum tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the classification.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship once more
The latest piece of German Army should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not reach at least the next year due to defective systems and increasingly cost, the local media reported.
The post in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the battalion-class flammable battalion Baden-Weerttemberg, joined up until the first half of 2019, and reported a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into Mariña in 2014, but the subsequent delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class boats, which the Armada was responsible for in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class fractured.
It is understood that they will count with a powerful cannon, with different anti- heretics and anti-bukes, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods of maintenance, it should be possible to spread the newer fragments up to two years outside the port of origin.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be ancient when they enter service.
The fragile F125 was news last year, when the German Army officially engaged in commissioning the ship and returned it to the castle Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time Mariña returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" that prevented the use of the warship on a battle mission.
Software deficits were particularly important, as Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 mariners, i.e. half of the staff needed in the old Bremen class broken.
In addition, he discovered that the ship had an excess of dramatic weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of Marina to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7 thousand-tonnes Rhineland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the default hardware, the total project price, which includes the training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the amazing amount of EUR 3300 million is already reached, compared with the 2200 million initials.
The problems of the new ones are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's shipping power is making waves.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that Mariña is staying without suitable ships to unload.
The official claims that this problem is increasingly, as old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
At the same time, he regretted that none of the Baden-Weerttemberg class fractures could join Marina.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the dogs
A new research being carried out at a corner of Scotland's Highlands aims to reveal how the ants use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these single travelers and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the Association National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the Myotis duubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverwe in West Ross.
Special recording teams are located in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the ants during the time.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile searches with manual detectors.
An analysis of sound carried out by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls of the ants and that is being done by each species.
Next, a habit map will be developed to create a detailed image on the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation consultant, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important for mammals and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of forests and what is the best way to keep forests for insects and other associated species.
The population of swine fever in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of life.
Air generators and aluminum also pose a risk, as well as muscle grip straps, some chemical treatment of construction materials and domestic cat attacks.
The dogs aren't blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes at the time of hunting.
They use a sophisticated eco-calculation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taking seriously the garbage.
It contains ten trained experts, carrying out periodic surveys, child inspections and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization also has the only and first reserve of Scotland's trive estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the eighth of the ten species of Scotland's.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Treve we have a great area for dogs," he says.
"We have old buildings, historical trees and a wonderful habit.
But there's a lot of things we don't know about the kids yet, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of infants before carrying out maintenance tasks in the property, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child could kill up to 400 women and children, which could end all local population.
Dogs are a protected species and they are illegally killed, tortured, or abused, as well as destroying their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"We still have much to learn about the mammals and, in the case of many species, we don't know how he's going to his populations."
Ronaldo rejects the demands for rape and his lawyers are ready to ask the German publication
Christian Ronaldo qualifies the accusations of rape against him as a lie, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know him by using his name.
Your lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish these charges.
The president of Portugal and the Juventus was charged with violating Kathryn Mayorga, a U.S. woman at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that the footballist paid the woman $375 000 so she didn't say anything about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, closed this fake news in a video directly from his Instagram account, which accounts for 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," said the camera the winner of the Gold Balloon five times.
"People want to get to know you by using my name.
It's normal,
They wanted to be famous with just saying my name, as part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to ask Der Spiegel for charges, which qualify as "an unacceptable statement of suspicions in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would ask for compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino de Las Vegas.
After being known in a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga would have returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anyway, according to the documents presented in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was exaggerated saying he was a 99% knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both maintained sexual relations permitted by both parties.
Majorga also maintains that he attended the police and that he had photographs of the wounded, but later he entered into an extrajudicial agreement because he felt devastated by the arrests and was worried about the public scandal.
A 34-year-old woman says she's trying to withdraw the agreement while she's still traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer incorporated the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would abandon the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would always mourn the loss of its place as world car manufacturing leader after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK would say in the BBC that if Great Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The manufacturer of Japanese cars said that, if Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which was responsible for the manufacture of the Auris and Avenis models in Toyota, produced about 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the subcontractor chain in the event of failure to reach an agreement in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very adjusted, every 37 minutes it comes from United Kingdom and EU suppliers for vehicles to be measured.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the border could be affected and could be delayed and missing.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rate more than one day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says that theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success but also take advantage of this opportunity," said today's BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent sub-ministerial gifts."
Toyota could not estimate how long the production would stop, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce the plant's competence and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed by Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator of Unite, said his members are increasingly concerned: "For experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A representative of the government stated that they presented a precise and critical plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be resumed
The White House stated that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and the Deputy Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed a week later due to the fight by the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
As long as Trump sends the deputy general tax officer, as if he does not, what would endanger Mueller's independence, he ate the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of withdrawing to the President by amendment 25.
However, Rosenstein made the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that he was about to give up.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was found in New York, the wolves.
Trump said he would rather not have to dissemble Rosenstein, but the meeting delayed to avoid a shock at the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
The next day, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or another week, given all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists questioned that claim, since Sanders has been holding a press round since September 10th.
When the rapporteur Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information session was not due to an aberration to the majority of reporters, although he added that she would not be the one who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president grants more interviews than the former president," he said, although he did not mention any source that evaluates these data.
Information meetings will continue to be held, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask him directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than to address the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we have done this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press round in which you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when leaving Casa Branca or participating in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, single press conferences are few.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the journalists assembled.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the souls before Brexit
The Health Secretariat has sent a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its desire to remain in the country beyond Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months that the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed itself to covering the cost of public service requests covered for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the leave continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this autumn.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom, by its side, has also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a period of inconsistencies for everyone.
I would therefore like to reiterate the value of the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union and beyond provide an indispensable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Escocia is your cook and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker from Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of the Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the coach of Tennessee State, told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he was disappointed when he got to the gang line.
The teachers and the medical personnel gave him oxygen on the band line before carrying it on a camel to carry out a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are no details of the type or the extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when this injury was produced.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year of red shirt, is in his first time with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the party, which raised his total of the time.
A stamp tax will apply to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help people who are not interested in the new conservation plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasure waits to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help people without getting caught
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help people without charge.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible lives and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money will serve to support the government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The recharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second living and purchases to rent, may be up to 3 %.
Facenda expects the change to pay up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new buildings in London are marketed by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing a price increase and making it difficult for people who want to buy a living for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in capital, have become "pantasma cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson is asked to apply a cut in the fines transmission tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He told the great builders to keep the prices of the high living by buying the sun and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderate price houses in order to set up the "difficulty of the lifestyle" that is in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals in relation to life, including the control of tenants and the prohibition of difficulties in which the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the larger collections the time to build new living cells.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mission to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And to that end, it is necessary to set up the destructive market of life.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses based on foreigners, to buy live animals than for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a lifetime is too far, and the indigence that they suppose does not have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to teach Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, stated that his "last ambition" is being converted to Scotland's electorate for a while.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club in the northwestern, currently occupying the third floor in League One, the three points of distance from the head.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last spring.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that's all," Ross said to the sportsound program of the BBC Scotland.
"I used to see Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when he was a boy, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland trainer's position include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel worried about any of these so consolidated figures in a club so big after he had previously rejected proposals from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will depend on this moment if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly own from a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to come, but it's probably just to think that I've succeeded here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross only takes three years as an instructor after a period of assistant in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within the technical staff of Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and made St. Mirren be quick to descend to win the title of the Championship at the next time.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he has ever found during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I've probably found myself in a real crucible," he recalled, about taking care of Allia.
"I really thought teaching was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It's weird because it wasn't bad for me, I got a reasonable life, and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure at work, but to learn to like it.
I always liked to teach and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but it put more pressure on restaurants.
The pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 percent during lunch, but the consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's business consultant, who was responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and the stay of England in the football world for more time than expected caused in July a similar pattern to appear, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered even more punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of restaurants during June increased during lunch.
The pubs and barges specialized in drinks were the best results obtained with increases in consumption above the cuts experienced by restaurants.
The pubs specialized in food also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out of here.
In pubs and bars controlled drinking consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, used by RSM to analyze leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has occurred since the end of April.
Time and impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors related to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly painful if this adds to the continuing increase in costs.
The heat and long summer could not have come at a worse time for restoration business and time will be charged to say whether the moderate temperatures experienced during August will provide the necessary breathing for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during lunch, which reflects deceleration in brand releases.
The sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry of the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with total profits of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector reference point.
One out of every five children has secret social networks that hide their parents
One out of every five children (some of them only 11 years old) have secret social networks accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "false Insta"
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
One of five children (some of them only 11 years old) are creating social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 secondary students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts (in reference to the social network for the exchange of Instagram photos).
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a soft "primary" account to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked for her to be raped.
The research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private accounts.
HMC's manager, Mike Buchanan, said: "It turns out alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create spaces online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eliidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics as non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Governing Council.
Doyle is the most talented Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from their wide experience at international level over the past decade.
"There is a great deal of interest in the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit greatly from its inclusion in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I've got a lot of desire to make athletes' careers and I hope I can contribute and help direct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four other Olympics and currently working as a regular commentator for BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from traveling.
He wrote on Twitter: "There's a month of suffering a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until I was hungry.
It was an exhausting job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I now do axilization exercises.
Thank you for the message of the soul."
An announcement by a breast milk extractor compared to women with cows divided by public opinion on the networks
A parent milk extractor company shared public opinion on the networks with an announcement that compares milking mothers to cows that are moving.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "first silent mother milk extractor of the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new milk extractor offers to the girls.
Four royal mothers dance in a celebrity full of fire for the cows at the rhythm of a song with letters such as, "Yes, I've moved myself, but I don't have it" and "Because you don't care, I'm not hungry, they're my pets."
The heart continues: "Museum, mux, I'm feeding babies, mux, mux, I'm moving my friends."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions between the viewers. Many of them claimed that this appearance was the "shocks" of the dairy sector.
"Useing cows to announce this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give the light to produce milk, but in their case we stole their children the days after giving the light," wrote one.

Another viewer commented: "It's clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use it to announce a milk extractor for the mothers who are left with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What I announce with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even a woman said that the song seemed "very nice".
"I think it's a great idea.
If he was still giving the pie, he'd buy one.
Taking away my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little bit disarmed, but I've interpreted it as a joke.
I look like a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad directed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "wakas".
This is not an announcement to leave or judge the milk industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the extractive discrets inserted in their suggestions.
The concept based on the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can easily fit into a maternal proposer, which gives women the freedom to move, suggest their babies and even get out of there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, executive creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a humiliating and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism existing between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges involved as we demonstrated in an interesting and close manner the incriminating sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time the Elvie extractor takes over the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures flew off the path to the designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were silently moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased despite the relatively invariable number of border crossings, partly due to the rhetorical burden and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which made it difficult to assign fathers to children.
Traditionally, most parents were also immigrants without papers and were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the possible parents and other adult members of their camps would have to send their digital catches and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-level U.S. Immigration and Customs Control Service, witnessed before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked for abortions without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are parents or who are part of the fire are found in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who commit crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials introduced new standards that would require some of them to be compared to the judge before he passed a month from his detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the refugee workers.
Many will be represented by videoconferencing instead of person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they remain under guard, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may cause violent arrests or attempts to escape by the refugee workers and system reports published in the last few months.
Lawyers claimed that these fears increased in centres of greater dimensions than Tornillo, where there are more possibilities than the symptoms that a child is suffering from misperception due to its size.
They also added that moving children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to leave friends could be a tragedy that many have continued to suffer.
Syria requests the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the United Nations General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently taking place in their eighth year.
Moualem, who is also in charge of Deputy Prime Minister Vice, said that foreign forces were found in only illegally, with the intention of fighting terrorism, and that they would be "occupied in an appropriate manner".
"You must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country destroyed by the war.
On the refugee issue, Moulalem stated that the conditions were given for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dispersion of irrational media" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We will go to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a major humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was concluded.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last large rebel ship of Idlib allowed for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would have the fate of the dissidents, including the Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be expelled".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to prepare a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moulalem expressed the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second job
Following this logic, Mr Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency in a premature manner.
That would certainly be the most dramatic end of a presidency.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue between observers.
Since 2014, first-time audits have multiplied by more than two, reaching the 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million with regard to Nielsen four years ago, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the cable channel audiences with 3.5 million viewers during the nights in which important news was produced.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for the ABC "Designed Survival", which is a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedian writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver commented that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? I asked him.
"He said, 'Why do I laugh,' said Mrs. Scowell to me.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the steps of Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case if immigrant families can reunite themselves and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only privileged viewers can be allowed.
Still, he says something that goes beyond being a informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate on the use made by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's stick-blower of $15,000 ("a full of pride", said Washington Pos) and the implications of the scathing descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that you're giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with changes in the characters and daily argumentaries of the Trump show (the conflict with N.F.L., the exhilarations to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to lose an episode or stay behind.
When I was in contact with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house on the north coast of Kaui, but he was locked in the house and sold the MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He was unable to resign while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court pending a trial.
"Remember when we were doing all these programs so all at that time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss commented.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to interest to fund the candidates to the Camera for the election of half of the lecture
It is not surprising that the 17th convention district of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a convention district with two representatives in careers to take the same place.
This district located outside Pittsburg, which has recently been reorganized, is represented by the democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who achieved his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is present against another representative in functions, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is superseded by a great deal on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the Republicans would manipulate the electoral circulation of the former districts in favour of it.
The electoral career in the new 17th district of Congress rejected a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Committee on the Democratic Campaign of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching an adjusted victory in the special March elections for the 18th convention district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
This position was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give democracies an advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of penalising the Salvadorn for its support to China and then pushed back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even had a hotel in Panama until his partners broke off the Trump Organization's steering team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to order the heads of the United States diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the representative of the department in a statement made this month.
However, it was only possible to apply sanctions against Salvador, which received approximately 140 million US dollars of aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas, would have been very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials encouraged the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent the emigration of people towards the United States.
But by mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to progress, effectively ending any possibility of applying sanctions to the Salvadoran people.
It is scheduled that Vice-President Mike Pence will lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance of administration, the diplomats have said.
The three North American emissaries returned discreetly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesman from Mr. Bolton's White House commented on the details of the debate, which were described by the three North American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations always and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
Their accounts were reinforced by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever their anonymity was maintained.
History
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice, which currently has ample evidence in the public file.
According to him, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign was designed with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to account in that body, just when he has to prepare for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very unknown and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall will be inevitable, just as did his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to attack Hitler if the western front was opposed and supported by the Czechs in Múnic.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that have occurred later.
The course of history revolves around these inflation points, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is facing several of these inflation points at these times.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sends the Deputy State Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein took the water to the pocket since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested writing in secret to the president and expressed that he was incapacitated for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information of The Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or not impartial or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the serious allegations of sexual and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the election of half-leasing by a Congress that demands responsibility for Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied my home as well, who knew of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to take Shabat's changes on that table that included a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Player of Rangers Graham Dorrans is an optimist of face to face against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna jokes knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive hit in Spain against the Villarreal this month, would place them in a very favourable position to classify themselves in the G group of Europe League.
An injury on the knee prevented central champion Graham Dorrans from detaching this time to the empath 2-2 in front of Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game believing that we could get something positive and reach a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, the empath is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second half we were superior.
The next Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good outcome in their last game, but with the support of our public, I am sure that we can fight to achieve a positive outcome.
Last year was hard between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the team, but there is a great environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are going well and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget the past time and succeed."
Women care about their savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear as they wanted them to care, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide said that they commented on their partners the cost of the prolonged care.
Only 10% said they'll talk to their children about the subject.
"People want you to take care of a family, but they are not taking the necessary steps to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Department.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family so they can't care if you don't tell them your wishes with a lot of advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to find out where and how to get the attention, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among the long-term care financing options is a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that is effective to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Trade your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that professionals do what you want if you are unable to communicate.
It also appreciates the possibility of signing a non-remarkable power to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your father or mother has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medicines and your allergy?
Please provide details on this information in a written plan to be prepared.

A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdominal and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 (British summer time) as a "alternative act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Their wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Terremotos and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to increase.
Due to the shortness of the communications, the rescue bodies could not obtain any information from the Donghia regenence, a area located in the north of Palu which is closer to the earth's center of 7.5 degrees magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided them with some key data on Palu and Dondria, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dondria is a regent that is located over 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regent, an administrative region below a province, accounted for a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dodhea.
Nikhal mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dodhria were affected by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrya.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dongrya in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the High-Sysmetic Pacific Fire Cinth, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Xava, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, causing almost 700 people to die.
2009: It produced a 7.6-degree magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake affected the Isle of Mentawai, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and caused about 300 people to die.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regeneration of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
On this occasion no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily displaced.
Arrest of Sarah Palin's eldest son on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was accused of aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, of Vasilla, Alaska, was suspected of a domestic violence crime, preventing the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin remains in pre-trial prison in the units of Mat-Su Pretreal Facility with a loan of $500, as KTUU reported.
He presented himself before the judge on the Sabbath, in which he declared "not guilty, ever since" when he was questioned, reported the case.
Palin faced three minor types of A crimes, which means he could enter prison for up to a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor crime of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time there are criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the alleged attack.
The case is currently found in the Alaska War Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, preventing the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and possession of weapons in Hebrew state in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of putting a bullet in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that he suffered after serving with the army in Iraq.
A earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
It is reported that at least 384 people died after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of flames.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and it is expected that the death balance will increase with the passing of days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of Central Celebes, in the north of the Indonesian capital, Yacarta.
They circulate videos by the social networks in which the moment of impact is displayed.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal taxes seek to apply a few times applied death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of New York's terrorist attack that took place on the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike on the West Side Highway Avenue of Lower Manhattan, killing the lives of the pony and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentiously" and that he caused serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the death penalty request submitted in the South New York District.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the document of the judge.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by criminal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of vehicles in the motor vehicle.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors declared by describing the way Saipov carried out the "study, cruel and excessive" targeted.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco" as indicated in the notice of intention of prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, New York South District didn't process a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to the lasting chain in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, nothing in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack in accordance with court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, as the police said.
Saipov declared to the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos that he showed on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It was declared innocent of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "publicly disappointed" with the decision of the accused.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with an endless chain without the possibility of repossessment will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all persons involved," Patton commented.
Saipov's defence team will first ask the taxpayers who do not ask for the death penalty.
A Tory parliamentarian states that NIGEL FARGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "moving a "people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians had to "press" Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that negotiations with the EU should take place.
The ordinary Member Peter Bone said before the Birmingham event that the United Kingdom would have "went out" of the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided lines of her party was evident when the Tories were united to remain in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The first minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the opposites and the EU's.
Their allies stressed that they continued to fight to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their plan and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave movement of Solihull that he wanted to finish with the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be informed of the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If it had been given in charge, we would already be out of the EU at the moment," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must cancel the Chequers plan".
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone made the suggestions indicating that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and that they want to stay in the EU is completely false".
The member of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns' storytelling party also attended, since he showed the reporters: "The only thing I'm saying is: first minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among the public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, is impotence between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are those who care for the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The first ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 reference.
"This is currently a subject of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and we're here today to tell them we won't let them go with you."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are moving the army of the people of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the parties to remain in the EU conducted a march through Birmingham before a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A number of activists went on pankarts with the message Tories Against Brexit (Tories against Brexit) after the group's mail on this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis bulsed the conservatives by the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute phrase.
The concept of good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren planned to seriously think about presenting himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider his candidate to the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a municipal session in a location in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Tromp campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It was focused on speculations that took place as a result of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its voters using the form of the church since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren replied that it is the moment when "we women go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and that makes a woman misses the presidency".
A arrest related to Sims's death shot, the LSU player
The Baton Rouge police, the Ánxeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wade Sims, the LSU's ball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, in a press round held at 11:00 (the hour of the east).
They'll publish a video from the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was out in the pictures.
Sims, aged 20, was killed by shootings near the campus of Southern University the first hour of the Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of it," reported police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to be present on the scene with a gun and admitted to shoot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a young man 2 meters old in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 reboots per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton gets to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It has been clear since Valtteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was from the field, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the first box and let Hamilton run traffic in the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the boxes a little later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton made progress after several rounds that caused Ferrari's driver to leave the inside at risk of being delayed after a double defensive manoeuvre in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went back to the seventh floor at the end of the first time on his 21st anniversary.
Then he led the course during a large part of this thanks that he kept his pneumatics to get faster in the final part and to advance Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
He finally entered boxes around 44 but couldn't move any position on the last eight times, which ended with Raikkonen on the fourth floor.
It was a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real knight.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two spaces," Hamilton said.
A low-latency body language
President Donald Trump disappointed Senator Diane Feinstein in an act that was celebrated on Saturday by his insistently stating that he would not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech carried out in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford to the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented on the place where what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "merciful, repugnant and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last days of the Senate, when anger is seen, when it is seen that people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any filters?
Remember your answer... you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Filter him?...No.", add to the senator's imitation.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein insisted that the filter should come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the committee, as reported to the newspaper The Hill.
"I asked him to keep his confidentiality and do what he asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night act: "I tell you that the body language was not the proper one.
He may not be filtered, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power through any means necessary.
They are evil and rebellious, they don't care who give, who have to struggle to regain power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two yellows for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat the Friday in Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the 5-3 rounds in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won a quick advantage through two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie arrived at the local compound before Dwyer restored the Giant's advantage.
Francois Bouchard sent them to Dundee before two of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's balls enabled them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the Times for Adam Keefe's men, who were able to go back to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time meeting between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories in the Giants prol.

An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered hero after death to ensure that a passenger-loaded aircraft with hundreds of passengers can be safely disbanded.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a great earthquake took place on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong Replica continues to feel in the area and many people are trapped under the castles of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung, he hired to abandon his position at the Mutiara airport control tower Sis Al Jufri de Palu, which was violently balanced.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the exit track at the time, could be safely disbanded.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait stated that it is possible that this decision will allow hundreds of lives to be saved, reported to Australia's ABC News Channel.
We're preparing a Balikipan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We'll break our heart when we're buried," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death balance could be of thousands and the disaster management agency of the country said that access to the cities of Dothria, Sigi and Botong is limited.
"The balance of victims is believed to continue to increase due to the fact that there are many bodies under the cassettes and that many of them could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said.
The waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and visas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is carrying bodies.
The potable water's gone.
People are getting the minimum."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and communicated to the military in the country: "I ask everyone you work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
You're ready?" He informed CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year's earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a disappearance after a plane accident in a lake
The airline operating a flight that was starved in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a disappearance after the 47 passengers and crew had previously said that they would leave the plane that was sinking without incident.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since the afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working side by side with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Area ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash of the plane against the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
The authorities said the Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that they all found stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the events remains unclear.
Both the plane and the U.S. Army confirmed that the plane landed in the lake before reaching the landing track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has passed away on the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered very little.
"That's something extremely positive," commented Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and the other passengers were able to make progress between the water that reached the dock until the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the pilots were crying and scared, and that he suffered a mild wound in his head.
The U.S. Army indicated that seafarers working near the site in the repair tasks of a cave also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in plane accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but no one affected Air Niugini.
An analyst compiles the night's chronology in which a woman was burned alive
The tax was handed over to the trial on Saturday at the repeated trial of a man accused of smoking a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompile the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that demonstrated that Tellis was meeting Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous claims as reported by the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that his cell phone was in contact with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went down the street on the Sabbath and testified that the day was not found in the city that day.
When the tax office asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"The borone of his life," said Hale.
It is scheduled that the defence begins its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge showed that he was hoping that the judge would be brought to trial by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the hip hop conscious?
A third of hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception that he has the genre covering his music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that the hip hop has left its origins with political messages and struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get back to the fight hip hop again to be popular.
Artists such as The Refugees and Common have recently experienced a revolution in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York kid's guardian asks a couple after a "racist" message.
A carer from New York's children will ask a spouse for discrimination after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from the mother in which she complained she was "other black".
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her distress when she found out that Giselle Maurice was a black nurse when her first day of work was presented in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent Mrs Maurice twice.
After taking account of his mistake, a "inclined" Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice, saying that the carer who had just left, who was African, had done his job badly and was waiting for a Philippines according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid her work day and sent her home to Uber.
Now Maurice is going to ask the couple to get compensation for the damage and requires a compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired, although there was no medium-term contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done," said the Post the next day, adding "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that dismissing Maurice was the most reasonable thing, because they were afraid they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife will send you a message that she didn't intend to send.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they had offended, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plato declared that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are they going for such a person?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them by their conduct and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not be identified with a mouth talking as if they could end up in a new card
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented about the letter: "It's hard to put it into a person's skin for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who worked as a camera to the BBC before he was inspired to write the child book about a small playboy, would be optimistic about the possibility of rejecting his work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agridoce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was clearly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing to blame," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you're proud yet you didn't really do it to you.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was a creation of its own and product of its imagination, it always gave him all the merit to Paddington's own."
My daughter was dying and had to fire me through the phone.
After the quake, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nothing had been called with regularity to say that it was very bad, that it was not expected to survive.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and had to leave her.
And they did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors give you to keep your heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving your body.
She was dead a while ago, and now she's gone.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to take care of myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment of struggle for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noting the quarries she was suffering.
"No one has detected it," he said.
"He had his head down and fell low all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive sense of solidarity by Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Posts of women affected to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of the murder are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys carry cards in a gallery bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers to whom they can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he started to suffer depression, and he died at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel myself every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"All the world knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile was alame to any room."
However, he left his job before he died and was "no deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis commented: "I have continued concern that there is a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the people that there are people who can be heard and who can talk to, even though he is a friend.
Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"I didn't comment that he was sad or depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their attitude.
The day of Christmas had a background (when the children opened their bags, he had no visual contact with them or anything)".
He said his death was a tremendous tragedy for them, but they must overcome it: "The family has disappeared.
We're tired.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future holds a son while the FBI begins the investigation
"I thought, if we could get something like what I was asking (a limited time and limited area investigation), it is possible that we could get a little unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "lost" due to the parallelization of the parties.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his fellow Republican sympathies want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reticence is due to a matter of time.
If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to make the man they wish for at the country's maximum court.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to his horse, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently covers 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the patent and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is below Kim's mandate
The number of North Korea deserters destined for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean reader.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korea Unification Ministry, stated that 1.127 deserts will occur during the last year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the energizing of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the tariffs charged by the people responsible for crossing people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
To the great majority of the deserters of the North, they finally offered the state of South Korea.
More than 30,000 Norwegians have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most focus on China, which has the largest border crossing with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized area between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters illegal immigrants instead of refugees and often repatriate them compulsoryly.
The relations between the north and the south (which technically persist in war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-a member of Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will be first unilaterally disarmed," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it's not appropriate to access the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and made sure that he was not suitable for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman ever behaves like this, she would call her hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the Kavanaugh statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee the tears.
Kavanaugh emotionally charged the charges of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh showed very excited, at times almost crying and remaining talking while describing his family and the years of his institute.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democracies, cataloging the charges against him as "a murder of gross and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry by the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he was critical of the Democrats.
"I think it is incompatible with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked if he would try to force Kavanaugh if it was confirmed in the place and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is the following: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where it is currently found," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that could be adopted by Kavanaugh against the protection law for the patient and the care of accessible health or the case of Roe against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In terms of confirmation, Kavanaugh failed to raise questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be rejected.
"It's not the time for a historical person and with prejudice to access the court and still waiting for us to say, look well," said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
He's been dealing with a just-justified diaphragm, months and years of anger, and he can't get out without crying.
"We love when we get angry," commented Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so weird, do I?"
He continued: "I got a lot of help from a woman who was running somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that consisted of where, when she was angry and began to cry, she said to the person I was talking to: "The best thing you're thinking is that I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, he went on.
I look brilliant."
The tears are allowed as a valve to escape from the anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most intimate memories in one of my first jobs in a man-dominant office, where I began to cry with an impossible rage to describe, was that a larger woman approached me from the back of the neck, a distant higher who always caused me a fear of lightning, and led me to the edge of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was picked up on an adventure outside the marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not be considered the idea of presenting it to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I commented between rice 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the seven Ananos."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fund-raising, so he swore he wouldn't get in the race by the presidency unless he was able to earn $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of those who supported it would only contribute $1,000 to male candidates.
"What do you think, that I'm upset?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (with gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates and enthusiasm for existing sexism) that remained without words.
"You'd think it'd be a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press with her.
"You'd think Klenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what were they writing on my stone?

How trade war between the United States and China can have a positive effect on Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were devastating and, although the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale was produced this week with the application of new tariffs affecting a equivalent to $200 million, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Pekkin has constantly been attacked in the same way, the most recent rising rates of five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate the US measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be moved in the short term.
In order to get Washington back, it would be necessary to surrender to its demands, but to do so publicly before the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its letters correctly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could favour China for a long time by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions necessary to launch an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than it was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-based researcher for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "list" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods are now being met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from any of the countries supporting the lifting.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final marker from 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle that he had ever offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16th par. 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all its series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
The US Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the player with the worst rating of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first ranked in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against Ian Poulter, who is likely to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups discussed, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament winners, with 25.5 points.
"I'm not used to crying often, but today I can't avoid it.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to recover the cup.
The important thing is the team, and I am glad to be able to help," said an excited García after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the U.S. golfer Tiger Woods by 2&1 on the individual Sunday.
"The pride I feel today for being able to defeat Tiger Woods. I thought I was going to play that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four parties in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, 14 grand winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend so they wouldn't get out of the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a golf of high caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they were in trouble with the Europeans.
Let's fight.
I'll take the hat off before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, we'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to get the hat out.
It was higher."
