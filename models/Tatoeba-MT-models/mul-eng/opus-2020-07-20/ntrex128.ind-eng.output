Members of the Majelis (AM) Welsh are worried when they're 'blowing like muppets'.
There are concerns among some AMs about a suggestion that their term should be changed into MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament/ Member of Parliament).
This is because of the plan to change the name of Majelis into Parliament of Welsh.
The U.S. people in the entire political spectrum are worried if that could get a smile.
An A.M. working party said that his group was careful, "The moment was right with Twp and Pwp."
For readers out of Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirty.
A member of the police (AM) said that his group was one, feeling "not easy" and had suggested some alternatives.
A Conservative Welsh said his group "open thinking" about a change of name, but considered that it was a mistake from the MWP brief to Muppet.
In this context, the word “w ” in the Welsh language is rendered“ u in the English Yorkshire language. ”
The Majelis Commission has now proposed legislation to identify the change in the name, saying: "The final decision on any explanation of the amnesty is certainly a problem for the members themselves."
In 2017, the Wales government issued a decree that allowed Majelis Wales to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a proposal known as broad support to refer to the Ombudsman as Parliament of Welsh.
With regard to AM issues, the Commission prefers the WMPs (Wellsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but the MWP options receive the highest support in public consultation.
The U.S. seemed to offer alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could leave the chief, Elin Jones, who was expected to grant these changes in the century for a few weeks.
These reforms will include other changes in how the work is done, including the rules of disqualification for the Americans and the system of committees.
The U.S. will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the benefits.
The Macedonian society went to vote in the referendum on change in the name of the country
Speakers will determine whether their country's name will be changed to "Northern Macedonian Republic".
The so - called end was in an effort to settle disputes for a decade with a Greek neighbor, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north indicates a confession of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the offer of accession to the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a voter for a change of name, has said he will reject the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in name is the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
Longing-long St.Martin doesn't want to happen when the churches in Harlem are in trouble
"My parents have told me about a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there is no one."
He said that losing him all those bars could be mentioned.
"People socialize in other ways" now, he says.
"That it is no longer a community guest room where people visit it regularly."
Likewise with the church, he was worried that the money from the asset sales would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and they will be back soon or soon."
The churches, he added, could be replaced with an apartment building with a condomium filled with people who would not help care for the remaining sacred places around it.
"The majority of the people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why it's going to speed up the day where these churches are closed together because it's not possible that people who moved to the condominium will become members of these churches."
The second church was founded by a white congregation before Harlem became a black town of the Black American Community in 1870, and a decade later, St. Martin was born.
In the 1930 ’ s, the white Methodist congregation moved.
The black congregation that was once part of the country had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken by a black congregation under the leadership of Pope John Howard, who led an evictor boy on 125th Street, the main route to the Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The building was badly damaged in 1939, but when the people planned to rebuild the walls, they built a tower.
Lord David Johnson, son of the Prince Johnson, and his successor in St. Martin with pride called the delicacy "Loncing poor people"
One expert who hid the talent in July gave him another clue: "A cultural treasure" and "an unchanged historical instrument."
One scholar, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also notes that this is the first dance hall in the world played by black music, Dionysio A. Lind who changed to gathering the largest dance hall in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in Santo Martin in the last few months is a serious architect and contractor, some brought by public church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopal Council.
Vestry--the board of directors, formed by the public leaders -- wrote to the board in July with concern that the obstetrician "will try to pay" to the board, even though the Vestry is not involved in the architectural and contractors sent by the obstetrics.
Some people in the park need less transparency than others.
Hyu hurt 13 - year - olds in a labster experience in California
One dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on the Sabbath when he fell down to catch a labster in California during the opening of the lobby, an officer's funeral.
The attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been sleeping with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then hung up in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a pleasure to catch a lobster, but then he "discovered" that the boy shouted, "I'm hit!
I'm hit!'
All her bones are broken," Hammel said that she knew her when she had the baby.
And I cried unto all the people, that came out of the water, saying, There is a lion in the water.
The son was sent to the Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he was treated in a critical condition.
The hive species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Rescuer Larry Giles said in the media conference that a dog had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was classified as harmless dog species.
Gilles adds that the victim suffered a fatal injury on the part of his body.
The official closed access to the beach from the Pontai Bridge in Casablad to the Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 hive species in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
The Sciencesbury Project Breaks England’s Beauty Market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with kios-kios the beauty of creating a conservation that was dominated by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the British beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow during the sale of fashion products and household appliances, the larger kios-kios will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be grown to be more stores in the next few years if this proves to be successful.
Investing in the area of beauty becomes a challenge for the supermarkets to use the first rockets used as a TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Science says that it will greatly reduce the offer of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current mercenary range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more room with recyclable areas as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also reassessed the factory’s makeup so that most of its products would be ready for something that young drivers are interested in.
In addition, the perfumer Fragrance Shop will test the consensus in two Sainsbury stores, first opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year's end.
Online payments and changing the purchase of daily food needs in a small number of local retail stores mean that the supermarket has to do something more to attract people to attend.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sciencesbury, has said that the cures will become more like Mall when the supermarkets try to fight back predators such as Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more services and without food.
Sainsbury has placed Argos in hundreds of stores and has identified some Habitat cures since they bought the second rounds two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of food daily and made a more useful claim.
The former supermarket's surface to modernize the beauty department and the pharmaceuticals ended up with failure.
Sainsbury tried to work with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but work came to an end after there was an argument about how to share the profits of the chemical store in that supermarket.
A new strategy appeared after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical shops to Celesio, owner of the Loyds Farmer, £125 million, three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this article, adding various skin care centers below, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencesbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and taste of kios-kios beauty to improve the beauty for our destiny.
We also made investments to help train our Bible students to be ready to offer counsel.
We're designed so that we're in line with all the needs, the environment, and a safe place to act that we're now going to be targets against the way we've been."
Peter Jones 'gram' after Holly Willoughby drew himself out of a £11 million contract.
The Dragons Dan star, Peter Jones went "with the noise" after the Holly Willoughby TV show drew itself from a business deal worth £11 million to focus more on the new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to handle their wedding equipment and accessories, Truly.
This couple’s business is compared to the Goop market owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The organizer of this morning, 37 years old, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star."
The source says that Jones was so "gram" when the TV girl admitted during a meeting held on Sunday at her business center office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract - worth up to £1.5 million - means she doesn't have enough time to work on their wedding equipment and accessories, Truly.
Their business has been compared to the Goop market owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to spend $11 million on Willoughby.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used the Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says: "Truly this far is Holly's most important priority.
It's going to be the future of its longevity, which will make it endure for decades to come.
Her decision to give up all who were deeply involved in it was a personal one.
No one can believe what happened on the Sabbath, very close to the time of the Flood.
There's a lot of stuff in Marlow's main office that's ready to be sold."
Researchers believe that this morning, one of the most expensive stars in England, can destroy companies up to a million dollars due to large investments in product form, from flag and liline to household clothing and equipment, and have more potential for launch.
And this can mean the end of a long-term relationship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby set up with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones was appointed head of the Governing Body in March 2016.
This couple enjoyed recreation with Jones, who owned 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production.
Willoughby will be the master of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV player calling I'm A Celebrity.
A reporter close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously 'and then we fell in love'
He jokes about the criticism he will receive from the media because he makes comments that some people consider "not presidential" and has been very positive to North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said with a voice saying no "reading news" to his own.
"I didn't give anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting twice after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was commended by the Trump as a step forward in denoclinating North Korea.
But the negotiations between the nuclear power plant and the nuclear power plant have stopped.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat spoke to world leaders on the Sabbath that North Korea did not see "responsibility" from the United States for the beginning of North Korea's deployment of weapons.
Rather, he wrote that the United States continues to be a force for good.
The crowd is looking more optimistic in the series of discussions.
"We're doing the best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship had led to positive results in stopping rocket tests, helping free the army, and restoring the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he's protecting his uncomplicated commitment in talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this mess, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the audience that is right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and tsunami destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people
As a result of the Lombok campaign, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has lost their place of residence, there is no statement of national disaster, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, dear ones, they have explained that they do not ask for international help, so this is a little against," said Mrs. Somung.
While Save The Children are calling the team to go to the Palu, it's still not sure if foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo's father, speaking of the national disaster relief team, said that the Indonesian authorities were putting an end to the situation in Palu to see if foreign society was allowed to contribute to the aid.
Looking back on our long journey through Indonesia, the country is still in a state of deep distress.
While the Tsunami site was built in Acah, it was not a public sight on the other side of the sea.
There is no siren of the tsunami warning in the Palu, although the threat warning has been given, the great possibility has contributed to the survival of the victims.
At the best times, the journey between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Nature's plans make logistics even more complex.
A local hospital located in Lombok to care for the quake victims is heading to the Valley, but it will take at least three days to reach a new site.
President Joko Widodo has made an improvement in Indonesia's broken infrastructure as intended by the electoral campaign, and he has spent money on building roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds caused him to lose his balance as he was able to handle the next year’s election.
Joko’s father was also under pressure from the prevailing sectarians in Indonesia, where members of the majority of the Muslims held a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes when Muslim and Christian groups fought along the streets, using guns, buses, and guns, and other weapons.
Witnessing: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge intrudes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the defeat of Chelsea in the Premier League with one score in minutes to 89 on Saturday in Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received an invitation from Gerdan Shaqiri about 30 meters outside Chelsea when the team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before he showed it to the far side of the wall.
The ball hits high on the shoulder when the ball hits the right target on the network.
The ball finally fell across the Arrizabala that jumped and fell into the network.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it out as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just make an impression."
Chelsea led with score 1-0 in the first half after the original Belgian player Eden Hazard printed the ball in the mid-25s.
The Blue fighter gave Matthew Kovacic a chance to return to the game, before crossing the middle line and running fast to the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave way and ran in the middle line.
Then he made the perfect statement, leading to Hazard’s death.
Hazard managed to pass through the battle gates and lure the ball into the bottom of the ladder with the left-hand side of the foot, through the Liverpool’s Alison Becker.
Liverpool fought Napoli in the Liga Champion group camp on Wednesday evening at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe on Wednesday evenings in London.
The death toll from Indonesian tsunamis has increased to 832
The death toll on the earth and on the Indonesian tsunami had increased to 832 people — a total of over half the country’s population on Sunday mornings.
Many were reported to be trapped in the collapse of the earth’s atmosphere by 7.5 - scale Richter climbers on Friday and rocking up to 20 feet [2 m], said Sutopo Purwo, who spoke in public during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which lives more than 380,000 lives, is filled with fallen walls.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, for murder after a woman was arrested until she died.
The murder investigation was carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mercedes last morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 a.m. with a few broken wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked those around them to see or hear something from us.
Detective Brian O'Hagan says: "The investigation is still at first, but I'm asking everyone around John's street to see or hear something that's suspected of contacting us.
I also charge everyone, especially cab drivers, who might put something on the bus camera to contact us because they might have important information for our research.
The police interview confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
Tonight, friends who feel confident that they know the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Research continues, as the police have said, they're in the process of informing relatives who are close to the victim.
A cab driver who lived in Grayson Mays just came back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
That guy can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
Now the citizens are being told that they will need a few hours until they are allowed to come back.
A police officer heard someone telling him that all areas are now being treated as a scene of events.
A woman appeared on the scene in a crying situation.
He always said, "This is terrible."
On 2nd of the day, two vans of the police were on the line and the others were outside.
A number of officials stood in line to control the block of the apartment.
Anyone who has the information requested to send a message directly to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimstoppers anonymously on number 0800 555 111 by building log 247 on September 30th.
Parliament Cromwell's uncle became the last of the most popular 'recorded history' memorabilia
The invasion will be a punitive justice against the Al-Taliban destruction of many British cultural and cultural artifacts by the fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "a fool" and as "an attempt to re-writing history."
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, says: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate on the destruction of the walls, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster palace will become a curse.
The Anglo - American World Power was not commanded or controlled by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell’s offspring were to be sacrificed for the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the first century.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is a 19th-century theory and part of the history of a figure that is still believed to be worthy of service.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many people, perhaps more than at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary advocate against external pressure, in particular the state.
Whether it's a fully accurate representation, it's still a subject of further historical debate.
which must have been that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century had formed the next nation's development, and Cromwell was an individual who represented the same side of the difference.
His wealth as a protector is worthy of all praise and honour."
The Killer’s Famines Control the Chinese Plants to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a dog in a southern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, who was identified only with the name "Yuan", was found dying of the contaminated artery, bleeding near a pig's market in the Liupanshui province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A cow farmer is ready to assign a vaccine to a cow farmer on May 30, 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
She was reported to have left with her cousin from a nearby area of the Greek province of Kimas on the day of her sale of 15 chickens in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and he saw the dog's door next to him opened.
He said that there was a big snake in his mouth with blood in his mouth.
Forensics confirm that the weighted flesh of this 550-pound pig has tortured the fetus until death, on the basis of a report.
"I've got my blood and it's ruined," said the well-known poet "Wu," as directed by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera records show Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his fathers.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed that man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the dog had been tied up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the reported market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
In spite of the scale, cases of dog attacks against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016 a bull attacked a woman and her husband in their field in Massachusetts caused the wounded man.
Ten years ago, a dog with a weight of 650 pounds caught a Welsh farmer into his tractor until the woman was afraid and expelled that animal.
After a native of Oregon eaten by his grandfather in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that the cow was usually not aggressive but blood Roma could act as a "pemica".
"They're just playing games.
They're jealous, very curious to know... that they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's bazaar brings heavy rain to the west of the United States.
As you can imagine, Badai Rosa was weakened while moving on a colder beach in the north coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will cause water to flow throughout the region of northern Mexico and the United States in a few days.
Rosa has an air speed of 85 mph, Badai Category 1, starting at 5 o'clock in the morning. On Sunday the East Coast was located 385 miles west of Mount Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa probably moved north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Maulu began to form on the Pacific Samudera and moved east, towards the West Coast of the USA. As Rosa approached the end of the California Bay on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push the Tropical coast north to the west of the US.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches [10 cm] in part of Mexico City on Sunday.
Then, a tropical storm that has been submerged with an approaching hurricane would create a global downpour of rain in the Western Hemisphere for a few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 tons of rain will cause dangerous rivers of sand, sandy beaches, and the possibility of a long-distance land in the desert.
A mild tropical storm will cause a heavy downpour of between 2 and 3 degrees Fahrenheit [2 and 3 ° C] at some point, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Many 2 to 4 tons of rain are expected to fall in some parts of the Western world, especially in most of Arizona.
The ocean is likely to be affected by conditions that are rapidly deteriorating because of the spread of tropical rain.
Very unlikely to explore the desert by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains had caused the river to swell to flood stage.
The approaching storm will cause local floods on the south coast of California.
A total of over half an inch of rain would allow, which could cause small droplets to flow and the road would become a curse.
It's going to be the first rain in that region in their rain season.
A number of tropical rains are about to begin near Arizona at the end of Sunday and Sunday morning, before the rains become more widespread on Senin and Salasa.
The heavy rain would have covered the four horsemen on the Sabbath day and would have swept them to the limit.
In October some great changes will occur throughout the United States when the Arctic is colder, but the tropical area remains hot enough.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in the short distance.
There is an accurate example of the difference in temperature that is dramatic throughout the United States during the mid - afternoon period.
There are nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining heat will be milder and will return to the zealous field.
Most of the Central and Eastern regions of the USA are expected to start hot beginning in October with the speed to spread much of 80s from the South East to the East Sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Sunday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees on average.
Our long-term review of the climate shows a high chance of high temperatures on average for the East US until mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the story of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people have witnessed an interesting announcement on Thursday by the Grand Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing sexual violence that was expected to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continues, with the presence of publishers who hold regular meetings to report an unexpected event on Friday's last minute: a deal planned by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to do research for one week on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100% sure that Kavanaugh would tear her body apart in a state of drunkenness and try to wash her clothes at the High School.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
There may have been more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculates the interest rates in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The use of other networks that announce this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is often in trouble with the number of people who witnessed him at the office.
To put this in perspective, that's the number of hunters that almost match the playoff football match or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who believes the organizers are very supportive of Kavanaugh's target, won from all networks with 5.69 million mourners throughout the entire congregation, says Nielsen.
The ABC lives in second position with 3.26 million passengers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million passengers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the trial.
Flake was the key player in the Sunday drama.
After the Department of Modern Republic Party issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS on Friday morning by the director of the case when he tried to fly to the Court Committee.
He's standing down for a few minutes when he gets up, released directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "There's no power when there's a lot of women who can't do it."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he had to say in the committee congregation.
The cable TV and the radio network all crashed directly a couple of hours later, when the Justice Committee will choose to raise Kavanaugh to the entire Senate for a hearing.
But Flake says he's only gonna do it with understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the peasants for the next week, as the Democrats have asked.
Flake has been assured part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, as it is clear that the Republican party will not have a voice to agree with Kavanaugh without any research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister blames Brexit's criticism of 'political leaders'
Minister Theresa May's campaign condemned the "political play" criticism of Britain's future and undermined national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in a discussion with a Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May came to the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the talks that presented it in front of the press, the foreign minister Boris Johnson emphasised an attack on what he said as a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about England and the EU that should bring together the same tariffs was "not entirely reasonable."
Wyde Sims shooting: The police arrested the suspect of Dyteon Simpson in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shootout that caused the death of Wayde Sims, a 20 - year - old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and jailed with a second-level murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officers wrote video interviews between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eye during the battle.
The police found those glasses at the scene and said they found DNA Simpson on that stuff, the WAFB CBS office reported.
After Simpson questioned, the police said he admitted he had committed fatal attacks on Wade.
The contract was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Koroner Paroke Baton Rouge East wrote a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a head injury to the head to the neck.
The department appreciates the hard work of the Louisiana State Police Department, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the local community in helping research leading to arrests.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the regional lawmakers for "recognizing and seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With 6,6 feet in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Point-rate is 5.6 and climbs up to 2.6 in the past season.
On Friday morning, Lsu Will Wade's basketball coach said his team felt "damaged" and "fucked" with the death of Wade.
"That's what you've been worried about all the time," said Wade.
Mounting fire devours things in Mexico City
A mother coming out of a volcano named Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost part of Mexico City.
The National Banana Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the field and listed 183 gas and fuel emissions in the century for more than 24 hours.
The center was held several times and was divided.
Social media images show a typical picture of what hit the front of the car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase of 45 miles (72 km) to the south of the city’s capital since the 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
This Mount Berapi is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
The Bentrok police with the Catalan separatist interfered with the election ceremony.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a demonstration of pro-demanding concrete with anti-harass police, and when thousands of people joined a union demonstration to celebrate the first polling polling of Catalonia about self-determination.
A group of pro-separatist paralyses kept by anti-hara police broke them with a bullet and threw a bottle of lead, creating dark clouds in the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The investigation also took place after that day with the police who used their targets to control the investigation.
For a few hours, groups of pro-debt groups shouted, "Don't forget, no forgiveness" to meet with one of the workers who shouted, "Hidup Spanish."
Forty - four people received medical treatment for minor injuries found in the protest, and the local press reported.
A year after the October 1st referendum, Madrid was considered illegal but served by the Catalan separatist.
Although the number of voters is much smaller than the number of voters who are opposed to each other, the majority vote in favour of the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured a year ago after the police tried to stop the silence in the TPS throughout the region in an angry mob.
Pro-debt groups have spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in the ranks supporting the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it required a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, a electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer wished for the future of Catalonia.
"A year ago we had one of our best moments.
I testify to my parents crying because they can choose, but now we're stuck," she said.
Despite the success of the vital victory in the last few December regional elections, the pro-debt parties of the Catalans have fought to maintain this year's moment, even though many of their well-known leaders, who are in custody or in prison, are waiting for a debate, on their role in organizing referendums and on the declaration of freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who protested with his cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been blocked by the politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting harder," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned before the end of last year, announced that he will join the European Parliament's election next year.
"To stand as a candidate for Europe's election is the best way to threaten growth in the values of democracy and the persecution we have seen from the Spanish government," she said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry.
That incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on the day of Kimis about 19:30 B.C.E.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done at the gate and the building itself.
A bow might have been shot to the side of a car at some point.
The gold printed by Menga has given Livingston victory over Rangers with score 1-0.
First Gol Dolly Gong for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston’s victory over the Rangers led to the defeat of Steven Gerard from his office as director of the Ibrox Club, over the success of both of them in 18 contests.
The attack on Dolly Menga has proved to be a different thing when Gary Holt moved the side of the Himbernian that was on the second line.
Gerard's side remains unconquered in this Premiership period and faces eight Hearts leaders in front of them, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers had met Rapid Vienna in the European Union, on Thursday.
Livingston, during that time, extended the record that won't win them in the division to be six competitions, but Holt's coach's head has been cutting off the defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his chance to fight a cruel guest team.
The Holt team should've won a long time before they printed the gol, with the precision that they gave Rangers all the trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to cross the bridge but his efforts to cross the bridge, and then Alan Lithgow could only extend his work after he jumped in and faced the Craig Halkett fighter from across the bridge.
The owner of the house was pleased to let Rangers play the winning game at first, knowing that they could draw a team of arrivals on the event of the dead ball.
And that's how to produce a very important goal.
The rangers of free movement and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got the ring and print the gold from the middle of the field.
At that point, Rangers has dominating the government but realizes that the housekeeper's defense cannot be defeated and Liam Kelly's hat is completely uninterrupted,
The pool continued to grow until the second millennium, even though Alfredo Morelos managed to rescue Kelly.
Scott Pittman was chased by the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow’s champions, who were deeply affected by the tactical effects of another Livingston game.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's side and continued to retreat, while two violent clichés -- after Halkett's challenge to the actor Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball -- was rejected.
"Fenominal" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alaskar Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
It's perfect and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were extraordinary, continuing to hope for the continued voyage.
The way they play and the staff do not change much since they return to the deck, but they have to give Holt great credit for how he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He's got so many connections.
Captain Halkett is very great, leading a well-organized fight, while Menga makes Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall stay awake during the game.
Even so, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their final ball was less good than once they could break the formation of the owner’s side of the house and it became a reminder to Rangers, who recognized their status in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a warm welcome in Cologne.
There was a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO troops.
They are openly aware of the problems, including human rights and freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new big mask.
This city is the home of the largest Turkish population in the world.
The police mentioned security reasons for arresting 25,000 people gathered in front of the massacre, but many of the supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters -- many of them Kurdi -- also called out, threatened both the government of Erdogan and the German government's decision to accept him in the country.
Protes of the struggle depicts a dispute over the status of a guest who was considered a hero by some Turkish people and who was described as a dictator by others.
Deptford's train station: The train's dead in the car's lockdown
A driver died in a traffic accident involving a car in London.
It happened close to Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, many roads in Deptford, southwest of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car crash stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The arrest took place months after the other driver died in a run-in in Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the arrest on that Saturday.
The Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and tell his family.
The roads were closed and bus routes were carried out, and motorists were called on to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six wounded officers in the mines
Six crewmen were injured in a rape in a man's prison with a firm guard, the law firm said.
The riot took place in the HMP Long Westin prison in Worcestershire, about 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still continues.
Specialist "Tornado" has been forced to deal with this pollution, which involves eight prisoners and occurs on one side of the building.
Officers are being held at the scene because of the injuries they've suffered in the face.
A lawyer speaking in prison said: "The trainees who have been trained in particular have been forced to deal with the incident that is taking place in the HMP Long Westin prison.
Six officers have been taken care of because of injuries.
We don't mind the violence in this prison, and it's clear that the responsible officer will be given to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind the heavy charges."
The HMP Long Lardin prison has helped more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous prisoners.
In June it was reported that the head of the prison was taken to the hospital after an attack by a paramedic.
And in October last year, anti-harass officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious kidnapping where an officer was attacked by a billion-dollar ball.
Badai Rosa Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Bandang River
The tropical depression in Arizona is rare, but it's probably going to occur early next week because of the energy of the remaining Badai Rosa over the western realm, bringing about the risk of natural water.
The National Cua service has issued a warning of a flood on the days of Senin and Salasa for the West Arizona to the south Nevada, southern California and Utah, including cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was supposed to direct straight through Phoenix on Sunday, and she would stand at the sun in the rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix says on Twitter that there are only ten tropical peaks capable of causing tropical floods or depression in the 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a village within 40 miles of the U.S. border area."
The latest battalion war machine is capable of predicting 2 to 4 tons of rain with a total of 6 inches of terrisolation in Mogollon Rome Arizona.
Other western regions include the center of Rockies and the Great Basin, possibly between 1 and 2 inches, with the number of isolates reaching 4 inches.
For those in the free zone, Rosa’s rain forest may be a blessing because the area is under siege.
Although the river is a serious problem, some of this rain forest is likely to be of great benefit because the western region is now under siege.
According to A.S. U.S. Food Report, only about 40 percent of Arizona's area experienced a small amount of extreme hunger, the second highest category," weather.com reports.
First, the route across the Rosa Bay leads to the countryside across the California border to Mexico
Rosa, still in power on Sunday morning with a speed of 85 miles per hour [85 km / hr], 385 miles north of Mount Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at 12 miles per hour speed.
The caravan had passed through much of the Pacific Ocean, and it had to contend with its own strength.
That's why it's supposed to be crashing in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Senin in the evening or at night.
The storm may be high in parts of Mexico, creating high water risks
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected to cross the California Bay to the west of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical bazaar before reaching the Arizona border here on Saturday as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and to the South Utah on Wednesday night.
"The main risk that may be posed by the Rosa Bay or by its remnants is the high rainfall in the California Bay, the western region of Sonora, and the A.S. western region of the A.S." National Badai Centre (NHC) said.
It is thought that it will cause the threat of volcanic floods and volcanic eruptions that flow into the deserts, and it happens to be an avalanche in the mountainous region.
Midsumer Northon: Four arrests suspected of attempted murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a sudden injury in Somerset.
The young man was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsumer Norton area, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a stable condition.
A 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds, and a 20 - year - old man were arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, police.
Officers have charged anyone who might have the video of the event on his phone to come up to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh "receives anger and anger" from the Democratic Party.
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the cruel and humiliating part of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives anger and anger" from the Democratic Party during the campaign.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, with forcedly and emotionally denying a complaint from Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed sexual violence to him several decades ago when they were still young.
Ford also witnessed in the debate about his statement.
The president said on the Sabbath that "Americans saw the wisdom and qualities and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to identify someone who has the most perfect law-making mind in our time, a jury with a record of a true public servant," he said to a group of West Virginia supporters.
The president implied that Kavanaugh was referring to the mayor when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republic's people in the election campaign.
"Five weeks before it happened one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really crazy," she said.
"That's why I went there to come, fight for a great rabbit.
The team argues that Democrats are in the mission to "fight and block."
The first hearing procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh’s headquarters was expected to be carried out at least on Friday, a senior GOP assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by Indonesian tsunamis, tsunamis, with an increase in the number of victims.
A small number of 384 people were killed, many were injured when a violent storm hit the sea, when the earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival at the sea in Palu on Friday when a tower of six feet (18 m) struck the beach at noon, resulting in many deaths and destruction.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people still did their work at sea and did not run so quickly that they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB (BNPB) said at the time of defeat in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he drove a car, wood, house, beating everything in the country," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before crossing the coast.
A few people aboard a tree to save themselves from tsunamis and save lives, he said.
About 16,700 people were recruited to 24 service centers in the river.
The photos produced by BNPB show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, brick doors and bars, as well as a mask around the water.
And the wind blew the trumpet, and it blew a sound, and it blew a trumpet, so that the city might be destroyed on the Sabbath day.
The earth’s magnetic field, known as the earth’s magnetic field, is home to 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Institute (BPPT) says in a statement that the energy released on Friday’s mass explosion is about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb blasts dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographical location, which is at the end of a long dry winter, can grow to the size of the tsunami, can be said to be.
Nugroho describes the damage that has occurred as "extensive" and says thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The body of some victims was found trapped under the collapse of the building, he said, adding that there were 540 victims and 29 lost.
Nugroho said that victims and injuries could be even larger across the coast 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, a region called Dodhia, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication's really successful with lack of information from Donguria, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people who live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that members and volunteers are going to the most dangerous area.
"This is a tragedy, but this can be worse," she said.
The Institute on Saturday received a lot of criticism because it did not inform us that there was a tsunami that hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves were already hitting when the warning was issued.
A amateur video shared in social media shows a man on the floor on a building that is listening to panic warnings about the presence of a nearby tsunami, to the people on the streets below.
In a few minutes, the waves hit the beach, destroying buildings and cars.
Reuters can't prove this record's true immediately.
Fire and tsunamis are the greatest cause of electricity pollution that has resulted in communications around the river to persuade the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Soldiers have started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but refugees still need food and other wood needs.
The city of Udara has been reopened just to make an effort and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been assigned to visit the evacuation center in the Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami Indonesia's victim has risen to over 800.
That's terrible.
When World Vision officers from Dodrya arrived safely in Palu, where they were protected in the sandy sand dunes built on their offices, in their journey they had passed through a wide variety of lands, says Father Doseba.
"They told me they've seen many destroyed houses," she said.
It's terrible.
Even when the relief team began moving forward to begin the disaster prevention process, some of these groups allowed themselves to have reservations against skilled foreign volunteers, who were going to go to the Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, supplies, aid and power from abroad can only be begun if the affected area has been officially declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province level disaster," said Aulia Ariani, talking to the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but there is no such status."
And on the second night, there was a cloud and a tsunami in the valley, and friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of the marvels that will improve the story of the natural disaster.
On the Sabbath, a boy was taken out of the house.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman buried under the roof for two days along with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subannono, a trainee of the Indonesian national team, has been trained by two lost pilot athletes, who are quick to follow the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Those who were still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Father Mandi, were his disciples.
"As a senior in the field of entertainment, I have a personal emotional burden," she said.
Gendon told us again how after news of the ruined Roa-Roa Hotel moved around the coastal community, he finally sent a message of WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who came and went to the festival on that beach.
However, all of its messages, have only one sign, not two blue-colored.
"I think it means an unsent message," he said.
The speaker took $26,750 during the ATM raid at Newport, Level.
On Friday morning, the speaker stole $26,750 from a Brink official who was filling up the ATM machine storage box in Newport, on the basis of a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver's car's jammed an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to send more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was working, another man ran away from Brink's back and stole a bag of money that was going to be sent.
The Witness saw some who were suspected of running away from the scene, based on the news, but the police did not mention the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about their identity can contact Newport police in 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: This rapper changed his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yes.
Collecting that name over Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The first formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been bearing the name Ye for a while and uses that name as the eighth album title, written in June.
That change was made before the show on Saturday Night Live, when he was supposed to write his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande to show on the show, which was canceled because of the "emotional reason," said the show's creator.
As a brief description of his professional name now, West said that for him the word had a religious significance.
"I believe 'yes' is the word commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of the album with Radio Big Boy.
"My name is you, I am us, it's us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Yes as a mirror of our good, our evils, our delusions, everything.
The album is more like our real self-reliance."
He's one of the rapper numbers that changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
The remaining West co-laborator, JAY-Z, also made it with or without a link sign and great letters.
President of Mexico, AMLO, swears not to use military force in the face of civil society
Chosen President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he would never use military power against civil society violating the 50 years of bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "no military force will ever be used to force the Mexicans."
The army destroyed the peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the left-wing students raised their horns throughout the Latin America area.
Lopez Obrador has guaranteed support for young people in Mexico by providing monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free universities.
He said that leadership and at least the educational opportunities motivate young people to form criminal gangs.
A.S. should break A.I.'s orders.
As China is more active in the field of engineering, A.S. should reduce the number of funds to be used for research in that area, the words of the investor and the A2 Kai-Fu Lee practice, already working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the A.S. government made announcements about A.A., even when A.S. overall lack of formal A.A. strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its last year’s plan: to become number 1 in the AI innovation in 2030.
"Sustaining the AI research is a good start, remembering all the other countries remaining far away from the A.S., and we're looking for its next defence in the AI field," said Lee.
Depression could slow down the opportunity so that the next major AI will be held in the A.S., Lee told the CNBC in a conversation this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order", has been published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that won the best Othello American player, and then he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch of China.
Lee admits the former U.S. government technology struggle, such as the Robotics Challenge for the R & D Project and asks when the next action will be carried out, to help identify the next visioner.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win a gift from the Governor, Lee says.
"It's not China that took the academic leadership; it's the company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been working out of universities for AI research in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration trends can also help the A.S. to support the short-term efforts of the A.I.
"I think the white card can be offered automatically to the PHD holder in the AI field," he said.
In July 2017, the National Park of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Art.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences provides funds for people in academic institutions, such as the University of Alam and other government organizations that share money with the A.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
In early this year in the U.S. Department of Defence has developed the Joint Research Centre, which aims to involve industry and academies, and the White House has announced the formation of a Committee of Experts.
And this month DARPA (DARPA) announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
Because for the NSF, recently DARPA invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the A.S. legislation that requires the establishment of the National Commission for Skills has not seen progress for months.
The Macedonians made a vote in the country's change of name
The Macedonian Republic made a vote on Sunday to decide to change the country's name to "Northern Macedonian Republic", an action that will settle disputes for a decade with Greece that has blocked its offer of accession to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of the neighbouring country represents ownership of its territory and has banned its association with NATO and the European Union.
Both government authorities reached agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would undermine the identity of the majority of the ethnic population of Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the results of this election could reach the minimum number of 50 per cent of the votes needed to make the election a statement.
The question in the voice was, "Do you agree with NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Support for the change in names, including Minister Zoran Zaev's War, argues that it is appropriate to pay for admission into the body such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live free under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although they are not legally recognized, a large number of parliamentarians say that they will obey the voice of a decision.
Names have been changed.
The National Election Commission says there's no record of crimes until 1 Sunday.
However, the result of the vote was that only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the voters in the list gave their votes.
"I came to give my voice for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an electorate in the capital city, Skopje.
The Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and his son Dushko, wrote their voices for the general election in Macedonia in a series of amendments to the country's name that will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Struca, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, has prepared a small platform and attracted courses in front of the teams that are going to record the closing of the voice.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join respectfully, not through the servant door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a marriage.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Minister Zaev's statement that NATO's invasion will bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most people will accept it because more than 80 percent of our societies support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voice.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirming our future."
An opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Research on Sunday last year said that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would take part in the polling of the voices would be less than the number needed.
Other comments, published by Telma Macedonia TV station, found 57 percent of the respondents who were planning to continue to give their voices on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they'd choose.
In order to succeed, 50 percent of the volume will be added to the volume.
A failure in the vote will represent the first vote against the pro-Barat government since it took place in May last year.
Witnessing: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City studied the Bible with the goal of printing to a large extent.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were attacked as the Bridgeton battle in Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero makes it look so easy on his score at 65 minutes.
Argentina’s attacker received an opera in the middle of the field at the beginning of the contest.
He ran between three defenses Brighton before entering the open field.
Aguro later discovered that he was surrounded by four people who were making a lot of fun of him.
He drove through one of the defenses before running out of several other combatants at the end of Brighton.
Then he went to the left, to Sterling.
The front row of England used its first round-the-clock approach to take the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to win the bridge Brighton, Matthew Ryan with a view to the side of the ladder.
"Aguero fights with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola manager City to the reporter.
"We talked about herself playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's printing a ball at that time."
But Sterling's the first one to get Sky Blues in the Premier League war.
It happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted a ball, far away from Brighton in the game.
She wears a ball with a long, long - range view of her head through her left shoulder to the Leroy Sane.
You're gonna do a little bit of a ball before taking Sterling to the post office.
Sky Blue forwards guide the ball to the right side of the ball just before that ball jumps out of the border.

Scherzer wants to run a spy version of Rockies
By eliminating the Nationals from the playoff game, there is no reason to force another match.
But Scherzer, who's too competitive, hopes to be able to buy Colorado Rockies at the game on Sunday, but only if there's still an improvisation of the playoff for Rockies, which won in one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
At least Rockies didn't get a place after winning a wild-card match against the Nationals with score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division class.
"Although we play without winning, at least we can't find out what's going to happen in this denver with a audience of viewers and other teams that will compete at the highest level than any point I might have this year.
How could I not compete in such a competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the opening match for Sunday, but it is reported that in such a situation, they intend to let Scherzer go to the match.
Scherzer, who's going to start smoking for 34 times, has a training session on Thursday and starts a game on Sunday that is usually used for rest.

Tromp campaign in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to the situation following the election of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the public voice of the Republicans in the middle of the election.
"All the efforts we have made have been wasted in November.
Five weeks before he made the most important choice in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not really running it that's why I fight everywhere for a great candidate," she said.
The trumpet continues, "You see the existence of a very scary radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they decided to take power back in any way, you see their wickedness, their trials.
They have no interest in who they are, nor do they have any authority over whom they will. That is what they want. We will not give them any.
Democrats, he says, are in the mission to "reject and block."
"And you see it for the last four days," he said, referring to the Democrats as "bad and evil and cruel and cannot be trusted."
He referred to the Senate of Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Senate Justice Committee by calling it his name, which was received by a severe trial from his listeners.
"Do you remember the answer?
Have you broken that document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for it--it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Work House is no longer a public service place.
Now behave intelligible to anyone who makes his mind up.
When Momentum activation at my local party gave me a voice to threaten myself, that was not surprising.
Moreover, I was in the final sequence of Parliamentary Members, who were told that our presence was not expected because we shared opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan had a similar attitude because he strongly defended antisemitism.
In my case, the move of that crime is critical of me because it's not compatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic governance, in national security, in Europe, the ironic issue that Jeremy Corbyn had faced with earlier leaders.
The announcement to the meeting of the workers in Eastern Nottingham on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday was just like that.
Unfortunately today, the quality of many meetings and promises about politics that's "better, more comfortable" has not been forgotten for a long time, if it's, it's already started.
The difference between opinions on the part of a workmate is clearly not tolerated and each opinion is valued by the party’s authority.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, as my former colleague thought it would be possible to share the same political view, beginning to expect me to turn around and accept the position I would never have welcomed before -- good in national security and the single market of Europe.
Whenever I speak openly and ignore whatever I say then - after that there will be a social media survey that asks for a divorce, a central policy, to tell me that I should not join the Mountain Party.
And it's not just me who did it.
Of course, I know that I am happier compared with some of my colleagues because of the comments I received from the politicians.
I enjoy professionalism and the limitations of my peers who face sexual harassment or racism every day but who never gave up.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the political era today is how much abuse has been considered common.
Jeremy Corbyn complained last week that the Party should help to develop tolerance culture.
The fact is that we are no longer in a larger church and with each "untrustable" museum or changing the selection of party rules to be more restrictive.
I've got a lot of advice for the last two years that motivates me to keep my head down, not too loud, and then I'll say, "OK."
But I was drawn into politics not to do that.
Since I had been in the 32 years since I was still a school student, frustrated by the government propaganda of Thatcher that had influenced my class of understanding, I have tried to discuss better public service for those who really need it as a local consular or a minister in the government.
I have never been in a position to hide my political activities, including my final election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my position and things I don't agree with in the leadership right now.
To those who promote the museum on Friday, which I can say is that when the country moves fast towards the collapse of the state (Brexit), it will endanger our country's business and public service, I do not want to waste time and energy for the leaders of the party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, whether or not I'm a member of the Mountain Party.

Day 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered flight to position above
The last two tests may have been a little overdue, but no doubt Ayr has the right to win the Tennt's Premiership race that is very comforting today.
Now they're on the street, the only side won't win from ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, as well as their ability to provide the best, gave Peter Murchie the right to feel comfortable with the housekeeper and the trainer.
"We've been trying our game so far, and we're still not defeated so we feel happy," she said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "Thanks to Ayr, they're better off taking the chance than we did."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a kung fu card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given that game by Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to print the number and Jason Baggot to round up an unconverted test.
Climo extended the leadership of Ayr with a sticker, before, right in the middle of the time, he printed the ball and then made a single attempt to make Ayr score 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the second round with a good middle and Patrick Anderson's experiment, changed by Baggot, reduced the chances to five points.
And there's a long hole because Ruardhi Knott suffered serious injury, dropped out, and as soon as he started his return to the game, Ayr went faster than his attempt to try Stafford McDowell, changed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson later received a gold card and again, Melrose made a bidder to pay Bruce Colvine's unchanged experiment, at the end of the heavy pressure.
The owner of the house has returned to play, but, when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card because he hit the Climo without a ball, from the line of training, MacPherson came behind Ayr's injured progress.
The climate changed, as was the case again, almost since the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a bid and challenged Gregor Henry's fifth attempt.
The Still Game star appears ready to run his new career in the restaurant industry.
The Still Game Kieran star appears ready to move to the service industry after it was previously known that he was called a director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56 - year - old Jack Jarvis was executed at a BBC popular event, which he also attended with his former Communist associates, Greg Hemphil.
The couple have announced that the serial to nine that will come is the last episode, and Kiernan's face is planning to drive the radio right after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he was Director of the Affômorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun resource indicated that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by the countryside, hopes that justice will reopen the path to the Pacific.
The sea patrols in the large forest range located in La Paz.
The public building put a blue flag on it.
The Titicaca Ocean border to Amazon is interpolated with the motorcycle: "The sea is our right to the sea.
To get back is a duty."
During a 19th - century bloody conflict in the Pacific Ocean, the memories of a coastal crossing of Bolivia’s countryside are still vivid as the desire to resurface the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its peak in a few decades, as Bolivia was waiting for the closure of the court on October 1 after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian people who will watch ICJ on a wide range of roads throughout the country hope that justice in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s claim that - after a few decades of thought - Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's private president, who has been embroiled in a controversial war for the next year's re-election -- also has a lot of support in the case of the Sun.
"We are very close to the restoration of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court can't determine Bolivia's wishes, and that would only change a little if it allowed.
The PBB-based bodies have no power to provide the Chilean area, and it has been determined that it will not determine the outcome of the possibility of thinking.
That ICJ's arrest came only six months after the final argument was heard, which indicated the case "not complex," said Paz Zárate, an international lawyer in Chile.
And still far away from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years, maybe it's just a revolution.
"The problem of access to the sea has now been brought to the attention of the Bolivian government," he said.
The aggressive retort of Morales has weakened the mark of the remaining Chileans, he says.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to think at a certain point, but it will be very difficult to keep discussing after this.
Since 1962, both countries have not been united as one world power.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of the Bolivian government of Den Haag, went to the decision-making process immediately.
Sunday will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end of 139 years of debate with profit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales was one of the most famous Latin presidents who used Maritim issues as a political support.
Bolivia will never release its right to have access to the Pacific Sea," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see what we need to end the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons are not going to happen unless they can trust the U.S.
South Korea's Prime Minister Lear Ri Yong Ho said the first country would never break nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on the Sabbath at the time of the General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States had concluded an agreement at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of each other.
His comment appeared when the Secretary of State a.S. Mike Pompeo appeared nearly to begin a nuclear diplomacy that had been on the run for more than three months after meeting Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says only a "smell dream" that by continuing the Sanctions and the A.S. attack on the declaration of the solution to the Korean War would make North Korea give up.
Washington was careful to accept the declaration without Pyongyang who made an effort to eliminate the armed forces first.
All right, Kim and President A.S. Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there are doubts that Pyongyang is really about the recognition of the armed forces for the country as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Show Paris fashion shows many more recent collections of heads up to the main road near you
If you want to increase topi collection or really want to protect from sunlight don't look for another one.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne issued a series of large-scale headlines for their SS19 collection at the fashion show in Paris Fashion Week.
The really unethical topic has been packed with Instagram in this hot season and these designers have shown the creation of eye-browsing at the edge of the stage.
What comes from Valentino is a cream hat on it covered with a wide strip of cloth covering the head of the model.
Large-scale axesoris include the so - called magic hats and even a crime, but they are not made to crush the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of strangely-fashioned giants surrounding Halloween.
Many colored balls are drawn and the likeness of Hannibal Lecter is compared to the leather coat.
A creature that resembles a nest’s covering is equipped with snorkels and eyeglasses, while the other is seen as falling ice cream.
And if you continue to explore the collection of this advanced mode--you're going to be successful.
Mode monitors assume that this big top collection will be based on the main road near you.
Large-scale peaks become a very wide train in 'La Bomba', a two-footed top with a wide range of legs is seen using all the people including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The promotion of the label back to a very unheard of social media makes a big creation in the catwalk-toss of the sea from a large beach almost the same thing as dancing - used with a flat model.

John Edward: Language skills are very important to people worldwide
Scotland's Secret School maintained a record of academic independence, which was continued in 2018 with outstanding results, which was strengthened by each student and collective success in sports, art, music, and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Swasta School of Scotland (SCIS) are working hard to provide the best services for students and the elderly.
Schools are designed to equip students for further and higher education, for example, in their chosen career, and for their role as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that is able to adapt and implement school curriculums according to expected expectations, we have seen the modern language continue to be the focus of popular education and the desire for higher education in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, your words will enter his head.
If you speak to him in his speech, then your words will enter his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships and beliefs with people from other countries.
From the latest test this year, we can see that language is the top level of the league table with the highest score in high school.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received the value of A Plus.
This data was collected from 74 SCIS members who showed that 72 percent of students received A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent who studied Spanish also received A.
This shows that boarding schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will certainly need in the future.
Now languages, as educational choices, are in the same standard as STEM students' eyes (scientific, technology, management and mathematics) in modern schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour and English Training found that for a few reasons employers had to keep fighting, 17 percent because of the lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more language skills are encouraged to prepare young ones for their future careers.
As the number of hours we spent on the ministry increased, so did our ability to speak.
Whatever the choice of a person's career, if they're already learning a second language, in the future they're going to feel real good because they have all this life skills.
It is possible to communicate directly with people from foreign countries who will automatically make a multilingual winner in competition.
According to YouGov’s opinion of more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak French and become the only language spoken in two percentages, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children now is important for the moment.
Having multilingual skills, especially national languages with a growing economy, will provide children with a better opportunity to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in England for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your children’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected at school alone, with a qualified teacher staff in this field.
Schools in Scotland are designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be concluded that now, in the global business environment, language will always be an important part of determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must really be considered as "the training of international communication."
The school itself will continue to offer choices, opportunities, and challenges to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.

LeBron's going to go through the dance for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The hopes of the fans to see LeBron James begin his debut for Los Angeles Lakers almost finished.
Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of the Sunday season against dinner Nuggets in San Diego.
However, he had not yet decided how many minutes he would play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweets that James might be playing in just a few minutes.
After this week's training, James was asked about his plan for the sixth season of Lakers.
"At the level of my career right now, I don't have to do the game before the season to be ready," she said.
General Trup Rape Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public interview tonight at Wheeling, Virginia Barat.
This is the first general summit of the five general summits scheduled for the next week, including stopping in some pleasant places involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was stressed that the voter was ordered to be elected by the Supreme Court office, Trump meant to build support for him for a general election due to the risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was taken in November.
How many of the general Trumps in West Virginia tonight and how can you look in depth?
The general summit at Wheeling, West Virginia, was held on 7th of the night. It was Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view the general Trump in West Virginia as closely as possible by means of a direct video on YouTube.
It is possible that Trump will discuss this week’s congregation for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has become increasingly involved in sexual misconduct and the opinion of the Senate’s vote will be postponed until one week while the FBI is investigating it.
However, the main objective of this public agenda was to help the Republicans to get a few moments out of the November elections.
As a result, President Trump's campaign said that five general meetings in the coming week were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because the Republican parties tried to protect and expand the majority they held in Senate and DPR," Reuters said.
"The control of the Congress is so important for its agenda that the president may travel as much as possible to the countries of the region as we face the busy campaign period," said the trumpeter campaign who refused to mention his name to Reuters.
Called Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's general meeting is expected to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attracting the media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second trip to West Virginia will take place in the last month, the country she visited with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, candidate for West Virginia Senate from the Republic Party who is left in the state of mind.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to improve his experience in terms of opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US's courageous team keeps her hope in the face of Sunday's match
After three sessions one-side, foursome Saturday evening session is probably needed in this Ryder Cup.
The idea of a moment’s pause is the concept of a sport that is the product of an event that is fully believed by the players, and nothing is more than a competition like this.
What do they think is the moment?
"Before, they won six points and now four, so I think we think it's a little bit of a moment," recalled Jordan Spieth last day.
Europe certainly has benefits because it has four points with two points of play again.
But the American team, like Spieth said, felt that they had a little moment and they had a lot of things that could be excited, except the formation of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played with each other all day and each raised three of the four points.
Speeth has played a series of deaths from tee areas to green areas and led with enthusiasm.
The horrors of the hero's celebration grew stronger when his turn came, making an important score to make a series of competitions when he and Thomas lost two battles.
The kidnappings of him that won them at the 15th number that were received with a similar appeal, the appeal that gave you the idea that he was sure America was not lost.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players have left now.
18 holes needed to be fixed.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unforgettable story from Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe are four to four and can do without mistake.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't do bogey on Saturday evening, but they were also avoided from bogey on Saturday morning, Friday evening and back inne on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to go well to both of this huge crowd that convinces them that they are the players that should be defeated on Sunday, and no known players from Fleetwood and Molinari will shut down Europe's chances of winning in the winter over Le Golf National.
It's better if the two of them are located in different halls.
Still, the success of Europe remains too much for him to talk about.
Bugwa Watson and Webb Simpson promoted Sergio Garcia, a fire fighter in the morning when she was shot by Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the Nine front like looking for a hole that this Spanish and Swedish golf player will never be able to draw.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of hell.
Fourballs and foursomes are a good show to be seen closer by interaction between couples, the advice they offer, the advice they do not give and how the strategy can change sometimes.
At the same time, Europe played better as a team and led quite a long way to the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team had a chance to compete despite some doubt, especially in the United States.
Europe won 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit on the final day of Ryder Cup after rise from the fourball and foursome game on Saturday by directing 10-6 on the United States.
Two inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had to write their points this far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to keep the trophi that was not readily available in Hazeltine two years ago, dominating the American team that was wrong in the morning's fourballs, making this series 3-1.
The United States has won more than two games, but they have not been able to win the battle.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 each Sunday's competition to protect the trophi.
Fleetwood is the first European debut that won four rounds, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the end of the sentimental city, only become a second couple who won four points from their four openings in the Ryder Cup.
After defeating the Woods and Patrick Reed in their four-balls, they became very strong to defeat the Woods that swept away and the American bryson Dechambeau demo more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturdays, once showed up but he had lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven rounds.
Justin Rose, rest in the morning, and then go back home to share with Henrik Stanson in his foursom and lose 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - one and three worlds.
Europe did not reach it itself, even though it was the day it was enjoying and traveling to the west of Paris.
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set off for America with two points on Saturday.
They got 2&1 winnings that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourballs and then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two Holes.
It just happened twice in the history of Ryder Cup where a team came back from a four-point defiction to a single game, even though as a stand-up team for Furyk only needed a series of points to protect the trophi.
However, after two days of fighting, it seemed that the attack would be the best time to strike.
North Korea says 'it's impossible' to pull weapons apart without trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister presented to the PBB about continuing to deepen their distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that the country would break down its nuclear weapons separately in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of this world's body that North Korea has taken "significant steps that show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, disrupting nuclear testing sites, and promises not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any proper attitude from the United States," he said.
"Without belief in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such situations we will not be able to tear our own weapons apart."
While Ri returned the same amount from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "prepared" detentions where North Korea would be punished for taking a step forward, he said that they did not reject as much as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between the US President and North Korean leaders this time in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to "incorporate Korea's completion" while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea has officially wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to sign an international visa in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "the first integration" and increases the pressure with the sacred gift to achieve their goal firmly, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The assumption that sanctions can make us faint is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that it will continue to deepen our disbelief."
Ri didn't mention an article for a second summit between Kim and the U.S. leader in the United States this week.
The minister even attended three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the poor party in this denocency is South Korea and not the United States, the total decollation of Korea will not find such a way."
However, no dramaticly different from last year's, when he spoke to the General Assembly of the United States that restricting North Korea's rocket in the United States was something that could not be avoided after "Mr. President Devils" Trump called Kim "man of the rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at the PBB meeting, the last year's group threatened to "break up" North Korea in total, commending Kim for her courage to take steps to wipe it out, but that big work still has to be done and sanctions must be done until North Korea makes a deunclination.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it's okay," he said.
Tingkok and Russia believe that the PBP must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told the U.S. Security Council on Wednesday that "the Sanctions of the Security Council must be carried on firmly and not fail until we know that full, final and verification decollation is complete."
The Security Council with a short vote has increased the Sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt the development of the Pyongyang nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the General Assembly Hall of the PBB and said after that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has been visiting North Korea three times this time, but his final trip is not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July when he said that there really had been progress, only North Korea in an hour had realized that he was making a "question like a gangster."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to break down the missile position and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "the right action."
He said that Kim told him to do "the right thing" with his wish was security that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard University took a course on enough rest
A new class at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students sleep there more, trying to fight macho culture in a study that is developing through the 'humans of ghosts' in caffeine.
One academic found that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if they discuss a very basic matter about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep health specialization at Harvard Medical School and specialists at Brigham and Women's Hospital, design a course, which he was sure was the first of the kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a lesson about sleepless nights at school.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I get first to know now, in my last year?'
The girl said no one ever told me how important it was to sleep-- which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course that was laid out first this year explained to the students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic success, and to improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who had very low sleep rates throughout the week.
The course involved a series of interactive tasks for one hour.
In one session there was a picture of an assroom room, where students click on a cup of coffee, tea, sports pans, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results are affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of routineity during sleep.
On the other hand, researchers have found information about how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then motivates the audience to think about their day routine.
'We know this won't change the study behavior immediately.
But we're sure they have the right to know-- like you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke in health,' said Prof. Czeisler.
A culture of pride with 'beginning' still exists, it adds, that modern technology and pressures that continue to increase in students that mean sleeplessness are a problem that keeps growing.
To make sure you sleep well, with good quality, must be 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and fatigue, it's cold - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate the hunger mode, causing the feeling to go hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old California student of chemistry and physics that helped Professor Czeisler to develop this course, took one of his classes a year ago in Harvard for the first year.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire campus.
Next, she hoped that all her senior students would be instructed to complete the study program as soon as possible before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students consider setting up a bedtime alarm, also a wake-up alarm, and recognizing the effect of the 'white test' that is broadcast by electronic lights and LED lights, which can trigger your random rate of departure from the schedule to cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol To lower the mind of Gerrard
Meanwhile, Rangers felt the sadness of the day when the Dolly Menga attack was transferred to the Steven Gerrard divorced team at 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team tried to record their first victory on their journey, since the 4-1 victory in February in St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team just gave Gerard a second victory in 18 games as manager, causing the team to lose eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class leader.
To attack seven minutes before the first game is over and the missing Rangers players don't seem to be worth it.
While Rangers now descends into the sixth position, Livingston goes to the third position, just left the gold line from the Hibernian.
And maybe there'll be more problems in the Rangers tower after the Calum Spence linekeeper has to be cared for because of the head injuries after an object is thrown away from the distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the Ayr team to the Betfred Cup seminary.
Instead, Holt went with Livi 11 the same thing that took one point from Hearts last week and he'll be happy with the costume that meets their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may be domineering the possession of balls, but Livingston uses the balls they own better.
They should've written a score in just two minutes when the first short meal was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's belt, but the delay attracted the big opportunity too wide.
The free sight of the Jacobs House inside met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only enter the range in the background.
Rangers take control, but there seems to be more hope than confidence in their third game.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should get a lawyer when he and Steven Lawless stepped on the sign at an hour but the prisoner Steven Thomson rejected the flag of this Colombian state.
Rangers were able to do only two shots in the first row, but former Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, never had any problems with Lassana Coulibaly’s head and Ovie Ejaria’s simple attack.
Although the turn of Livi's opening at the 34th minute may be against his way of competition, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their hard work themselves.
Once again, Rangers failed to cope with the tactical death of the deep Jacobs ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put a ball in Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted on a break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change in shape gave an immediate effect when the player put the ball in Morelos but Kelly who was quick to jump out of the line to stand.
But Livingston continued to urge the team to play the exact game that they enjoyed, with Lithgov and Halkett playing all the long games.
The Holt team should have extended their tension at the final stage, but McGregor stood up to beat Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the shell.
Player Rangers, Glenn Middleton, complains about the attacker again when he leaves with Jacobs, but again Thomson turns his face.
Almanac: Geiger Reading Head
And now from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and MASIH AGAIN THE TERUS BERTAMBAH... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and justifying radioactivity, which was a discovery that eventually made the device known as Geiger's.
Being a science-based tool since then, the Geigers have also become the pop culture center, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," which appears to be less convincing by cobo scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger reading, used to find a radioactive location, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effect of the atom released by radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans said, "Tell me, it must be moving now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery of that name remained a mystery.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' evil cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "know" evil cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them into the laboratory
Then they can't get to know the common protein on many cancers and then they're re-injected.
A test vaccine shows the results of promising patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was treated with this vaccine, that is, teaching the immune system to identify the evil cell, her ovarian cancer was lost for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the immune cells, transforming them into the laboratory so that they can "know" the protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then withdraw that cell again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer League in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increasing the growth of some types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovary, paru-paru, and colorectal, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
The same approach as receiving immune cells and "instructing" them how to control cancer cells has succeeded in treating a type of leukemia.

Kanye West was interviewed at a studio during Saturday Night Live after the crash where she praised the president of the United States Donald Trump and said she would be hanging out in 2020.
After he took the third night's song, called Ghost Town, where he wore the Mac American Great hat, opposed the Democratic Party and returned his support for Trump.
"I used to talk to white people and they said, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began to show a survey by Matt Damon where Hollywood starboarding witnessed Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's Jewish Senate Committee on sexual violence against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not published, these Western archipelago records have been placed on social media by Communist Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to rock the West with that trap.
In addition, the West appealed to the viewers that he had a problem in the back of the hill because of the ceiling used.
"They buried me in the back of the hill.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They surrounded me!
And then they say I'm in the middle," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
"Do you want to see a dark place?" said he would wear Superman's hair, because that means you can't figure out what I'm supposed to do.
Try to love."
His comment produced at least twice a call from viewers and SNL shows shame, Variety reported, with one person saying, "All studios are boring."
West was brought to the last moments as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, the old rap singer Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses many people with the appearance of the song I Love it, dressed like the Perrier Bottle.
The West received support from the head of the TPSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote tweet: "Get one of the bravest souls: THETERIMA SHOULD BE DELIVERED."
But the actor Karen Hunter wrote a tweet that the West was just "to become himself and it was really great."
"But I chose for TIDAK to have someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his "years") that I believe in speaking and combating dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow the path of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
Along with rapist Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dog got the name Snoop Lion and certainly rejected Prince's legend, changing his name into a symbol and then an artist who was previously known as Prince.

Stargat Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticises sick masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the series of violent mid-century fantasy from the HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, waiting for the macho hero's stereotype, says that role on that kind of line makes boys often feel they need to be strong to be respected.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he's sure 'there' and asks how to deal with the bad masculinity problem in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his opponent at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he felt 'hard enough' to discuss that issue.
'I feel personally, quite strong, right now -- where are we wrong in this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculinity with its very masculinity characters.
He continued: "What is the character from birth, and what does it teach?
What does TV, and on the street, make boys feel they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one big question right now -- how do we change it?
'Cause obviously there's something wrong with the young ones.'
In that interview, he also admitted that he would not play in the prequal or secondary Game of Thrones when this series would end the summer coming, saying that he was 'completed with war and horses'.
Since November, Kit will re-examine her True West from Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and her brother, who was a poet.
The new actor revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to leave Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this exhibition, so I gave my family a future, and from here my life began' she said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the flower of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasies of this Emmy's appreciation winner.
This couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Tiongkok reports 14% of the new case length
Tingkok has announced 14 percent of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are displaced in this country, health officials say.
Almost 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The new majority of cases were reported through sex, reporting changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through several parts of Tingkok as a result of the transmission of viral blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, according to a conference in the Greek province of Tingkok.
But from year to year, the number of people who live with HIV and AIDS in Tingkok has increased to 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community Tiongkok.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in Tiongkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be worse.
Given the conservative value of this country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many health - care professionals work among those infected with sexually transmitted diseases.
Since 2003, the Tingkok government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff has corrupted the GOP senator's data, spread 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The U.S. representative of Maxine Waters on Saturday argues that one member of his staff has sent personal information to three senators of the United States Republic of America to the side of Wikipedia members of parliament.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles stressed that the climate was driven by experts and the "ultra-rightwing" website.
"False lies, lies, and many more cruel lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information written includes address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
This information appeared on the day of Kamis, sent to the Senate by an unknown person in the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel on sexual misconduct against Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
This box appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment was linked to the Waters office and collected information from one of the staff of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"It's not based on this accusation that it's really wrong and it's a bloody lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member -- who is identity, personal information, and his safety are at risk of the consequences of the false and wrong charges -- at the same time is not responsible for this lack of information.
That is indeed a great sin, and it is a false slander."
Waters’ statements quickly draw attention to the deep criticism, including that of the secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"It means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"Does this show that he's not suitable to be Congress Member.
If someone is accused of doing something that is not right, he does not deserve to be held accountable.
They are not deceived.
They could not question the motive of the official.
They must be peaceful and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reactions of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Christian congregation of the day.
Omar Navarro, a member of the Republican party who is trying to track down Waters in a half - hour election, also shares his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authority and law enforcement entity about this wrong charge.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be caught," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that damage and endanger one and all my staff."
Johnny's English Stripes Again - Rowan Atkinson's missing eyebrow
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with the common view of England has become a tradition and it seems to be a return to Johnny English code sequence -- which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would you like to learn more about how bad it is to become a new export opportunity for this country?
However, Johnny English, who was blind and deaf, and the lack of skill, has issued his license to destroy everything for which he twice gave more guidance than anything that he was a broad comical creation designed for the field of cinemas in addition to English.
Of course, he was a crazy secret agent, who, in his strange mood, had some Clouseau character, one Mr. Bean character, and one of the pilots who contributed a little bit of notes to the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 opening of the London Olympics.
In fact, he was based on the legend and the international mystery man Atkinson who had been playing at the Barclaycard TV news now forgotten, leaving the mess behind.
There's one or two sweet moments on the latest JE trip.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter by wearing a middle- and round-circuit jelly clothes with speeding in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy was displayed, but his humor felt less tense and too strange, especially when film marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible were confident to introduce comedy as a material.
Humor feels like it's meant for children from adults, and for me there's a variety of Johnny English novelty that's not innovative and the focus of Atkinson movie jokes in Bean's personality.
The prize that's been burning for these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyberpath has entered a super secret English web site, covering the identity of all British agents in the field, to discourage the agent responsible -- he seems to be just a small part of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last opportunity for a proud and hostile minister's career, which has destroyed its total political population: Emma Thompson plays very well with the character of almost-Teresa-May but few can be from his passion.
His wise advice gives information that because every active eye has been weakened, he has to bring one out of retirement time.
And that means Johnny's uncle English himself, now employed as head of school in some remote buildings, but he gave a secret lesson about how to do the rescue operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offered blinds' academics such as School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for the funeral and was reunited with a long - suffering old friend, Bugh, once more by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, recruiting a ship commander, the high-class woman's role on which Vicki Pepperdine is a little abandoned.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake on the High Secret Agent back in action, met the mysterious woman Ophelia Bulletova, who was commissioned by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the minister's division is alarmingly falling into the influence of charismatic technologies that claim to be able to solve England's computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their condolences: being a servant, they burned French fast restaurants; they made a mistake by throwing themselves on Volta's own boat; and English moved anarchy when he tried to use the headset Virtual Realities to familiarize himself with the inner house of Volta.
All the arrests were certainly attracted to the last sequence, but with such a hug and a smile, there was a little TV series of kids who had all about it.
It's quite moderate.
And like other Johnny English movies, I can't think of it: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a really good role for his team?
The contestants are planning plans for English citizens to work four days a week but pay five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the United States considered a radical project that required four days of work each week but five days of pay.
It was reported that the owners of the company wanted to continue to produce the harvest through a revolution of artificial wisdom (AI) for the workers by giving them more leisure days.
He will let his slaves enjoy the end of the three days, but he will still have the same reward.
Some sources say that this idea will be 'pass' with a party' economic agenda and plans that motivate the country to support workers.
The four - day district convention of the United Kingdom was approved as a way for workers to experience economic changes.
One source, a senior U.S. senior said to The Sunday Times: 'The news of this event is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen in the evening, but four days of work a week is an aspiration appropriate to party placement to restore the economy that supports workers and the industry's strategy as a whole.'
The Mountain Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Hijau Party has promised four days of work in a week at the 2017 general election campaign.
However, not all members of the Governing Body have the backing of “the faithful and discreet slave ” and its Governing Body.
A speaker from the East said: "The Sabbath is not a part of the week, nor is it a part of the night considered."
The Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference last week to complete his vision of the socialist revolution in the economic field.
McDonnell says he's determined to regain power from the "anonymous director" and "catellers" in the utility company.
It also means that the consul now in the drinking water company may not get back all of it because the government of the Mountain Party can do 'lost' for the reasons that it feels like.
He also made sure that his plan was to put workers in the company's house and create an Inclusive Property Grant that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the secret sector to employees, which would win the annual distribution to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told "60 minutes" whether FBI research on Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has reported a final vote on his appeal in the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether this Bureau meeting could affect senators from the Republic Party to withdraw their support.
In a interview on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senator from the Republic Party. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, could the FBI find something that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his friends from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charges appeared, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He's a strong, strong, strong man."
However, it seems that Graham could not change his mind.
"I think I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and I need a bigger charge to change it," she said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett strongly argues about it," Graham added, pointing to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls his name can't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is meant by the Global Citizen Festival and What Did It Take to Fight Poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that features a series of spectacular stars, as well as a successful mission; the end of the world’s poverty.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be a witness to tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase the focus of this event, which is actually ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a follow-up from the Global Poverty Project, an international lawyer group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for this event (except you want to pay a VIP ticket), the concert conductors must complete some tasks or "actions" such as volunteers, email the world's leaders, telephones, or other means of doing something that helps to increase their commitment to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen achieved during the past 12 years?
Does the idea of giving a free concert is the right way to invite people to do something, or is it just another case called "clictivism" -- people feel like they make real difference by signing an online poll or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said more than 19 million "actions" have been published by its supporters, moving them to set other goals.
It has been said that this action has helped the world's leaders to announce a comitminant and glamour that would affect more than $2.25 billion in 2030.
In early 2018, this group gathered 390 commissions and announcements from their actions, including at least $10 billion.
It is estimated that this far - reaching threat of security has attracted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key complications among others The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in England made by investors and committed to "helping children grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's poverty after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, the contributor, the national government, and the Global Citizen as you are, we can make social injustice about this lack of iron become a record in history," the director of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the London audience at a direct concert in April 2018.
This group also says that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced a project, Power of Nutrition, which will take over 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Faced with one of the questions on the Public Reply on their website that asked "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizenship answers: "This will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just as the movement of the great civil rights and anti-parity rights that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we are united we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of the stars that appear at this annual event in New York, to be raised by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Ocean as a "blockade" to limit Russia's energy exports - Secretary of State
"If necessary" Washington could ask for the help of the Red Sea to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke revealed, as Washington Examiner translated.
Zinke strongly assumed that Russia’s involvement in Syria - in particular, in its place operating on government guests - is a country to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy makers, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reports.
And, according to that office, there's a way and a way to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Seafront, to ensure the open sea route, and, if necessary, to make blockades, to make sure that their energy cannot enter the market," she said.
Zinke spoke in front of the event organizers by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of narrators who called himself "the energy dealers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's engagement with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of efficiency, they are the same.
"The economic choices in Iran and Russia are less than, benefiting and replacing fuel," he said, adding to Russia as one "skiller in the field" with an economy that depends on fossil fuel.
This statement appeared when the Trump government representative was doing a mission on the scale of increasing their exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much easier choice for European slaves.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including President Asa Donald Trump himself, tried to get Germany to attract itself from the North Stream oil pipeline project, which according to the Trump, made Berlin a "branch" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil pipeline project is worth $11 billion, which is designed to reduce the capacity of oil pipelines that are up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that the strong opposition of Washington to this project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made tools to make pressure and that the traitor must be able to choose his own successor," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with Energy Minister AS Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This attitude has attracted reactions from Germany, which has emphasized their commitment to this project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the US not to participate in the EU energy chain and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a major problem if the third country shares our energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "Course the Situation" When Acting as President in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he'd "record the situation" when he resigned as president after a half-time election.
While campaigning in the city halls of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted that he consider suicide.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our fragile government, including put women in the theater," he said to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll take a look at the situation when I take myself as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he campaigned in the cities, saying that he "takes this area to the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's blogging his criticism of Trump and the Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We just need the FBI investigation before we do the polls."
However, a survey published on Thursday, shows that most of Warren’s own constitution did not want him to hang out in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "insurance" voters in Massachusetts say that the senator is not self-deprived, according to Sufpolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent of the people who support the team.
The report shows that more support for Governor Deval Patrick was given to self - defense, with 38 percent who supported the possibility of self - denial and 48 percent who opposed him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that were discussed in connection with the possibility of suicide in 2020 include President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Beden said he'd officially decide it in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin called PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and sentenced to violence in his home on Sunday night
"What happened to my son, what will happen when he comes back, I can contact other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of our soldiers," he said in front of the audience at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans, "turned back a little bit differently, they came back stronger, they returned and asked if there was any respect for what they had given, the soldiers and the refugees and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Sunday in Wasilla, Alaska, and sentenced to domestic violence against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in drinking situations, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department.
18 member states, D.C., are supporting the challenges of the new tobacco industry
Eighty - eight states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new U.S. government laws that refuse to vote for victims who flee from gangs or violence in their homes.
A representative from 18 parts of the region and the district brought friends-of-the-court briefings on Friday in Washington to support audio researchers against this trend, NBC News reported.
Named after Grace v. In a session dedicated to the American Civil Liberties Union in August on federal youth, it was not yet revealed.
He said his partner "and his son who is a cruel gang member," he was disappointed, but the U.S. officials refused his vote on July 20th.
He was detained in Texas.
The country’s forces supporting Grace depict El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have produced large - scale stadiums for the United States, as a country facing major challenges with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. music industry has turned its back on the 2014 Imigran National Assembly, which allows blind immigrants to flee from domestic violence in order to sing.
Judge General District of Colombia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new bill "responses to the laws of the state, federal, and international that have existed for several decades."
"The federal law insists that all climates should be issued on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to that climate, and that such prohibitions violate the principles," said friend-of-the court brief.
More wisdom suggests a little that the youth who refuses to enter immigration undermines the US economy, says that they will have a great chance of becoming an entrepreneur and "increasing the strength of the work that is needed."
Judge Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge not to give a vote to victims who fled from violence in their homes and gangs.
"If it is prepared for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or political turmoil in a particular social group, or political opinion," the Sessions said in a press release on June 11.
It's not meant to solve all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people are facing every day all over the world.
The hope of salvation that is so painful in the Valley is because the victims are playing with time to find a safe sacrifice.
For those who survived, the situation was worse.
"It's very hard," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, gratified her son who was staying at the refugee center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes bringing the body.
Clean water is very low."
The colors are seen back to their destroyed homes, taking water-stained stuff, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and taken to the hospital, the damage caused by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, and it was devastating.
Some of them have been injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffers from back and back pain, spreads outside the Palu Hospital, where patients are treated outside the room because of severe fatigue.
The tears of her eyes streamed when she told back how she felt when she was in the middle of the night that she was living with her wife and daughter in the hotel room.
"It's not easy to save yourself.
I think I'm stuck around the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, adding his family there to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then I recovered.
I didn’t know what to do with my daughter.
May they prosper."
The great U.S. government accused Tiongkok of "intimidating" with "propagandist propaganda"
A week after Tiongkok's official press published four ads on an US day that referred to the profit of the football back to AS-Tiongkok, the U.S. Supreme Court for Tingkok accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the Soviet Union later referred to the supplement to pay China Daily in Des Moines Registers - a newspaper published in the state of Iowa - after Tiongkok accused him of trying to join the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge that had been filed by Tiongkok.
The trumpet claim that Beijing is trying to join the U.S. election, which confirms what the U.S. officials say to Reuters, is a new phase in the increase of the Washington campaign to press Tingkok.
Although it is common for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now involved in a growing business war, which has led them to raise the import rate of each other.
The price of Tiongkok's compensation at the beginning of this trade war was designed to accommodate exporters in such countries as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trump, says experts Tiongkok and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Prime Minister for Tiongkok and the former governor-in-Office of Iowa, exporting the main agricultural goods to Tiongkok, says Beijing has destroyed workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tingkok, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now undermines that intimacy by running propaganda advertising on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Tingkok government uses the tradition of freedom of speech and Persian freedom that is highly valued in America by publishing the advertising paid in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in Kios-Kios selling street newspapers here, in Beijing, you will find a solution to different sounds and will not see a real guarantee on the different views that the Tingkok people may have about the poor Tiongkok economy, remembering the media is under the control of the Tiongkok Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most outstanding media in Tingkok refuses to offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which message.
Reminiscent Analysis, Republican Party Dissembles Women's Elections to Share Timely Elections in Kavanaugh
As important children in the Republic Party stand and defend the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of a number of sexual violence charges, the analyst has warned that they will see an attack back, especially from women, in the general election of the time to come.
The emotions about this problem are very high, and most members of the Republic's party have already shown that they want to move on to the conclusion of the vote.
Grant Reeher, a political professor at Maxwell School, said to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected Senator Jeff Flake at the end of the minute to do the FBI investigation would be enough to provoke anger on the voters.
"Wanta won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group said it on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" when they held a demonstration at the Senate hall when the Republic's party controlled the Committee of Justice to continue in Kavanaugh's coup d'état of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Antisianism and motivation for democracy will come out of the list," political analyst not part of Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
People say it's too high, and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among female voters in the rural areas and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before Ford's public witness described in detail the sexual harassment against himself by the Supreme Court’s council, the analysis suggested that there would be a reverse attack following if the Republican party continued to urge him to proceed with confirmation.
"This has become an obstacle to the GOP," said Michael Steele, head of the National Committee of the Republical Party, first week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the board of advice, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this problem and how they do it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose the Democratic Party, shows the whole story.
But the Americans seem to be different about who should be trusted after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more choice than the last one.
A new opinion by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents really believe or possibly believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or possibly believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Kavanaugh might or actually lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something like Ford.
After the release from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and another official, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford witnessed under oath in front of the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh who was in a state of drunkenness attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the councils of the Supreme Court showed him their popularity when they attended a party while they were attending a school in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Viewer Plans to Start a New Internet for Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, your World Wide Web insight, has launched an effort to launch Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and whoever is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company, a joke by Berners-Lee says that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start it now," he said from the start.
"It's a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "private online data storage" or POD.
This can include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available at the same time on one browser.
The uniqueness of this private online data storage is that it's really the most widely distributed user who can access any type of information.
In a company known as "private credit through data."
The idea of setting up Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the right resources, processes, and skills to help make the Solid available to all.
This company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few staff builders opposed to project work, and the volunteer community of code makers.
At the beginning of this week, technological developments around the world can make their own decentralization applications use the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to identify or not a total change where all their business models are really going to be converted in the evening.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post in Medium released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide energy and the commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become a voice that has influenced the neutrality of the network debate.
Even when Inrupt is destroyed, Berners-Lee will remain the Director and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next website," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Warning about the WW1 Victoria Cross
The only church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was buried in the land of her birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won his prize on September 29, 1918, over the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attacks.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a Nazi firing squad and never knew that he had won the highest honor in the British military.
A warning stone was placed by two of his grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of her cousins, Michael Vann, said this was a "symbolic symbol" that would reveal exactly 100 years of great appreciation for her grandfather's performance.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "sucking a very heavy bag under the firing range from field weapons and machines."
Then he rushed to the top line and with the "greatest courage" led the front line before he stepped on his own field gun and dropped three decibels.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German bomber on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I can't live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he's "very popular with the role in this paradise" and adds "the courage of a real hero is being shown with the support that many people will give."
MMA reporters started at night to watch Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig.
Think about this, you've been waiting for the night to watch Bellator 206 full of stuff just to be refused to watch the main event.
St. Jose's team fought 13 battles, including six in the main cards and was being displayed right through the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., exactly when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face each other, the viewers in England were forced to act when his appearance changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel worthless after they have reached the end of the race for life.
A blogger on Twitter describes a change to a child's cartoon movie as a "crazy joke."
"This is the rule of the government, that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate to be described, so replaced by the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of the disease and communication of Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Bappa is a baby," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said they would improve their coverage by counting the views of England in the future.
"I think, if we think about the return, I think we might be able to solve it," Coker said.
"But now there's six o'clock on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Sunday their time.
But we're doing it.
Believe me, at the time of change, many times the text goes back and everything doesn't teach.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, it won't happen again.
We will reduce up to five of the six wars we have fought, and we will try to avoid more entertainment, and we will succeed.
It's a useless situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'meaning' about sexual problems
The Olympics Tom Daley said he grew up humbly because of his sexuality problem but that gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't recognize him until he went to high school, that "not everybody like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs sent by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being an adult made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual program that has been carried out recently, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months of medication because of the disease.
Apparently as the missing people on the first Laverne program, Daley said he felt "not compared" to all the other people who grew up with him because "it's nothing that can be socially accepted to love men and women."
He said, “So far, this is a strange feeling, and different feelings have been the real ones that gave me strength and strength so that I can achieve it.”
He wants to prove that he's "something," he says, so he won't disappoint everyone when they know about the problem of sexuality.
These two Olympic medals have become well-known LGBT champions and have been used in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he was talking because he felt lucky to live with an open mind without consequences and wanted to give someone else a "hope."
This three-time world actor said he fell in love with a man -- a filmmaker from the AS Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "I'm surprised."
Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older than he did this last year, and she says that aging is not a problem.
"If you're having so many problems at the age of very young," -- he followed the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died because of cancer three years later -- he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age as the same surgeon.
This couple has grown up in June, with a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "all the perspectives" have changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all a little bit 'I have to win gold medals'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than some winning the Olympic gold medal.
The gold of the Olympics is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got a ticket to the London Olympic 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the front line.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit on the front line'," she said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, finally I admitted that he wasn't defeated," she said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympic Games.
"And I know it's just, this is what I've been thinking all my life -- to fall in front of the crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired the first - volume selection - Proud by Heather Small - which he had agreed with in his preparation to go to the Olympics and still made him spin.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday, 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when he was born on Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played for two years to record the 12th record, was awarded by Captain Jim Furyk for the game of four balls and a team race on Saturday.
The students are in the middle of action, as he usually does for the United States, the main winner of these five times divides his time between being a knight and doing his game on that line, hoping he could fix what's bothering him.
Never become the most honest golf player, even though at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not suitable to follow a very strict course in Le Golf National, who regularly gives long and severe punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the most accurate English race of Francesco Molinari, which has worked together with new arrivals Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starting with a hot start, then Michaelson's competition will prove very important.
Furyk told me he trusted this man, not because he could say a lot more.
"He really understood his role today, he turned his back and hit me, and said he'd be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I pictured in my mind another way, but that is the way it was, and that is the way we thought we should go.
He wants to enjoy the rest of his life, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most popular Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could represent the end of his career at Ryder Cup that will never mention the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 winnings, 20 winnings, and seven series, although Furyk said that his presence brought some things he could not say to the team.
"He's funny, he's pregnant, he's cruel, he likes to hug people, and he's clean in the team room," she explains.
"I feel like a younger player has fun with him, too this week, which is pretty fun to see.
He's giving more than a few games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great chaos can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who led quite big enough to his last alone match in Ryder Cup could easily become an unpleasant journey.
Dane did his first debut in 1997 in Valderrama, with the captain of the Sve Ballesteros team holding five points on America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the most typical margin, won 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"Don't keep reminding yourself that we get a big intrusion in Valderrama; we get a big intrusion in Brooklyn, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we just win," said Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 good on Friday and tomorrow with 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you're going into a really boring game.
Get out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get a point on the writing board.
We have advice, and the advice is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've been focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side-- the most amazing players in the world."
It's good to see players playing in the hard golf field, Bjorn adds: "I'll never make it myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual player will make progress, and this is a different thing to do.
It's so nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golf player will be tested.
That's the message you have to deliver to all players, get your best out of yourself for tomorrow's match.
Now, you leave your friends and he has to go get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will ask his player to play better individually than they do as a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been at the end of the final day of the big competition, has become part of the winning team in Brooklyn before the European triumph of "Midna's Miracles."
"I remember all those words," she answered a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, unites his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it as quickly as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Medinah.
When the moment moves one direction, it will give a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also organize the playlists and put people in different ways that we think, you know, we're trying to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to take the lead in the fight against Rory McIlroy in the dramas, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players in the drama.
"I'm going with this group of people in order like this because I think I can close all the roads," Bjorn said about his only choice.
The new German warship was locked back.
The latest German Coast Guard vessel should have begun its task in 2014 to replace an old Cold War warship, but the ship will not be there until the next year because of the wrong system and its increased financial resources, the media have reported.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship from the new Baden-Wuertmberg class guardship, has now been detained until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which advocates military speaking.
The ship was supposed to be connected to the Ocean Coast in 2014, but the shipping problem was disturbing the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Weerttemberg class ships that have been launched by the Sea Coast in 2007 will come as an old Bremen class watchman ship.
This ship will be equipped with a strong range, a range of anti-aircraft wheels, and anti-ships, as well as some silencing technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important fittings include a longer period of treatment that would have been allowed to use the latest surveillance ships for two years from its original port.
However, the continuous march means this battleship -- which is said to allow Germany to exert its power abroad -- will soon begin when the time of its task, Die Zeit writes.
The F125, the worst-accident surveillance vessel has become a news item years ago, when the German Navy officially refused to hand over the ship and sent it back to the port of Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Ocean Coast returned the ship to the ship’s manufacturer after delivery.
There are only a few known reasons behind the ship's return, but the German media has raised a number of important "distorting weapons and heavy weapons" that make the ship useless if used for the war mission.
The destruction of the radio equipment is very important because the Baden-Weerttemberg class ship will be operated by a ship crew of 120 passengers - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class warship.
It is also known that the ship's boat is much more likely to reduce its energy and limit the ability of the Seabed to add to the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with 7,000 tons of bobots is twice as heavy as the German class used in World War II.
In addition to the damage done by heavy equipment, the cost of the whole project — including the training of shipbuilders — has also become a problem.
It's said that it's amazingly worth up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - a ship from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem of the latest surveillance ships becomes very important to recall the latest warning because of a breach of the German coast.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, admitted that the Seabed was indeed "the destruction of ships with the ability to spread."
The officer said that during the time of this problem, it was growing, as old ships were no longer used, but no replacement ships were prepared.
He regretted that not one of the Baden-Wuertmenberg Class Guard ships could be connected to the Seabed.
National Trust hears the secret life of silence
A recent survey was conducted at a meeting in the High Court of Scotland that was designed to cover the use of natural resources in their food supply.
It is hoped that this meeting will provide a fresh light on this unique flight path and will help to direct conservation activities in the future.
A study by scientists at National Trust for Scotland will follow the popular and sophisticated Pipistrelle as well as the long-distance and daubenton of Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special trains will be placed at the main location around the property to follow the cycle activities throughout the period.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out a full - time inspection using the angle detector.
The audio analyser will ensure the frequency of the audio and video calls and the specifics of which the activity is carried out.
Then the map and the habitat report will be made to draw a picture of the world’s ever - increasing beauty about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes that this result will cover which habitat is most important to the landscape and how each species uses it.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental degradation, such as the construction of grassland, and the best way to preserve forests for forests and other related species.
The schooner population in Scotland and throughout England has been active in the last few centuries.
The area was threatened by the lack of construction and development that affected the area and its habitat.
Turbin winds and obstacles also pose risks, such as the high - tech paper for heating and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as the attack on the protective environment.
In fact, the darkness isn't light.
However, because of his habit of working late into the night, his ears were more useful than his eyes in the pursuit of pleasure.
They're using high-tech rough spots to find exactly the exact amount of damage and damage on their flight route.
NTSC, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 square feet [66,000 sq m] throughout the country, is of great concern to the poor.
There are ten trained men who regularly do research, research, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has also established the first and only natural lakes in Scotland at the Troave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten rare species in Scotland.
David Thompson’s funeral manager said that the funeral was an area suitable for the funeral.
"Here in Thrave, we have a good area for the caravan," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still much we don't know about funerals, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of the surveillance of the hives prior to the preservation in the property, because without realizing there's a chance that one of the survivors could kill up to 400 minors, who might destroy the entire population in the area.
The fugitive thus never had to fear reprisal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Conservative of Trust, urged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about our ancestors and for many species we don't know how their populations come from."
Ronaldo, who refused to sign a warrant, was preparing a lawyer for the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo referred to himself as a "false story," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
The prosecutor would ask the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who examined the case.
The attacker was accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, who lived in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then expected to pay it by paying $375.000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a video from Langsung Instagram to 142 million of his followers a few hours after the clarinet was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, threatened the report as a "false story."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," winner Ballon d'Or said to the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with the smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is ready to challenge Der Spiegel on this charge, which they call "a complaint in the private field that cannot be accepted," says Reuters.
The critic Christian Schertz said he would ask for compensation as "a moral substitute in the number corresponding to the severity of the crime, which may be one of the most serious private offenders in the last few years."
The incident mentioned above took place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a camp at night, Ronaldo and Majorga were reported back to that player's room, where he was expected to have been questioned, according to a report made at the Clark District Court of Justice in Nevada.
Majorga said Ronaldo got drunk after the accident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good guy" that disappointed him was just "one percent."
The document said that Ronaldo allowed them both to have sex, but it was based on desire together.
Majorga also said he went to the police office and had performed a video about his injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because he felt "fear will get revenge" and was afraid "will be brought before the public."
This 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's constantly experiencing trauma over the incident she's accused of.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian Juve giant club with an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: England 'will regret it forever' for the loss of car manufacturers
England "will regret forever" if the loss of its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added "about" Toyota, England has told the BBC that if England comes out of the European Union without an agreement, for a while it will stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The original Japanese car manufacturer said that if there was no agreement, it would destroy Brexit in terms of employment.
The factory in Burnaston - making Auris and Avenue produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the entire European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we will see the production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's performance in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about their exit from the European Union without an agreement on how border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, will run.
BMW, for example, said to close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the car manufacturer said was the risk of a collision without an agreement with Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on the basis of the "right time" production principle with a chain band that enters every 37 minutes well from the English and European Union farmer for a vehicle made in accordance with the order.
If England left the European Union without an agreement on March 29th, there may be obstacles at the border, which the industry considers to be a result of, at least, a shortage of rain.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's preparation in his office in Derbyshire, company representation, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says the Chequers Theresa May plan for a future relationship with the European Union is "decalibration precisely to avoid border checks."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success right now, but for us to get this opportunity," he told the today program from BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also from other producers, that we really need to be able to continue what has become a very well-fashioned railway."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warning that the increase in the revenue will reduce the power of the other industry and eventually destroy the labour market.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the U.S. director of the factory, said his members are more concerned: "My experience, so that this job is gone, will never come back again.
The government speaker said, "We've made the right plan and have reason for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may come back late, fresh white building.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the Chief Justice of Rod Rosenstein could "come back a week" because the battle of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White Building said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's campaign in general elections, relations between the Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential of the president to bring justice to the public.
Whether the Trump will throw out a big shot or not, which will endanger Mueller's freedom, has been chasing the gosips in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and possibly lower the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein argues that report.
But on the last Sunday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was going to leave.
On the contrary, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the PBB office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump says he's gonna "choose no" disarm Rosenstein, but the meeting is again ordered to avoid harassment with the Senate court committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both will testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a FBI investigation for one week on a complaint against Kavanaugh, which continued to announce the completion of the Senate's full vote.
Secretary Tromp, Sarah Sanders, sampled on Fox News Sunday.
His day about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for that meeting has not yet been set, perhaps in this week, I can see that turning it back to another good week also recalls the other things that happened in the grand court.
But let's see, and I always want to give the latest news to the press."
Several reporters will object to the statement: Sanders has not been holding a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The director of the event asked Chris Wallace why.
Sanders says it's not because he doesn't like TV journalists who try to draw attention, though, he says, "I don't really agree that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggested that they communicate directly between Trump and the Persians.
"The president asked more questions directly than the previous president," she added without mentioning the evidence: "We have seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, Sanders says, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
The routine team raises questions when leaving the White House or participating in the opening session or in a press conference with the visiting high officials.
The press conference just rarely happens.
This week in New York City, the president may show him why he is doing this, and he may be surprised to see that the news is being heard in one place after another.
Health secretary wrote to European workers in NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express appreciation for the country and hope that they will still work here after Brexit's crisis.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent letters in less than six months until England withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed itself to completing the permanent status payments for European citizens who work in the transferable public service.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between England and the European Union on this self-esteem still continue, nearing the decision expected in the autumn.
However, the British government has also been preparing for the possibility that there will be no treaty.
I know it must be very disturbing for you all.
That is why I now want to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, who was left of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union, and others, brought with them valuable experiences and skills that strengthened and improved the work of health services, and benefited the patients and the society we served.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Maintains Writing After Heathing
Shortly after Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after a head injury on 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
The Head of State of Tennessee, Rod Reed told the victim that it happened shortly before the father died.
"He came to the countryside and fell down there," said Reed.
Doctors and doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen in the field prior to placing it in the soil and taking it to further assessment.
An official from the Tennessee District State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has gone out of the operating room in the center of the Vanderbilt Media.
Harris added that "there's no detail about the kind of damage that happened" and the Tennessee District State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a graduate of these two red-eyed colleges, was in the first period with the Tennese District State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five tickets on Saturday before he left the competition, which made his total ticket during this period to be 18 tickets.
Foreign buyers will use higher taxes when buying properties in England
Foreign buyers will use higher materials when they buy properties in England, together with additional funds to help tourists in accordance with the new Tory article
This step will keep Corbyn moving fast in attracting the young election
This material will be used in behalf of those who do not pay taxes in England
The Department of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the tsunamis.
Foreign buyers will use a higher price when they buy property in England and buy extra money that will be used to help tourists, and Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be considered as an effort to keep Jeremy Corbyn from making a quick effort to attract the young ones with a promise to provide a more comfortable environment and to encourage them to take a firm stand for what is right.
Material gains will be made available to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that the government has made to fight against corruption.
In addition to today’s rising cost of food, including a higher level that was noted two years ago for buying a second house and for buying a house for up to three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to go up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London were purchased by non-Ingris, which made it even more difficult for the first buyer to raise his feet at the farm.
Many of the rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital -- have become "the ghost city" because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new publication was released only a week after Boris Johnson collected material donations to help many young people to have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the high price of property by buying land but not using it, and urged Ny May to abandon the kitchen for your rented homes to improve "farm" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reforms in an interesting field, including surveillance of the weather and ending the "no guilt".
He also wanted to give greater power to the temple to build new houses.
Ny May says: “A year ago I promised I would assign the missionary service to restore the dream of England - that life should be better for each generation.
And that means improving our farm market that's broken.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not proper for individuals who do not live in England, as well as for those who do not live in a land of their own country, to purchase and purchase modest homes for themselves and their families.
For many people the dream of having a house is very far, and the conduct of an unscathed course is always true."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the team of Scotland'
Bos Sunderland, Jack Ross says "the main ambition" is to be Scotland's manager at some levels.
This 42-year-old Scotland player enjoys the challenge of reliving the North-East club, which now lives in the third league of the First League, in addition to three points from the ground position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the former Scottish Premier League.
"I want to return my country as a player.
I got Top B and that's him," Ross said to Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often looked at the Scotland team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always became something that drew me back.
But that opportunity will come, if I succeed in the team management."
Manager Sunderland before Ross included Dick Advocate David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This mantan bos Alloa Athletic said he didn't feel proud to follow the lead of the big names in that big club, after he had rejected the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the failure now will be condemned by 'Can I bring this club back to the League of Premier?'
Because the structure and facilities in this club are no longer in doubt about being in the League of Premier," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there."
Ross ’ career in the team management was only three years old, after some time as a boss assistant in Dumbarton and spent 15 months as a training staff in Hearts.
And he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to the third position, and turned St. Mirren from the degradation circle into the next season's winner.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he's ever done during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably the way I have to go," he said when he took Allao.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, looking for breath in a good way, and enjoying some good things.
But playing can be difficult.
Many things you have to spend every week.
I still have it in work pressure, but in management it feels good.
I always want to lead something and now I do it, the most satisfying feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."

Survei found, the exact time for drinking beer was 17.30 a.m. on Saturday.
The hot climate has increased the public opinion in England that is fighting to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
The figures show that the Pub group and the bar saw a 2.7 - percent increase in sales in July - July, but the polls in the restaurant dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who echoed those figures, says: "The bright days of the British elections and the long-term participation in the World Cup, the month of July will follow the same pool as June before, where the public opinion increased by 2.8 percent, except for the fast-paced restaurant.
It's going to make the big restaurant sales of 1.8 percent in June, and it's going to be worse in July.
The sale of pub and bar that sells this far-off drink is the most powerful compared to what happens at the downside restaurant.
The Pub who sells food also suffers from sunburn, even though not a single restaurant operator.
Looks like people just went out for a drink.
The sale in the entire pub and the bar sold drinks up to 6.6 percent this month, with the sale of three percent down."
Paul Newman, an analysis of RSM's recreation and hotelkeeping, says: "This result continues the train we've seen since April.
Reading and seeing social events or sports events continue to be the biggest factor that comes with market sales outside the home.
It is not surprising that a group of restaurants continues to fight to survive, although the generation of big sales of 4.8 percent of the year by year will be very painful on the pressure of the money that is happening.
The long heat must not come when the operator sells food during bad times, and the time will tell us if the hot enough heat we've enjoyed in August will give us some needed rest."
The total sales growth throughout the pub and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, is 2.7 percent in July, showing the drop in mercury.

Twenty percent of students say they operate a "main" account that has been cleaned to show the parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret place, found a teenager who asked others to "my strength."
A study conducted by the British Digital Association and the HMC Heads of School and Women's School (HMC) from independent schools found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says: "Is it so disturbing that so many young people are trying to create online rooms that their parents and teachers cannot find?"
Elid Doyle will be "a warning for athletes" in the Scottish athletic house.
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish athletic building as non-executive director at the general meeting of the presidential council year.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete and field of honor and leader Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those leading the sports field to benefit from its experiences at international level over the last few decades.
"Elid is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing them into the temple," said Beattie.
Doyle says, "I act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help drive sports in Scotland."
The U.S. athletic athletes, who won a race of 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the total four gold medals of the Olympics and now become the BBC expert, are now unable to run after the time of an ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “This month I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor says it's only time I can determine if I can recover and up to the level of recovery.
It is a very difficult job to get back in full - time service, to learn how to conduct Bible studies, and to do hard work today!
Thank you for the warmest messages."
Poppy pump advertising that compares mother to dog has broken the mind of the online world
The advertising industry has distorted the thinking of the Internet and has even made it more like a mother who is visiting a prostitute.
In order to mark the production of what is called "the first bridge pump to be used in the world," Elvie's technology company wrote an inspired announcement from the kind of music video to show the freedom this new pump has given to express a mother.
Four moms dance in the hammock and follow the song that describes the smiles like this: "Yes, I'm laughing myself, but you don't see the corner" and "If you don't notice this isn't ambing, it's my dad."
It goes on: "The pumps out, the pumps out, I give them a nice meal, the pumps out, the pumps out, I suck my wife's milk."
However, advertisements published on this company’s Facebook page have raised online objections.
With 77,000 times and hundreds of comments, this video has received a dramatic response from the hunter, with many who say it makes "frequency" in the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision using a snake to trigger this product.
Like us, dogs must also be pregnant and born to produce milk, except the baby was stolen from them in a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another comment: "Trauma can be understood as well for mother and baby.
But why didn't you use it to advertise the father's pump for the mother who had to take care of the baby?"
The other said, "It's a lost announcement."
The other one was defending the announcement, with a woman who admitted that she saw the song "fucking."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still on my way.
Measuring makes me feel exactly like a dog.
It's a little crazy, but I've got it.
It's a generic product," someone wrote.
The other commented: "This is a good news for mothers who are pregnant, and who feel like they're going to die.
This is not an advertising that glorifies or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with the hidden pumps hidden in their bra.
This campaign concept is based on the age of many Asian women who say they feel like a snake.
However, Elvie Pump was really thin, without cables or ropes and passages in the bra, which gave women the freedom to move, around their babies, and even went out for a shower.
Ana Bararin, a Mitrate and ECD in Mother, comments: "The Elvie pump is a portable product that is worthy of destruction with convincing and provocative.
By referring to the image between the expression of women and the sex we want to attack the ASI and all its challenges, as well as showing it through the way to comfort and enjoy the freedom that the new pump has created.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump became the main news.
At a London Fashion Week, a mother with two children showed up at the catwalk for the designer Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrans moving quietly to the Dark House in the Texas border
The number of children detained while fighting the monthly limit has not changed, partly because of the harsh statements and threats made by the Tromp government that criticizes children's rape with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear of endangering their own ability to stay in that country by making progress to save children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that the sponsors and other adult members of the family should give their consent, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an elder in the field of Imigrant and Bea Cukai, witnessed in front of Congress that the school had arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor children under the age of.
The prosecutor then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have criminal records in circulation.
"About 80 percent of those who become sponsors or members of sponsors are in this country illegally, and most of them are foreigners.
So we keep looking for them," Mr. Albence said.
In order to process children faster, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which became a standard before, to hold a place of assistance.
Most of them appeared through videoconferencing, not directly, to request their legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who feel unworthy of help will be disfellowshipped.
As the children were arrested, their chances of getting worse or worse, causing them to become more violent or trying to escape themselves, holding the place of support and reporting the system that was accepted in the last few months.
Lawyers say that anxiety increases in a larger facility like Tornillo, which is marked by a child who is struggling to escape because of its size.
They arrange that moving children to a rural town without providing sufficient time to make them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can spread the trauma that has already been discussed.
Syria asked the US, France and Turkey to return immediately
In the general capital of the PBB, Prime Minister Luar Landi Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as a minister's representative, said foreign troops were illegally resident in Syria, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will certainly be affected."
"They must turn away as quickly as they can, without any requirement," he said.
Moualem asserts that "wars against terror are almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He insisted that Damascus would continue "fighting this holy war until we clean up all Syria's territory" from a terrorist group and "the illegal presence of foreign soldiers."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly training and influence Kurdish and Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn part of the country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem insisted that they should return immediately, and he accused "a few Western countries" because of "extraordinary fear" which forced refugees to move further away.
"We have asked international society and human society to falsify this fraud," he said.
"They're policeing what should be a problem for the whole human race."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was concluded.
U.S. diplomats say the latest agreements between Russia and Turkey to establish a zone of siege in the last major Idlib rebels have given rise to further political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large number of Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where there were three million people living.
But Moualem insists that this agreement has "a clear time" and suggests that military action will deter the mujas including the war from Front Nusra related to Al-Qaeda, which "will be defeated."
The PBB Staffan de Mistura team hoped to announce quickly the first meeting of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members to make the Military Orders for Syria and open the way to the general election.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the intervention of the Syrian government in the committee, stressing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to avoid the most recent aspects of the Law," and warned against the struggle of hands.
Why the Triumph Will Win a Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election in 2020 except because many liberal observers hope, contests and scandals will end its presentation here.
There's no doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presentation ever."
So far, there are no signs of weakness for viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s peaks have increased more than twofold by 1.05 million and MSNBC by nearly threefold by 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average rate of 2.4 million viewers per hour, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" have been sitting on the top of the cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on the main news night.
"This is the enthusiasm that makes people excited because it's something that's not yet understood," reports Neal Baer, an ABC drama director "Designed Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a senior comedy writer and lecturer "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Truths About Going to Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He remembered a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give his voice right for Trump.
He asked.
"He said," 'because he made me laugh,' said Miss Scowell to me.

A lot of money from the outside goes to the most difficult part of the White House's election competition
As soon as Pennsylvania 17 had received the money box, it was a blessing to return to the two - seat convention in the same course.
The new Pittsburgh district is re-born, leading the Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrats - who won courses in other districts through the election of special season last summer.
Lamb advanced against another occupation, the Keith Rothfus, who now represented the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which was on its way to the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These letters were returned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were not constitutionally on the part of the Republic.
The new Pennsylvania 17 district conflict has largely affected the campaign between the sides of the main market, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The Lamb is more popular in Pennsylvania after a typical Maret special election, which is scheduled for the 18 Pennsylvania Convention District.
The course has been held by the Republican authorities for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Politicians have promoted a slightly higher movement of the Democratic Party.
A.S. Prosperating El Salvador's Punishment for Supporting Tiongkok, Then Back
Diplomats ensure that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and sent a hotel in Panama to the mission to expel the Trump Management Team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to draw back the American diplomatic mission head from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision that no longer acknowledges Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokesman, posted in an initial statement this month.
However, the only legal remedy was El Salvador, which received about $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug control, construction and economic support.
The proposed legislation, which includes the extension of the financial assistance and the destruction of the visas, will damage the Central American country and reduce the rate of kidnapping and murder.
When an internal meeting took place, North American and Central American officials announced a high-level conference focusing on security and economic security to attend the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward in order to prevent immigration into the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials insisted that they wanted to continue the conference, so that the review of the case for El Salvador could be completed effectively.
President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a government import signal on the other side, the diplomats' statement.
And the third American envoys safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any further advice or severe punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, which agreed to discuss the internal assessment of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by a close - knit analyst who also spoke of the situation.
Study Edition
The other surprising story is the Special Adviser's report by Robert Mueller on the possibility of Mr. Trump's trial, which is now a very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his research on whether the Trump campaign was engaged with Russia in an attack on our public election.
When the convention was over, Mr. Trump was asked to take responsibility for his actions, as soon as he was ready to go in front of the voters, and he may eventually be a lawyer from among his colleagues.
So there is still much to do, and I do not mean to suggest that the fall of the Lord Trump regime cannot be avoided or neutralized in Europe.
There is a better choice we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long we have been fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of persecution.
In the beginning, history was centered around such a mythological point, and the swiftest or most destructive democracies could not be avoided.
Now the Americans are facing a few of these changes.
What should we do if the Trump deposes the Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then this report reports that last year, he suggested that they remain silent before the president and assume that he was not entitled to join the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times account was wrong.
"How do we react if the new F.B.I. investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair-- or if he is sent to the Supreme Court despite a strong charge of sexual assault and false testimony?
And in addition, will we give a voice at the time for Congress that will ask for Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass the test, democracy will grow worse in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had torn me apart.
She survived, then immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, asked me to place the Sabbath on the table that wrote swastika.
By leaving that heritage to me, how could I ever lose hope for our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans felt optimistic about the race facing Rapid Vienna
Rangers meeting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, after victory over Austria, sending good results in Spain against Villarreal this early month, will strengthen their position for the rest of the G League of Europe.
The crater made the middle of Graham Dorrans impossible to see in this first period until the 2nd against Villarreal, but he was confident that Rangers could use it as a rock of improvising danger.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go and pick up one point.
In the end, we may be able to do it, but, according to us, the harvest may be a righteous result.
At first, they may appear to be better off, but in the latter part, we got up and became a better team.
It's Christmas Eve. It's the other big day in Europe tonight.
We hope we can reach three points even though it will be hard competition because they have a good outcome in their final match, but, with support from supporters behind us, I'm sure we can continue to make progress and get a positive outcome.
Last year, we had a hard time, because it was because of my injuries and changes in the club itself but now there was a very good hope in this club.
This school is good and kids really enjoy it. It's a good training.

Although it seems that researchers have a curious idea of how they want to be cared for, few people discuss it with their family members.
Half of the people in the nationwide study are talking about long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of them say talking about this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start this operation," said Holly Snyder, president of the animal Assurance Business of the Nationwide.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family for care if you don’t tell them your first wish.
Talk with your family counselor, where and how you get care, because what you choose will mean very important in determining the cost.
Related to your financial advice: Your advice can certainly help you in showing how to pay those bills.
The custom you choose for long-term care involves a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy guaranteeing these regular bills or comparing yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have money.
Show the document you are proofing: There is a pending legal dispute.
Show immediate strength for your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your will is done by professional people when you cannot communicate.
On the other hand, a letter of strength on the matter of money should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to take care of all your financial decisions you have to choose, except to make sure you're paying your bills if you're not able.

A man shot a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a party night.
Those 40-year-old victims are in the field of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when they shot at their dad, their bitch, and their hands.
The shooting event is described by the officer as about 02:30 BST, and is said to be "the next action."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The victim's wounds did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses had been ordered by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunamis, so widespread that they hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Saturday, claimed to have killed 384 people, the death toll of officials, and the number of casualties expected to increase.
After the communication, officials who were involved in the difficulties were able to obtain information from Captain Dodrya, a region on the north side of the city of Palu, which was located close to the center of the dam, which was hit by a 7.5 - scale Richter scale.
In Palu, after the accident, more than 16,000 people were divacuated.
Below are a few of the main facts about the cities of Palu and Dodguria, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the close of the coastal edge of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated 379,800 lives in 2017.
When the clouds and tsunamis rise, this city is celebrating its 40th day.
At the same time, it was a total of more than 300 miles (180 km) from the western coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This figure, which is the administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 lives in 2017.
The central economics of the South Sulawesi province are looking for fish and farming, especially on the islands of Doghya.
However, there was an important role to play in this province, despite the fact that most of the people were scattered throughout the Sulawesi region.
Written in the last 100 years, Palu and Dodunga have been secreted several times by tsunamis, on the basis of data from Indonesia's Indonesian Bank.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in tsunamis and hundreds of homes in the late 1800 ’ s.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami accident in the Western Hemisphere.
According to one estimate, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ocean and its tropical rain forest is about to collapse.
The number of mines and large tsunamis that have taken place in the last few years is as follows:
The year 2004: 26 December, Indonesia was devastated by a massive earthquake, right on the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, to the death of 226,000 people across the Indian coast, and more than half the victims died in Aceh.
The year 2005 was March and early April, and a number of strong winds overwhelmed the western coast of Sumatra.
In the Nile River, along the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
The year 2006 was a peak of 6.8 people living in southern Java, the most populous Indonesian island in the world, causing nearly 700 deaths on the southern coast.
2009: The earthquake struck 7.6 near Padang, the capital of the Western province of Sumatra.
The death toll of more than 1,100 people.
2010: One island on the Isle of Mantawai, on the island of Sumatra, was also devastated by a strong earthquake, which struck a ten - foot - high [10 m] tsunami that suddenly hit the island and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya's grandfather, Aceh, also experienced a violent and devastating earthquake, as well as the arrest of those who remembered the disaster and tsunami that died in 2004.
Although this time it was not a tsunami, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
The year 2018: Lombok, a tourist island, also experienced a massive earthquake that claimed over 500 lives, most of which were on the north side of the island.
Its walls are filled with thousands of buildings, while thousands of tourists are stationed there.
A Mild - Tempered Son Was Imprisoned for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested with a coup d’état.
Palin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of domestic violence, suspended domestic violence reports and opposed arrests, as reported by the Dutch National Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a prominent woman tried to call the police to report her crimes, she picked up the phone from the woman.
Palin is distributed in Mat-Su's Court of Justice, with $500 unencumbered, as reported by KTUU.
As reported on the news network, Palin attended a meeting on Saturday, saying he was "not guilty, sure" when he was asked about his engagement.
Palin faced three minor Class A offenders, who could have spent a year in prison and a large debt of $250,000.
In addition, he was sentenced to 2,000 years in prison and was sentenced to 2,000 years in prison.
For Palin, the divorce order is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report on the attack.
The case is now referred to the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was called upon for domestic violence, forcing a report to separate domestic violence, and for possession of firearms in drinking conditions, which were also associated with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of smacking his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was arrested by a group of veterans who had related his son’s violence to PTSD as a result of his career in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, was devastated by an earthquake that claimed at least 384 lives.
The fire with the 7,5 - scale Richter potential to destroy the tsunami has set in motion thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are broken down, and death numbers are expected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck the southeastern part of the island of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video videos that show how dangerous these times are are to spread through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered together to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at that time, when the tsunami struck.
The federal court has tried to make a death sentence rare to suspect a terrorist attack on the NYC
The New York federal court tried to execute the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorist attacks in New York City, where eight people were killed -- including a rank and had not been executed in the federal criminal state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to take action by cutting off his truck from Home Depot on foot and riding a bicycle along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to allow this death penalty, the judges must prove that Saipov "by means of an oath" has killed eight of those victims and "by means of an oath" and that it has caused serious injury, on the basis of a statement of wish to bring down the death penalty, which was sent to South New York.
On the basis of a document of justice, the two charges allowed the death sentence to be dropped.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal court sentenced Saipov to 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in the pursuit of rape, which were usually used by federal courts in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and attempts to force motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early detection," as a picture of Saipov's crimes committed with "kiss, cruelty, and cruelty."
It was expressed in a statement of wish, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, harm, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco."
Five victims of this incident were originally from Argentina.
For a decade since South New York District, the death penalty has been severed.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, who was murdered by two drug dealers, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death penalty last time in New York federal court in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were accused of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
That couple, Rosenberg, died on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the documents of the trial, Saipov, who was from Uzbekistan, did not show that the trial was ongoing for several days and months after the attack.
When asked by the investigator, he said he was happy about what he had done, arresting the police.
Saipov also reveals to the authorities that his attack is the ISIS video inspiration that is being watched by his phone, as it is called.
She also asked for an ISIS warrant in her hospital room, a police officer.
He said he was innocent of the 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the public prosecutors representing Saipov, said "explainly disappointed" about the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to execute death rather than accept a sentence for life imprisonment without the guarantee of freedom will only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Pope Patton said.
Earlier, the Saipov relief committee had asked the court not to bring down the death penalty.
Nigel Farage is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage gathered to "increase the public" today in protest action at the Tory conference.
The Ukip leader maintains that politicians should 'strengthen their fire' Eurosceptics (anti-European anti-scientimes) - as one parliamentarian, Theresa May, urged to pursue fair conduct in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told the road action in Birmingham that England's 'should be out' now if Farage is serving as Secretary Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faced in the reconsultation of its shared position has been reduced by Remain Tories' supporters involved in a separate protest that threatened Brexit in that city.
The Minister's army is fighting to protect his Chequers compromise plan so that he can remain on his way even though in the middle of the Brexitiers, Remainers and the European Union.
The united states stress that it will move forward to reach agreement with Brussels, even if there is a bad reverse reaction -- and force Eurosceptics and the mountains to determine the choice between the package of origin and the 'consumption'.
Bone told the Leave Mens Leave in Solihull that he wanted to't throw up the checks.
In addition, Farage had to show his colleagues to be entrusted with the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If the respondent stays with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
In his statement, he just showed his contention in the European Union: "We don't fight in the war to be humble.
We want to lay down our own laws in our own country.'
Bone writes that public opinion has been able to bring about changes since the end of the 2016 vote: "The message that says that the thinking of the English people has changed and wants a permanent condition, it's quite wrong."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, also involved in the mass action, put it on the press: 'Just, I mean, the Ministerial War, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular in general terms, but opposition will not choose it, because it is not popular with our parties and activists who are really going down the road and make us elected in the first place.
Our request, cut down the Chequers and begin to listen to us.'
And he said, “They are the ministers who guard their work when their promise is fulfilled.”
Farage says that political demonstrations must be prevented in order to "smooth the fire" if they want to ignore the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now the most precious thing is faith between us and our people and our political groups," he said.
"They try to deny Brexit and we are here today, insist that we will not let you do that."
And he added in a message to a community gathering with an anti-tourism: "I want you to make our political groups, who are ready to reject Brexit, also feel its fury.
"We are moving the armies of this people who will conquer us in Brexit, and will not give up until the kingdom stands up, and the kingdom itself will be established, and we will build it."
Meanwhile, the remainers mass moved through Birmingham before they announced action at the city center for two hours.
Activist history seems to spread the descent of Tories Against Brexit after the collapse of the line at the end of this city.
Brothers in the Red Line, Lord Adonis, interviewed a Conservative Group on issues of security of their party application when the conference was opened.
"These people tell us that they can manage the IT system and all technology for Canada, however, for the counter-sustained limits, in the unlimited free trade range in Ireland," he said.
"It's really a big show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' his soul.
Warren's planning to do 'blow serious' at the president's office.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he'd "break up the president's flag" after the election season in November.
Boston Globe announces that the Massachusetts Democratic Party will announce its future in the cities of West Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who was facing the threat of President Donald Trump, volunteered to re-election in November against the GOP representative of the state party, Geoff Diehl, president of the Tromp campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was appointed to be the Trump fighter in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday evening in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which was announced in the format of the city since the Trump took office.
One of his colleagues asked him if he had any plans to take the lead in the preaching work.
Warren also answered, "This is the right time for women to enter Washington's neighborhood to rehabilitate our corrupt government, and that includes when women sit on top."
He's got the Sims shooting engine, the LSU player.
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced that he was arrested by the gunman who was suspected of being killed by Wayde Sims, a basketball player from the LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, arrested at 11 a.m. in the press conference.
They wrote a video of the shooting on Friday, where a man was identified asking for help as shown in the record.
Friday morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered head injuries and finally died," police chief Murphy J. Paul, to the media on Saturday, through 247 sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson fired his gun.
When he was interviewed, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene, held a fire gun, and shot him in the direction of Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any meaningful objection and was sent to prison in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A Junior player with 6 inches high, grown in Baton Rouge, that's the Sims juice, has played in 32 games with 10 matches in the past 17 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 straight balls in each match.
Dong Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world's rank after the team acknowledged his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in a qualified position on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team command to play a major role in the race.
From the field, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he kept his position on the first two and drew Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton go into the hole at the end of the audience, something that should be very specific.
Mercedes came in and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to follow after some learning actions that showed Ferrari's willingness to leave the part in the empty with the risk of being held after moving the gang to stand in the third floor.
Max Verstappen started on the line behind the grid and was at the seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the plane because he stopped changing the bank to speed up the solution and took the position of the Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
He finally went into the pit in the 44s but he couldn't increase his steps in the eights left because the Raikkonen finally took the fourth position.
That's a hard day because Valtteri's doing a fantastic job all over town and a real man who let me go.
Tim has done a great job to have one of two," Hamilton said.
It's a very ugly body.
President Donald Trump accused Senator Diane Feinstein of a riot on Saturday through his village, he did not corrupt Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence against Judge Brett Kavanaugh's throne
Speaking in a petition in West Virginia, the president did not immediately present a statement made by Ford in front of the Senate Court Committee, but commented on what was happening in a petition showing people who were "bad and dishonest."
"Something can happen and a beautiful thing is happening during the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and mean and lying and dishonesty," she said.
"When you saw the camera and the button and then they said, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you break it?
Remember the answer... did you break the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Okay, wait a minute.
No, we don't. "We don't. "More like a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter condemning Kavanaugh by Ford in July last, and this had been the case earlier in September - but Feinstein’s case did not come from his office.
"I don't hide Dr. Ford's charge, I don't corrupt his story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported Hill.
"He asked me to keep him secret and I kept him secret as he requested."
But his remarks seemed to be unacceptable by the president, who commented during the rest of the Saturday night: "I will tell you, it's a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense against the Great Judge, who became known as the sexual abuse of three women, the influential president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo made use of charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power in various ways.
You see evil, shameless, they don't care who they hurt, which they have to walk for power and control," Mediaite report on the president's statement.

The heavy rains continued to destroy the area and many of the areas around the city of Palu.
But after his friends fled for their safety, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at a heavy driving stand in the Sis Al-Jufri Mutiara Bandar, Palu.
She chose to stay and make sure that the 6321st Batik Air Force, then located in a remote port, was able to safely cross the border.

Unfortunately, we lost this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We all regret hearing this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities were concerned about the death of thousands of victims after the National Court of Human Rights had given them access to the cities of Dodhya, Sigi and Botong.
"The victim's confidence will continue to grow because many victims still suffer in order and many others cannot be reached," said the national team spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves that reach six meters have made the wooden wooden floor that causes the massive burial on Sunday.

Micronesian plane crash: Niugini Air brings one person to death after an accident
The airport operating on the Pacific Coast of Micronesia reported that one person had lost his flight, after being contacted by 47 passengers and that the crew had been safely evacuated from a deep plane.
The river Niugini reported in a letter on Saturday morning that it was impossible to identify a man by his side.
The prosecutor said his party had worked with the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The host does not quickly respond to his request for more details about the host, such as his age or his citizenship.
Local aircraft help save the other crew crew, after the plane crashing while trying to get into Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, seven people were brought to the hospital.
The passengers delivered the remaining six passengers to the sick on the Sabbath, and they all were in good condition.
What has led to disaster and a series of events yet to take place is not fully understood.
Both U.S. seafarers and seafarers report landing on the coast around the coast.
Several witnesses felt that the plane was crossing the railways.
American citizen Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to tap the high-end water through the exit door on that deep plane.
He offered to deal with the shock and anxiety of his family and friends.
The U.S. sea level says the crew working close to the improved coast also helps rescue the use of a carrot boat to take people to the countryside before an inland plane within 30 metres (100 ft) in water.
Data from the Flight Safety Network indicate 111 people have died in the crash of the PNG registration disaster for the last two decades but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyticals provide a line of time for night women burned alive.
An investigation of the fate of a man who was accused of burning his life for a Mississippi woman in 2014 revealed that he had been murdered on the Sabbath.
The analysis of the AS Department of Justice Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a huge list of legal cases on how he used his cell phone records to gather all the events that were reported on in Quinton Tellis and his 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared with what was said earlier, announced by Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the suspect's cell phone was on a spot with Chambers during that time, he was arguing that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the agenda on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the event.
When the investigator asked Tellis to be honest when he said that he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies reported by Tellis are his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks to the death of the victim.
The telephone records show them dating back to the first century.
Rowlett reported that after the death of Chambers, sometimes Tellis deleted messages, calls and contacting Chambers' information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," said Hale.
The ceremony was scheduled to begin its final announcement on Sunday.
The judge said that he was hoping that the trial would go a long way toward the trial.
The High Breed: What's the excitement of the hip hop?
A group of trio hip hops want to resist the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.

The other black guy?!
The NYPD demands a couple because of the attack after issuing a "racial" message.
A New York police officer asked a couple because they had been discriminated against after receiving messages from a mother who complained and said she was "the other black man."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and they thought it was more like "smart."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed her maturity when she realized that the nurse of the new child, Giselle Maurice, was black as she worked her first day in 2016.
"APPLY SOME MAN HITAM LAINNYA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, as soon as she sent it to her husband, she even sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
After acknowledging his mistake, the "ungood" Plato-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, saying they had issued an order, which was an African-American peasant, because he had done a very bad job and he looked forward to the Philippines, based on the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid one day for her work and then used Uber as a nurse.
Now, Maurice asked the couple to make compensation for this writing, and asked for a compensation of about $350 a day for six months, as a reward for the first job she had to work without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," he said to the Post on Sunday, and then he added, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple opposed the clarinets who said they were racist, said that Maurice's job was something to be done, and they were worried they couldn't believe it after it got over it,
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Posters.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've met, though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As in the "circumcision," the wife of Plasco said that just two months she gave birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going to pursue someone in such a condition?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment bank added.
While the legal case was under way, the court of the public opinion quickly threatened the couple’s social media, accusing them of their attitude and logic.
Paddington's reporters worry readers won't get involved in the conversation, the new message is filled.
His daughter, Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after his book was received, explained in a letter. "It's hard to just talk without knowing what his position was, to read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know how we know about the great Paddington crash."
Telling his father, who was a BBC camera before inspirationing through the book of children with toys, which was very optimistic about the outcome of his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book that was considered "pahit manis" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proud at the end of his life.
"He's a very quiet man, and he's not a proud man," she said.
"But since Paddington is very important to him, it's like you have a son who's got something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter's in pain and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the time of her death, her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad makes a call calmly to make it very bad, that he'll probably not survive," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I received a call from Nad, who said he was going to die in the cave for two minutes, and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors have given her to keep her heart on moving forward and leaving her body system.
He died a few years ago when the design process ran out and everything was going to die.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this is covered.
I can't walk, or cry or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to keep it all."
Finally, Miss Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving about the loss of her daughter, riding on a plane with the other passengers -- not knowing what she's been through.
"No one knows her," she said.
"My head is down and my eyes are stuck all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but when I'm on that plane, I feel so deep compassion for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Women who are grieving wear cards to prevent suicide in the gates
Two women who lost their loved ones in death tried to escape from a life of suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put cards in a door in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted to get support.
Miss Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started to suffer depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any adults who feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Sydney, says that his son was a coke who promised with a smile that ran away.
"Everyone knows her from her smile.
They're always saying that his voice spreads out."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, 11 - year - old Tyler found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm still worried if there's any further effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to let people know that there's someone else out there you can approach and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who spent years with Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was in his lowest position on the Day of Resurrection when the children opened their gifts. He did not see them, nor did he see them.
He said that his death was a big tragedy for them, but they had to go through it, "Is it a family problem?
It divides us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking -- a limited investigation of his time, limited by his impact -- we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the committee "damaged" in the middle of the building's decision.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They have all come true for you.
The legislator stayed for five more weeks, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republic did, they would be too weak to allow those who wanted to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, protecting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who is a private secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the president, to determine his victory and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Percentage of North Korea's 'on-line' under Kim
Hundreds of people who fled North Korea to South Korea have been sent to the tragedy since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, a South Korean parliament member died.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from South-South integration benchmark data, said there were 1,127 surveys last year -- compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the control of the border between North Korea and Tiongkok and the higher tariffs that people's fraud has caused is the key factor.
Pyongyang doesn't give a public comment.
Most refugees from the North were eventually granted asylum in South Korea.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the caves through Tingkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two of Korea.
Tingokok treated refugees illegally and often forced them to flee.
The relationship between the North and the South has continued to grow dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the alleged decentralization negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on the nuclear-weapon-free Korean occupation.
But on the Sabbath, North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. Sanctions for a lack of development since then.
"As long as we believe in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in this situation, we will not be able to put down our weapons separately," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the PBB General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hissteris," he said it was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
The head of Nancy Pelosi's opposition accused High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of "histeris" and said that he was not suitable for serving at the High Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday speech at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid the idea that if a woman was so active, they would say 'hissteris'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Jewish Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally argues that he has made sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times he cried and had difficulty talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also falsely accused Democrats of the committee, saying that he was accused of "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton was missing in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was used to democracy.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrats," he said.
The prosthesis said it's prudent if he's going to try to argue if he's accepted, and if the Democrat gets more voice in the Rakyat's House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't say what he really said to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he's now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
The professor added that he was a Democrat who was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision on the Health Service Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative figure.
In the office extension congregation, Kavanaugh avoids questioning whether he will reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for someone who's hysterical and normal to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's great,' says Pelosi.
And women need to give it to her.
It's an ethical joke, anger for months and years, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry: Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, what do you think?"
He went on, "I'm very helped by a woman who's executive in some place, who says she's also crying when she's angry, but developing a technique that means she's angry and she's starting to cry, she'll tell the person who's talking to her, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The water of the eye is released as a way out of part of anger because it on the basis of which it is perceived.
One of my strongest memories of my early work, at a man-dominated office, when I cried out in unexpressed rage, was that of an older woman who was a cold manager who was always a little scared of me.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Colorado convention, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential office.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-house marriage on a plane called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, realizing that he had no reason for not joining himself as president.
"It's not a mature decision," she said to me 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "Seven and Seven Squads."
Because it's late in the campaign, he's staying in the middle of the stage, and so he swears he won't follow the election unless he's able to collect two million dollars.
It's a battle that leads to victory.
He found that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to the man just gave him $250.
"What do they think I got a discon?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not destroy the formal campaign, he was so dominated by emotions--thanks to those who supported him, frustration with a system that makes it so difficult and to slow down the choice of delegations, and anger over sexism-- making him difficult to talk.
"You may think that I'm too nervous," exclaimed Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacts to him.
"You'll think that Klenex is my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my nose?
"It's crying?"
How the AS-Tiongkok business may be good for Beijing
The opening of a deal between the US and Tingkok is so exciting, and while the war is far from over, the confrontation between the two countries may have benefited Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, shot the first warning this year by making a raid on Tingkok's key export goods, including solar panels, copper and aluminium.
A very significant achievement has been made this week with a new price that affects goods at $200 billion (£150 billion), with an effective handling of half of all goods entering the United States through Tiongkok.
Beijing has paid every time, recently rateing up to five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
Tingkok has asked to celebrate the United States alone, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
To tell Washington to turn around means to follow the lead, but publicly telling the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the US business pressure can support Tingkok positively in the long run by reducing the gap between the two economies.
"The fact that fast political decisions by Washington or Beijing can make economic movements in both countries even more dangerous than what has been known before," researcher Abigail Grace, an Asian-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a specialist.
Syria 'prepared' for refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says that they are ready for refugee exile and offer help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to Majelis General PBB, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem says that the situation in his country improves.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and secure and the blessings of progress in combating terrorism," she said.
The government continues to enable the areas destroyed by terrorism to restore it as if it were repeated.
All conditions are now present because refugees return voluntarily to the country where they have to leave because of terrorism and economic decisions that involve their daily lives and their faces as goals.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced from their homeland since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million others who still live in that country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a corrupt country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any assistance or conditional assistance from the countries supporting the rebels.
Europe ensures the victory of the Ryder Square in Paris
The European team has won the Reuters team with final score 16.5 and 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six rounds in Europe and has not won the Ryder Square in Europe since 1993.
Europe got back on track when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Astrologers Phil Mickelson, who was trying almost all over the tournament, hit his tea box into water on 16th floor par-3, admitted his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf athlete Molinari shines around his round, becoming 1 of the 4 players who have had 5-0-0 since the format that took place in the tournament began in 1979.
The American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5&4 lower-ranking European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 over Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in the last Ryder Palace.
An eight-year-old ryder, Sergio Garcia from Spain, became a European with a total of 25.5 careers in this tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I can't hold it today.
It's a hard year.
Thank you very much for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy, very happy to get her way back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He gave his responsibility to his fellow national John Ram who won the league golf player AS Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The amazing surprise I thought, defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost in his four competitions in France and now has 13-21-3 records of the Ryder Piala career.
Strange statistics by one of the best players all the time, have won 14 main titles only under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought for the weekend to get a fairy with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf all over the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the irony disappointed his team, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There was this morning when we crossed Europe.
We're fighting.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players play very well.
We're going to call back, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Board of Directors and we're going to make progress.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to give honor.
We're lost."
