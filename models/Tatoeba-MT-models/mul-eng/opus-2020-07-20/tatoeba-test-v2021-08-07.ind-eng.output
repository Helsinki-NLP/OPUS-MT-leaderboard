I pushed Mary into the water.
I met my old friend.
I read the label.
I realize what I've chosen isn't making me curious.
I really just wanted to go.
I love your hair.
I really need your help.
I refused.
I had refused to invite him to eat at night.
I remember hearing a very similar story.
I remember watching the movie
It's like I've seen you somewhere.

I saw it in a magazine.
I saw them walking together.
I saw them yesterday.
I saw the red light.
I saw Tom and Mary walk together.
Then I saw Tom.
I saw Tom in the lobby.
I saw you riding across my house this morning.
I've seen you with his high body boy.
I said this from the heart.
That's what it's like.
I don't think Tom needs to do that.
Is everything okay?
I have to ask, right?
I'd better cancel my trip to LA.
I have to go home before my parents get worried.
I shouldn't blow that red light.
I have to read that book.
He's a little angry like that.
I showed my friend to him.
I got drunk one day.
I don't even understand this at all.
Is this love?
Is it just a coincidence that "banality", when it's scheduled, read "Italian"?
My call?
Is it raining?
You're right?
Is that true?
Didn't Tom say that?
I understood two different languages.
I spent too much time in front of my computer.

I'm still home because the rain is falling.
Is that true!
Is that true!
Is that true?
Is that right?
Is that the map we've been looking for for for so long?

Is there something you want to know?
Is there anything you want to ask me?
Is this a coincidence?
Is this a declaration of war?
This book belongs to you?
Is this where your mother works?
Is this water good for drinking?
Is this the first time you went abroad?
I haven't heard from him yet.
I haven't learned to drive a car yet.
I still think Tom is guilty.
What's wrong with Tom?
How's Tom?
I stood here for 30 minutes.
I learned hard to pass tests.
I've learned your religion, but I don't like it.
I learned English and Japanese.
I've learned math very carefully, as long as I've learned English.
I think back to the things we had to do, there were things we wanted to do...
I thought he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I thought there was someone who was entering the bedroom.
Is your house far?
Is your mother home?
What's your bedroom?
I'm talking about clothes with Aki.
Italy is the most beautiful country.
Looks like he's changing his mind.
It could be dangerous for a young man to drive a motorcycle.

The rain continued to fall until the day was full.
It's gonna burn.
Looks like there's a elevator around there.
The joy that we have is not compared to the joy that comes from giving of ourselves.
Maybe it'll rain.
Anger doesn't benefit anything.
I told Tom some jokes.
I told Tom that I thought it was a good idea.
I told Tom to stop.
I told Tom we could do it today.
I've already told you to keep the lights off.
I've told you that the group is going to be boring.
I was wrong to take your shoulder.
The rain didn't stop until one day.
Get down in the woods.
I've translated, I'm translating, I'm going to translate... but only if I get money.

"It's been a long time since I didn't drink milk from the bottle." "Yes, I don't know why it feels better than that on the cardboard?" "I think so."
It's cold.
It's hard to talk to him.
It feels like a dream to me.
Looks like it'll waste time if we wait longer.
It seems that there was no one in the house.
It's apparently written with rap.
It's totally out of your mind.
Just like what you say.
That's what's up to you.
Learning about this foreign culture was fun.
It's getting worse.
A little more rain will fall.
This conclusion is difficult to draw.
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's very important to read books.
It's impossible.
It's like one of those things.
It's my only hope.
It's my boat.
That's what the law needs.
We must do this by diligently studying the Scriptures and doing our best to make sure that we are firmly resolved to apply what we learn.
