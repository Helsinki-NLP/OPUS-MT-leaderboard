What are you doing? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or sugar?
The new main city of ČSSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their ODS senior colleagues in the Persian Council and in its representative capacity.
Daník Currently.cz members of the new board from ČSSD "tested", as they know the notorically introduced slogan that has occurred at the workshop over the past few years when Prague ruled the current co-heroes.
The codified dictionary, which the Persian politician introduced during the previous era of Prime Minister Paul Béma, describes some of the most famous positions, situations, and causes in the Metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new idea of work is not very clear.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prague's politics more novelty," he responded to the test of "Cmotrovian" dictionary working for the culture of Lukáš Kaucký.
And in the case of a political veteran, he reacted similarly to the work of Karel Brézin.
It's supposed to be a golf course.
"It's the only expression you're suggesting to me that I use sometimes."
"I don't usually know how to smile."
From the dictionary, which is now published this year in June before the ODS elections, she chose six examples, mostly those that are notorically connected with the Prague Magistrate.
The socialists were supposed to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "the biggest golf course in Prague", "to get to the sugar shop", "to the beach", "to the capital city" and "to make up".
Three of the workers agreed with the show, fourth - Antonín Weinert, who has a future head of the Prague school - first introduced the conversation, later on, but no phone.
The five working Peter Dolínek refused the same test.
"I'm not going to solve these things at all, and I'm not going to appreciate the way that democracy is dealing with it."
"I'm now going to figure out how we're going to understand our programs," he replied.
As already noted, the work of Luke Kaucký would clearly not recognise in the title that it is the case of the influential businessman and friend of the expresstor Béma Romanu Janoušk.
"Voldemort" doesn't tell him anything, and the only term he had in the test right is "the bigger golf course in Prague."
"It's a White tunnel," says Kaucky, and now he adds, "but I know it better than the news."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf course then as a tunnel Blanca handles not only the matador Karel Brézina, but also works for the living environment of Lukáš Plachy.
Both social democracies then know who is really Voldemort, and Lukaši Plachém is known and where to find this position - the meaning of the expression "go to sugar".
"This means going to some Persian company," is a nearby solution that concerns the seat of the Janous companies.
In line with Bresin, he recalled that knowledge was more valuable to the news than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test frequency, there is no similar run-off dictionary of slogans.
"I've been working with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like this."
"We say more names, sometimes shorts and confused names," says the Prussian president of the ČSSD Petr Hulinski, whose guests are surprised by Hulda.
"I've been told by Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," she admits to her own viewer, Karel Brezin.
The current.cz name has tried and works.
Weinert's board is for the guests of Santa or less a friend of Santa Claus, representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned himself before the elections in sponsoring the party, has in some colleagues a preview of "Player".
The visions are also the only ones that social democracies have in their own national language.
Huldu's Hullin's spring doesn't like to hear it, but the daily Actually.cz noted another glimpse of this Persian president.
"Doctor of the Law of the Bishkek" recalls that Petr Hulinski received his title JUDr. at the Bratislav police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of the witch, issued a brochure
Women reported in Burkina Faso as witches have several common signs.
Patrios are older generations, they can't get involved in work, for example for health reasons, they're free and they don't have children.
The one who becomes a monster is sent to isolation so that she does not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man's only gonna get this sentence very tight."
"Not even young healthy women are represented because they help with work and children," says a series of sisters in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, more than a hundred women who have grown up in their communities.
The local government has now decided to put an end to an unusual "social measure".
She has issued an information brochure that should help her to limit her spell.
But he's got a knife.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warned the newspaper Die Standard.
The charge of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, where Burkina Faso is a neighbor, two decades ago, Ammy Hemma died after her three women and two men were tortured, burned with oil and burned.
The BBC server reported the case.
The prosecutors claim that there was an unfortunate finding of the situation.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual washing was poured on women.
He burned what the group wanted from the woman "to expel the evil spirit".
Isolations of "miracles" support people regardless of the level of education they have achieved.
Daník Der Standard quoted a 20-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The fires of human souls were always dangerous," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to make peace with the queen, the president in Gambia took part in last year.
"The Gambian President Jammy, after his aunt's death, spoke to a large witch who was evidently supposed to share her death and try to help the black magic kill the president himself."
"With the help of a boat from nearby Guinea, which, for police, soldiers and the personal protection of the president, forced the elected men and women from the Gambian villages to the farm in Canilai," said Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, people had to drink a medicine containing allucinogenic effects, which further caused cancer and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
At the end of the international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were released.
Balalow renter: Topi in stones, higher rent signed
The oldest underlying man was driven from the door of the client centre of the RPG apartment "uholi" Zdenňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech.
Under his care, he sent a new contract to three rooms: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the sentence.
All three just deregulators raised the rent.
Instead of 3500 months, the son will be paid for the next year by 2+1 second category 4400 kroner.
"And there's no hot water there and the top must be peppers (the stone on the silent fuel, Mr. Red.)," the man indicates his finger in his son's new contract, whose signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half negative.
BytyOKD.cz, the Civil Society, which has marked the new terms as "inaccurate and unfair", recommends that employers not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December when public guidance on how to deal with them.
But the man's only got his hand on it.
"One says it, the other it is," he whispers.
It's going to become a big deregulatory lab.
After the New Year, he is waiting for a large majority of the apartments in the Czech Republic that still have a non-profit rent.
Currently.cz decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
The RPG waiter is one of the four in Ostravsk and is already full on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m.
Right next to the door there is a security agency and an alarming device.
"Im 2011" lights a special button on his touch screen.
There's a piece of paper coming out of the machine with a number.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already on the big screen under the waiting cover.
You're on the line in half a second.
After a while he comes to the house to ask an older couple, he is in wait, but the new ones are obviously not.
Most people have come to solve common problems, such as requests for correction, certain events, and so forth.
Letters with new rental contracts are sent to Ostravsk to the postal registers of most of the 44 thousand apartments of RPG portfolio from mid-November.
RPG Bytes in letters proposes an increase of 15 to 38 per cent.
The special obstacle to new rentals was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It runs over a week, so it's first in the race," the workers respond to a pause after a moment of action when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deregulatory and Balalow former Hortic apartments are a local subject of excitement.
Before the elections, he was received by the local president of Parliament and the island's cousin Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD, and now local newspapers are filled.
"Two years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even replaced me on the desk," says the man mentioned at the outset.
At the very least, according to the employer, pensioners are coming to make sure that they will get a discount from the loan if they sign the time the RPG in the special offer promises them.
Half-way rents will also be awarded to other tenants who sign the new contract by 15 December.
Javier's "deregulatory" surplus, but questions are definitely not locked up.
"There were only about forty-five people from 360 customers here for the 2011 rent yesterday," the staff estimate was too late.
In addition to the website and its settings, RPG proposes an individual meeting of the contract where it will be needed.
However, if both parties disagree on the rent, they will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not about threats, but about information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG warns on its pages.
"No one will judge here," says one of the employees of RPG Bytes, and the man on the street before the client centre gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13 thousand breaths and I'm left with five thousand food, I don't have to handle it," he says.
But the staff will only be able to find out.
"See you."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he says.
The lease regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, it is economic necessity to increase them.
"The existing rental still does not meet even more necessary for the free maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimès, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Bytes, that the real estate of the housing fund is, according to the owners' main reason for the increase in loans.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest in four billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
A large screen attached to the ceiling against the pulstrowed satacies of the Havrian waiting room is still covering a number of reddished information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less relates to 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it's always going to be more than 7.50 Kč per metre of four and a month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from RPG portfolio will be rented by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, one is raised from an extremely low of 19.66 Kč per square metre," warns the RPG.
The next year, 2600 apartments will remain the same.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulatory will not be able to rent easily, but will be distributed to four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from raising the rent (see graph) gives the company back to the apartments, especially in warm support - new windows and heating.
They have to get people who sign an agreement to raise loans.
To the office belongs to the school, they understand the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is a new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
No one would expect to hide a mini-colon with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, impressive furniture, buying toys and even a miniatur garden on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of the Arch.Design can visit her.
The Arch.Design project-architectonic company, whose workshops took a number of significant fire buildings, counted with the space for its company miniscule already from the first exhibitions of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people primarily in the baby's age and is concerned that women projectors and architects can get back to work quickly.
Together with the opportunities for short-term views, the school is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under the social program.
The manufacturers and architects have the opportunity to include special jobs with child care.
The Ministry designed the Arch.Design staff themselves and, with the support of leadership, managed to get the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs grants.
The Ministry of Enterprise is funded from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment and the National Budget of the CR.
Thanks to the grant funding (appropriate of 2,8 million Kč) they were able to buy equipment and equipment and to ensure a qualified staff and service within two years.
After the cancellation of the financial contribution (2 years), Arch.Design has the responsibility to carry out a minicycle at its own cost for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and the application for a grant significantly helped the Economic Rating company.
Péchi ensures a qualified staff, a nurse and a teacher of the MS will spend the whole day caring for the children, so children can go to school without age limitations, although most of them are 3 years old.
Because it's about "minisculating", there can be only five children at the same time, but it's going to get worse during the day.
School performance is flexible as required by parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchical position in the company.
Despite individual training and care, the programme supplement in the mini-school is comparable to the pre-school education framework programme.
The children are not only playing here, but they are also assured of the quality of education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school courses, they also learn English.
The class is equipped not only with toys, entertainment games, but also with computers that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may at any time check their children and give up stress with the late delivery of children from schools away from their parents ’ workplace.
Parents thus use their working time more productive.
It's not surprising that there's naturally a loyal relationship between an employee - an employee.
Arch.Design has thus organised a Czech company that offers significant benefits in the collection of new employees, are friends to the family and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house from the coast is also fascinating for 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudí.
The glass looks like the back of the real ice cream, the pastry of the dinosaura, and the balconies are open to the fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local houses, he served as a house from the coast with his organic design.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of bones and brains, fassada reminiscent of soups and all manner of soft wheat, it is all typical of Antoni Gaudí's set.
The next house plays dreams, tasteful colors and textures that remind us of nature and animals.
In detail, it is to see geometry, rhythm, and precisely thought order.
During the night, the entire phase of the house appears even more dramatic, it is enhanced so that it can be even more comfortable to learn a light color.
It is also evident in the interior that the bending and bending of the shapes is the same as in the interior.
The tree in the valleys is copied by a branch of the branch, a slender, attractive furniture of the door, a kitchen and a bed.
The house Batló, located in the fourth Eixample on the Russian shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43, was built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, wealthy industrialist Joseph Batló, originally continued to build old buildings and build a whole new one, shortly before he adopted Gaudí's idea of unusual and lighter construction.
The Chinese house of Casa Batló, but Antoni Gaudí didn't build it on his own.
He worked with the architect Joseph Maria Jujol.
Right on his projective finger, the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of property and the use of the brains on the phase.
She's been working at the stage with a number of other artists and artists.
The joint work on the house plans of Casa Batló started with the successful cooperation of Jujola with Gaudí.
Jujol took part in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Mila and Güell's park, where there are other Gaudí's works.
From the local homes of interest after completion, he served thanks to his organic form of the view of the "House of the bone".
Others, because of a specific window opening mechanism, began to call it a "dwelling house".
It is also said that at the top of the building, the sword of holy Jiré, the patron of Catalánska, has been compared.
Hidden religious motives also include other sugary properties of the building.
Gaudi has proposed at his time a unique central heating system with air conditioning and typical compartments.
The birch can seem to be a quarter of their five-degree shield.
At the time of Gaudí’s creation, he had absolutely no respect for those building regulations and refused to join them.
At the start of the construction, the building had received a construction permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so serious that two years later, the city council was damaged by the result and requested the adjustment.
For example, the building was covered by pillars and into the public corridor.
In contrast, only fifteen days after the mayor’s election, Joseph Batló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the highest houses.
The owner himself moved to lower floors.
In the gallery in the second floor there was a social salon and a third floor room and a private part of the apartment.
The territory was located in cloning.
The entire six-storey house is surrounded by a warehouse that can be set up on the same roof terrace.
The main components of the obstacle were the destruction of all the right lines and direct lines and their replacements with walled walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of proposing space.
The opening of the hall can be entirely open, and a larger company can communicate freely with each other without being able to keep the details needed for further discussions.
In addition to the new phase, the house with Gaudí was built with a non-traditional solution and two roofs more.
It also enables Gaudí to play with light, blue and white-smoothed curtains, which are fitted with inner doors and lamps.
The game gives two colors to the maximum light in all patterns of the house.
It was simply enough to establish the principle that white light reflects more light than darkness, which the sun’s wings do not glow.
The Casa Batló house, which was set up in 2005 for the World Heritage Fund Unesco, can be visited by everyone.
In the first floor of the house is the most spacious and dignified place to be available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous face.
They continued to visit because they found out that it was a very useful business, and they also expanded the areas of joint and underground, including wind terraces.
The entry into the memory is definitely not inevitable, making 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist crews have a twenty-percent discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of the entrance to other Gaudí building in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with the expensive candles, you need to get in touch with one of the Chinese residents and visit him directly at home.
How to choose matrices and plants: Women have other requirements than men
They've never built a massive frame, but the quality of the flesh surfaces, so matrices and plants, they're giving the foundation a really good bed.
It must also be complemented by harmonics to express themselves to specific users.
In the selection, he decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status, and sex of the owners.
Also important is the type of interior to which the matrices and plants grow.
A typical example?
Maybe on weekend chalupes where they don't get regular, they're not suitable latex matrices because they're less "burning".
Moreover, they have a significantly higher volume than standard polyurethane matrix.
At the same time, it is necessary to turn them around regularly.
If they don't have a lot of breathing channels in the core, while still lying on a fixed surface, they keep the fluid under them: they could even reveal the fluid below them.
The choice also determines the practice.
Anyone who has spent a long time abroad, often using a lot of high matrices with a refreshing variety, will find it difficult to feel well on the low and hard surface.
"Mostly all hockeys who have returned from NHL have complained to me that they won't sleep here."
"On their hardened shoulders, legs and sides, the matrices needed a refreshing kind of pine line."
"These are recommended for people with diabetes who have a breakdown of the nervous system, so they misread "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Haddamčík, who specializes in the damaged apartment.
A lot of hockeys, but other customers, that's why a couple of years ago, the matrices with a line of bread.
"Today it's okay, the appropriate matrice needs Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropical."
You don't have to be a fighter from NHL to evaluate the line of bread.
It's just that "scream" works.
Optimize your noise and shape according to absorbed heat or adapt to your warm body.
It's okay with you, you won't be turned around at night as hard as you can.
Just get better sleep.
The line line also works as a protection against crossings.
When selecting the size of the matrices to your height, add the length of the walk, which is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm so need bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm double, then 180 cm together.
In individual beds, such as singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For a convenient and possible visit.
"This is a rule for a wide bed simple: when lying on the back, you should have your hands gently bent in the back," says Ing. Helena Prokopo, Cechu's Cechus, and Decorator, who has been struggling with sleep and ergonomics for several years and presents it to professional schools.
In the double box, you need every plant and matrice, but here you are careful when buying to imitate high matrices.
Otherwise, it will not encourage anything other than mounting growth to different heights, however, it must not be done in any frame.
Iron matrices should have a minimum height of 14 cm, types with a supply layer of at least 15 centimetres from which you can count at least three centimetres to form and shape.
"When it comes to the hand or touch the matrices, you must not feel the gift," warns Helena Prokop.
Each matrice requires a certain type of growth.
The whole bed, when the matrices and the floor are like adult silk doubles, has nothing to do with the bedrooms.
The matrices are in a bad mood, they can't figure out their tracks, which is already common today.
And since we usually spend 0.2 to 0.75 l a day in the night, it is clear that after five to seven years of matrices will start to remember one big (and buried) network.
Therefore, experts reject advertising reports on life for up to 25 years or even life assurances.
But everything has its own.
And that's why advice from the sellers' practice: with a width of 120 or 140 cm hygienic and work not to give a photographable score, but add a better matrix screen, which you can easily catch and extract.
Although matrices are usually produced throughout the course today, so we get two parts (for sleep and the size of the practice is very important!), although manipulation in larger types (and in one person) could be a memory of the easy weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a hard desk in bed?
Never!
At least on bed for one night's visits.
However, take the board (if it has no more) windscreens and use the matrices with a supply layer and a minimum height of 15 cm with a supply in the bags (with it.Tashchenfederkern) and a type of cypress.
Polyurethane matrices on such a base do not belong.
For non-industrial lamela plants 14 to 18 lamelas will be suitable latex or sandwich matrices (needs to combine latex and coconuts), but you will always pay for the growth with a larger number of lamela, 28 and more where lamelas in the bender area are doubled and their noise can be regulated.
Lamela plants do not appear to be matrices with the supply layer because they do not respond to the deposition.
According to the configuration of the lammel, it can also be accessed by the shoulder wheel.
It's about a special cut-off of the needle that allows you to push or even push the needle so that the shoulder is "crushed".
For men who have "the ramen all over the back," a very important thing.
In fact, it is even remembered by the matrices producers who started using the fading zone right in the area of the shoulder.
Women also remember - they also bring the soft surface into the wheelchairs.
For the most annual customers, creamed or distilled plants with so-called multi-torous measurement are determined.
The pressure is divided into more points and reduced to fuel.
However, when you use the right matrice and the growth of the wrong polar bear (large and "inflated"), most "plus" disappear.
The basic rule is simple: a policeman must support his head and stick only to the shoulders in order to release the shoulder straps.
The appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which prefers, for example, Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the powder should be equal to the height of the shoulder (spouse with an arm belt or a soft edge in a matrix) of the shoulder.
Modern matrices have only one thing in common with the original strawberries filled with grass.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least direct.
The trend was just like he was in his matrices.
The raw materials made of polyurethane beans are replaced by natural oils, such as sugar and soybean.
They're using almost all known manufacturers.
"It was in matrice means that the core was made of pure natural origin material," explains Petr Vasžiček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of matrices, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can even touch the microcapsule to allow you to clean the freshness of the forest or the lavender.
There are also divisions for men and women.
While a man's "goes" a plant extract from the chest to absorb heat and cool the body, the woman's "top".
The extract from red peppers increases the circulation of blood, so it's a weaker sex of heat.
Today's favorites?
The matrices made of a study pen (with larger pores with a damaged bone structure, are so much more common than the common polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of the different noises of the study pins and the "lines" pens create multiple-zone matrices that know exactly where to be heads, bedras and potatoes.
For quality matrices, you will pay from seven thousand crowns and heights.
Those who meet the health parameters have a lower rate of DPH, are protected as health aid.
As the first to arrive in the Czech Republic for this benefit, Gumotex.
Four on the matrice and growth isn't easy.
Sometimes the shares of manufacturers or sellers who offer two matrices at the same price may be used.
Maybe the Magniflex sign offers Duofreze matrices with all memory memory for 11 990 kroner.
The other can still be held free.
Eru of lines or viscolastic pines with open bongo structure and high frequency began with the "cosmic" temperature of Tempur material.
It was originally produced as a material for NASA because at the beginning, astronomers were exposed to enormous burden.
The temperature in the hot milk, in the cold, on the contrary.
The warm human body is thus perfectly adapted and optimised by its pressure.
That's why it's perfect against the noise of the swimming pool, but it's also for raising the comfort while sleeping.
Viscolastic pens are used not only for matrices but also for medical products, which need special powders under feet that relieve the foot and the digestive system.
Turkish producers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver as well.
People's monitoring devices want the more parents want to watch their children
Fear of owning a child leads more and more people to the idea of monitoring through the GPS.
The system originally created for car patrol can also monitor people's movement and therefore help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year Anicky Janatka.
The device is still about as big as a cheese box, soon but it can only be as big as an hour.
A lot of people were afraid of the lost Anička case and began asking for the means to protect their children better.
And for the price of ruining their privates.
"We are trying to tell everyone that there is no savings, but another means of reducing the likelihood of some tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I accept that in certain cases it may be possible to use such devices, perhaps if they are given to someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't remembered the case yet."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose "crabik" serves and how it is used in the case of necessity.
Dana Bočk’s child psychologist warns that if the child doesn’t want to wear anything like that, he just gets rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how some things are willing to lose if they don't want to be under control."
"Many expectations have been raised earlier by parents of mobile phones, which are still able to run the same way as this tracking device," Bočkova says.
It also argues that if an attack is to be carried out, such a device would actually help.
"When it comes to a prepared egg, the nurse will always make sure that the child has no electronics that could betray his position."
"Now it's a phone."
"When they start to expand tracking devices, they will also look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always take a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it is assumed that a similar device may help in the event of an ongoing attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čecha from the RC Monitoring company, which offers monitoring services both for cars and for people, even when it comes to immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The device may be set to regularly transmit the position after a specified time."
"If it comes to his injury, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Serving devices have built up and canals, so even if a person just broke down and remained unmovable, the device will issue an immediate warning with the impact of the position," says Czech.
According to him, a similar service can also carry smart mobile phones with navigation, where there is enough to play special software.
The problem of the current tracking units is that it is related to devices similar to those of the size of the cells or smaller mobile phones.
It's always so dangerous to lose them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why now testing devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This will be the greatest benefit of the fact that the attacker does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he's known for some time and can give the police more time," he adds.
As soon as the tracking devices are made into frames or bars, they will continue to use the same technology as it is used for the monitoring of vehicles.
It is a combination of finding positions through the GPS system (which is used by regular auto navigation) and the functions of the mobile phone, which indicate the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a fire-fighting knife to surround Czechs, but it's only two years old.
The Czech army has made 445 miles of snow, which is the main source of fuel.
The Ministry of Defence had already added 224 kilometres of snow to the stocks.
The military has resources for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of the snow is two, maximum four years.
The army bought fuel from the STV Group, a total of 40 million dollars.
The general state of the purchase of such a large number of MF DNES fuel pumps reported that soldiers consume 60 km of fuel each year during training.
However, the number of military pyrotechnics mentioned by MF DNES appears to be a very intensive pyrotechnic training that would have to be conducted every year by all generals, officers of command of the army, secretaries or inquisitors.
Minister of Defence Alexandra Vondru and the commander of the Vlastimila Picka army are not surprised.
It would only be possible to justify the annual military consumption of 60 kilometres of fuel.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, military resources would last for more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, the basic training of each new professional is more than two meters of impressive snow, as experts say, the army has provided - and with increased consumption of women or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
Brigadiers of the fast-paced attack have recently personally complained to Minister Vondra that they do not have nearly any weapons, so the shootings are limited because of the need for money.
He's not talking about the lack of a lower salary.
"And I don't think it's my head that they're buying so many cigarettes again from us."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as merchants try to respond," says business manager STV Group Jan Décký.
The Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek, causes hundreds of kilometres of goods purchased and that the army will have the resources of this "munice" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Thank you from the STV Group is only talking about four-year life of fire and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"At the perfect storage these four can be," says one of them, who, as a soldier because of the criticism of the army, does not want to publish a name.
After life's end, every munitions must be carefully tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers in life.
These tests are not free, however, and they're worth more money.
Another argument of the ministry is a multi-scaling drop of 445 kilometres of smoke.
"We stood at sixteen per cent less than a low supply of two hundred and forty-four kilometres," said the spokesman Pejšek, who said to the procurement ministers.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of explosives by police pyrotechnics who liquidate ammunition from the second world war or from the Soviet army does not exceed 1,500 metres in a few years.
And the police are always ordering only so many that the municipality will still need it before the end of life.
It was witnessed to her because of the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also get more advanced and even more reliable types of snakes.
The Ministry of Defence has already had significant difficulties with liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition since the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-hundred-and-a-half thousand Czech armies were preparing to surrender to Rhine.
Here, according to Czech Pyrotechnics, MF DNES has been working on this problem for a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old tanks that buy "lacino" today.
So far, I'm cutting off the contacts I've got with the competition.
The winner of the year's life competition helped Lukáši Pytloun to sell his hotel in French.
During the win of last year's competition, the 8-year-old entrepreneur Luke Pytloun from Liberce became a businessman.
His story of success is like a movie.
You like Pytloun's trip.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberci there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
In support of the foreign brigade and with the help of the bank loan, he bought a abandoned house with five apartments.
The fact that he was a third-year-old high school student back then was a big deal.
"The longer the difference between the quality and the price of living with us is not enough for me to do anything about it," says Luke Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment started to hire foreign workers.
All the profits were invested back into the house, which he gradually transferred to the pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, he has been able to open four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberci.
The most comfortable one of them was the modern four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another, same quality came to him.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in the Istrove in Tisse, where we have sold our French concept and other interests about the French of the Pytloun hotels are voting," says the Dutch biologist number one.
"And on the sale of the hotel's licence to run, the winner of the year's life competition was given a great deal," said Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberci and around.
"People knew me on the streets, often added extra gratuitously, and I have to say it was pleasant," she recalls.
Participation in the competition is strongly recommended to all who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win, every visit is good.
She says she's still getting rid of contacts and notifications she might never have gotten.
"I started dealing with some of the people I met with because of the competition, and I started to trade regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has affected so much to every employee.
And that he's got about seventy.
"I warn them of greater loyalty and pride to share in something that has gained public recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us."
"It's just my name has been extended to the front," says Luke Pytloun humbly today.
I wish my guests a better year than we had in Farmet.
Euphoria was rapidly affected by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the ultimate victory, Farmet has more time for herself.
For the first place in the last year's competition Vodafone Company, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Zžárský, came to the hotel in Slovenia for the first place in the year.
The jury then assessed the efforts he had made through the small tool industry in the Czech Skalici company with the steel works.
"I can say that the evaluation raised not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our awareness of the competition competition," says the London winner today.
At the beginning of the history of the firm Farmet was eager to do something useful.
And when the state offered Karl Žórské's father to rent a small department as a compensation for the communists' entertainment property, he did not long, refused a career at the company where he was working, and with some friends around his father, he put a company on the plastic outlet.
Soon thereafter, they began to specialize in olive oil lichens.
After 18 years, the largest producer of automatic lichens in central Europe became one of them.
More information and, between the independent public, the company has achieved success in competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to take the brand Farmet much better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate their cooperation with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Zžárskiy.
However, the full year was not in Farmet only in the meaning of euphoria from victory.
The evaluation was based on the economic results of the company by 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of the machine goods.
The crisis has intensified, which has not yet affected citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit the purchases of new machines and technologies.
"Of course, this situation hasn't even gone away from us."
"The markets closed by 40 percent, we had to limit the production and came to release," explains Karel Zžárski.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such non-population measures.
But things worked out, and the company kept winning, even though I was less than before the crisis.
However, as far as the Farm is concerned, the investment in research and development is concerned.
"We set up research and school environments, strengthened presentations at international fairs, obtained the main evaluations at home exhibitions," says Zžárski.
Everything proves that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them and the number of new employees.
"The new victory prefers a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Zžárský.
An investigation to remove unreasonable rules
The survey on Absurditu year is a fourth part of the business ranking.
Some unreasonable rules have already been lifted.
This year's next anniversary of the Absurdita survey was a duty to carry to the Office documents that are also available online to officials.
She decided that more than a third of the four thousand votes in favour.
For example, social security management required a paper issue from the trade register, even though its official could obtain it by two clicks of mouse.
Thanks to the poll, it's gonna change.
"The Czech social security management will not require the exit from the trade register at the time of the checks on payments of insurance," said ČSSZ Jana Buranů.
Welcome to all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in Czech are required to comply with, and that is not reasonable to break the meaning of Absurdita's annual competition.
This year, this is a fourth part of the business call organised by the European Commission and there is still growing public interest.
If about three thousand votes were taken by the votes of the voters this year, they were almost four thousand.
And it's not strange, the most diverse legal obligations that only serve to maintain business, we still have enough and enough.
"We need a list number of tax recognition sites in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Livers of the PRC.
In recent years, the simplification of the business becomes the declared goal of all governments.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving in particular.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic, in view of the business situation, has placed at point 74, which is eight times higher than the moon.
The Absurdita competition for the year was first announced in 2006 and held annually according to the same scenario.
An administrative and bureaucratic misunderstanding may be reported by any person from the depths of the seat to the end of the contest.
The website is available at www.firmaroku.cz Then the competition editor selects seven candidates for the "anti-cenna" and allows the public to vote in October via the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdita, who'll get the most votes won.
More than one hundred, more than 105 regulations and regulations were notified to the annual survey.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional salesmen and journalists.
For example, among the "finalists" competitions, there was a requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of the distance and speed lines be paid off cheaply, or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets should be reduced every two years.
The list of annual proposals is published on the competition pages.
The declaration of competition, which will always take place at the beginning of November in the Václav municipality in Prague, is part of the hacking process, which is part of a regular participation in political and social life.
This year, for example, in this dispute, Eva Freebod, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Livers of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot operate where the state of the crackdown on businessmen's feet, so my aim is to break down at least three dozen paragraphs each year, which today are just too complicated," Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek said.
The effort to destroy an unreasonable regulation does not appear empty.
In 2007, the largest number of people were required to report to the Authority three days prior to the establishment of a permanent place of service, to take a stand at the exhibition or to do so.
This obligation was removed by the new legislation.
The second most voted duty in 2007 which was notified to the Office of Work for its foreign staff of service within 30 days was removed by the law on a so-called green card.
And to the third of everything good.
In 2009, the regulation for physiotherapeutics became a major set of eyes, kidneys and two soft weights.
This was balanced in the annual report by the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator of waste.
The new category assesses corporate liability companies
Evaluations are ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
In this year’s fifth anniversary of the competition for economic news, the category is called the Responsible Company in 2010.
The message of this competition is the support of a reasonable and fair business.
"We would like to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support responsible companies," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, the company Vodafone, who is the auditor and the competitor as well as in the case of the rebel year competition.
For the first year of the year, this special sub-category of the Vodafone Company of 2010 was reported by companies that did not achieve this only long-term objective.
The experience of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although the object of its activities is one of the other diametrically similar, support and transparency may be considered to be the common denominator of their efforts.
In one case, for example, people who have been hit and others need personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Between the fourteenths of the general public finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams between employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubic country is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the trust fund for the benefit of children with disabilities for over seventy years.
A paper from Podrebrad, which has more than 70 per cent, is also old enough for its healthy employees, thus obtaining the title of the Central Bank’s Responsible Company and in the Vodafone Company’s competition for the year, was placed in the country as a third.
At Olomouk, the accountant MiRyz Soft, who launched a good working time, was even reduced to an average of 35 hours a week but without a moderately reduced salary.
The title of the jury also made it a priority to buy from Czech producers, to support civil activities in the immediate environment and to ensure that the environment is clean.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administration have at least the least impact on the environment," explains Director Milushe Ryzner.
The responsible IT Enlogit from Austria also thinks about the health of its employees and has arranged ergonomic seats and keyboards for each note to them, supporting their work from home and using the catering services provided by local protected personnel on their business activities.
"In addition, we support the dedication of a man in silence, which helps the local Roma community specifically," says the representative of the company Ondréj Suchi.
In the latter case, there is also a decline in the activity of the company Prania and cleaning from Karlovarsk region, which contributes to their pension insurance by its employees in the form of standard bonuses.
"We are also contributing to food, transport, increased qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the Czasch bruntal construction company, winner in the country of Morazkoslez.
The responsible company of the year was automatically notified to all countries of finalist competition Vodafone Company of the year, who responded to questions of the questionnaire attached to the report and sent it by 15 July at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete replies to the questionnaire were then listed by the editor.
"If the representatives of the competition firm did not answer the questions, the competitions could not participate in the year, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone Company of the year."
"It is not possible to submit to this competition alone, because it is a sub-categories of the company's main competition year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's managing agency.
On the ground fund in Plzni, the police attacked the public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzni, the anti-corruption police were attacked in the past days.
The search for detectives introduced local entrepreneurs in the media sector and dealers with the reality of Luboši G.
This was apparently trying to manipulate the current public competition to arrange the refund payments so that the land offered in the contest would receive a specific interest.
He was supposed to pay half a million dollars for it.
"I can only now confirm that the police are working for one person for the cause of war at public arrest and in public competition," said the Chief of Public Prosecutor's Law, Antonie Zelená, with further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Sixty-three-year-old police officers were released after 24 hours.
The extent to which the public competition could have been affected shall be limited to speculation of the minimum official information.
The spokesman of the Land Fund of Lubomír Montenegro, on the question of the Law, stated that the police were actually involved in a decided workshop in Plzni, and that was during public competition.
"It was about a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition is entitled "Requires for the provision of land transfer loans under the Land Act" and is conducted in case the land offered shows interest in more eligible applicants.
"These persons within the scope of the challenge offer a higher value of their refunds, which should be transferred before the land value has been declared."
"According to the tenders offered, the order of the buyers and the Land Fund will then transfer the land of the person who offered the highest wages," the speaker explained to the Fund.
Mr. Luboš G. obviously had information about who joined the call and because he was also a right-wing person, because he had bought a number of refund payments, he offered to the interested party that he was not participating in the competition.
He must've been throwing away that thing.
That would explain that he had so much money in custody.
Luboš G. had over-standard contacts on PF in Plzni in the past.
He identified in the case of former chief PF Václava Sankota, who was criminalized for issuing the land refund for which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
At that time, Luboš G. received, for example, a land designated for the construction of public communications, in particular in a place where an access master was to be established in the Borská field.
Later, he made a very good exchange with the master of the house in the city’s own historic center, which had a much higher value.
Then she had to join the workshop because otherwise she would threaten the construction of the land.
Households to pay interest per month
Households will have to pay from winter to summer not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and steam supplies, heat supplies and some growing and rentals.
The family will have to draw from the money from the ice to the hundreds of corals a month more than now.
Electricity costs up to 4.6 percent, electricity is about 2 percent more expensive, and in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and in many places the supply of central heating.
The electricity production should be housed in the apartments annually on the roof of the current.
As a result, the price of electricity has been reduced by all main suppliers, a significant increase in support for energy production from renewable sources, especially photovoltaic.
The wind blows slowly, even when people are the most hot and they have the highest consumption.
Each year, therefore, it must also be counted by hundreds more.
While electricity and electricity are being sold throughout the Republic, the price of central heating is changing from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned for larger villages.
For example, the house in Pardubiči or the Kingdom Hall is paid from January for central printing about 50 kroner per month, more than 1000 kroner per year is paid to the family in Liberci.
The people of Prague are also at risk that more than 9 per cent of them are exposed to water and waste, and that the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, the price will be 6.8 per cent.
However, the price in Prague will remain in the celebratory comparison between the lower.
In the north of Czech, where the prices are now between the highest, it has a water supply and a percentage of 7.4 per cent.
For example, the price increase of rent in 450 thousand rental apartments, from which the regulation ends in winter.
For example, the CPI apartment company, which in Ústá over Labem owns about 2500 apartments, is able to increase from cold rent to 100%.
Those who will not agree with the new higher rent are willing to give company to the court.
Regular rentals that pay people in about 300 thousand apartments could grow to 10 percent next year.
The Czech children drink on the telephone and the room. The beer is from fashion, it's getting a little bit less.
Fernet, rum, vodka, except for a better sign of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that end most often in the care of alcoholics who haven't been in their hands for fifteen years.
Except for children who are treated from opioids in the hospital repeatedly.
This is due to the experience of doctors who meet with similar cases in children’s clinics.
"Some beer or wine is completely bad, because it lasts a long time before you drink them."
"Trendem is certainly a strong alcohol," he told the Premier of the Children's Hospital Horóvice in the Central Czech People's Republic of Pelikán.
"If they can pull Dad's lavender out of the kitchen, it needs whiskey, otherwise it's over the fernet and the vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that they stick to the yoke and it's not so much to feel," explained the prime minister.
And for the truth, he's also given a speech by the School Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most common thing is fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially at basic schools."
"In some cases it was about a sleigh that they brought out of the house," said Jurin.
According to Pelican, there are 13 or fourteen drinks on the hospital income relatively common.
Before Horóvice, where he has been working since the year, he worked for ten years just on a pediarium in Motole, where the sanatoriums smelled glass from a wide area.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"The career started in twelve years when it was brought to us by 3.5 drops of alcohol in blood in addition to in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the Holesovic exhibition at some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all special that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," said the nurse.
Even the interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing children’s drinking.
However, according to experts in children, it is not possible to talk about independence in the right way.
"The concept of alcohol is understood by several years' chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that are due, and that is not in children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is a rather characteristic unexplained family-social background," explained the Prime Minister Pelikán.
According to spokesman Jurin's year at the paediatric clinic in Motole, 40 drunk children were hospitalized in mid - November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who have to stay in the hospital will be provided with statistics.
Children who take their parents home after ambulance treatment are never counted.
In addition to the cases where children sit alone after school and drink chicken lashes, there are three seasonal exercises in Pelican that can be dealt with: the witch, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"They either sing regret over the bad confession, or celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"I've been living on the convent for seven children's drinks together," Pelikán lamented.
The opile who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxical in the interests of combating the one who dies the other day at home with unacceptable cocaine.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are also associated with induction infusions with glucose and animals missing from the body.
"They're actually better on this, because they have a great evening experience and good entertainment and nothing is wrong."
"There are only doubts about where they are," Pelikán admitted, sometimes causing patients to suffer from a pleasant burden at least the cost of their treatment.
The transfer of the sanitizer and hospitalization to the acute bed will also take place at tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an excellent means when I counted the children's visits directly and then calculated how much they were doing and that they could spend the entire summer on the Brigade to spend on that one dinner," Pelikán added.
However, according to the Regressive Management Board, in which parental expenses for treatment do not arise in the case of child abusers.
Two L-159 flights are the first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 of the five total flights for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M transport flight, on Tuesday they flew to the Spanish Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS airport.
It's the first thing that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They were only for vacations or pre-trials in the country.
It's a double version of L-159T1, which has long been carried out by the Czech army and which has been flying.
The remaining three machines are L-159.
They are already in custody in Aero Vodochody and the trade intermediary - Omnipol - has already taken over it last week.
When the flight is physically adjusted from Vodochod, it's not according to Jan Pejška of the Press Committee that we're still known.
"One-time L-159 flights for the exchange were excluded from the long-term reserved flights, without any other investment and investment from the Ministry's resort."
"Two-way L-159T1 has been changed in the current state and manner," said the Pejšek Act.
He added that the army would not be left without bilateral flights because in May 2009, the Ministry signed an agreement with Aerem Vodochody on a value of 200 million kroner for the transfer of four L-159 non-required machinery to two bilateral machinery.
One new flight took over the army in July, the other we'll move to the end of the year.
According to Pejška, the EADS committed that the planes are moving into the army of some alien countries.
"It is clearly stated in the contract that the air carrier L-159 is an EADS company and will serve as a pilot trainer from NATO. "
"That's why it's the picker how this thing will be realized," Pejšek said.
In the past, economic newspapers have stated that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159 is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one flight of Casa and the purchase of three other flights for 3.5 billion kroner has been approved by the government of Mirka Topolánka.
The Ministry of Defence did not refer to the purchase of electoral controls and expressed directly to EADS.
The current defence led to the argument that the amendment supported future exports of L-159 to the foreign country.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest she wanted to sell.
The purchase of Casa's plane will probably have a court hearing.
The European Commission, however, complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice that the aircraft should be selected on the basis of a European trend and never a single producer.
The army has already taken over three Cassa flights, the last of which would have to fly to Kbely's Prague airport within fourteen days.
A higher indicator than a finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an indicator greater than a fingernail are exposed to a lower risk of cancer.
This is an amazing conclusion to the study published in the middle of the British cancer magazine.
It can be related to the fat of male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of cancer of prostitution, especially for men up to 60 years," said co-author of the study of Ros Eeles, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus be used to determine which men should submit the cancer test, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other hazardous factors such as family health care, added Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she was closely monitored with colleagues in Britain over 1500 patients with cancer and more than three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the students had a sign on their right hand than a ring.
It paid for them the same probability of cancer of prostitutes as 19 percent of those whose fingers were equally long.
In the case of those who had an indicator greater than a fingernail, however, the risk was 33 per cent, even 87 per cent lower for men to sixty-six.
The ratio of the length of two mentioned fingers - created in the prenatal period - is clearly reflecting the different levels of sex hormones in which the child is exposed in the piece.
Less testosterone corresponds to a further indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone directly supports the growing cancer of prostitutes.
The former Czech genetics and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that he knew about this study, but he does not think that the relationship between long fingers and cancer was "fully demonstrated".
Czechs are under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the railways and on the roads, most of the snowy snows, the railways in many places drove all night.
In the morning, D5 is closed between 89 and 93 kilometres in the direction of Rozwad because of a number of lack of expensive and personal cars and is also D1 in Brna in the direction of Prague.
The newspaper said this to the Central Automobile Dictionary (UAMK).
On the 91th mile [91 km], a truck, 93 miles [93 km], two expensive cars broke down, and an accident called for damage.
A number of personal cars have also ended in the attack.
The problems are also at D1 distance to 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks broke in there.
Drivers should eat a hundred miles behind Brne at 190 km or go across Brno and then drive 182 km to Kyvalce.
There are several kilometres of columns.
There's also an accident on the D11, and it's coming to Prague right now.
In Prague there are several centimetre snow species, the temperature indicates less than seven degrees Celsius.
Cars, for example, are built on Prosek, which is also built in Štérboholska.
The safest means of transport is a meter.
Tramvay runs late, for example, on the route between Karl's place and the town of Mera.
In the morning, he's going to sit back in the Persian crisis scene again.
There are also railway and airport problems.
The Czech dragons had already had to break down seven fast connections because of snow.
The problem is, for example, going from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The Russian airport was closed from 11 o'clock in the middle of the night to 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most of the road to South Moravia is already slow, but only increased caution.
In Switzerland, there are three remote railways, in Brñńsk there are places where snow language is created, and in Blanchesku there are a need for some communication in the above-mentioned snow ranges.
To the most reached, the island belonged to Hiškovko.
There are currently closed roads: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milesovie.
They're gonna have to put the brakes on.
When they're released, they can't figure it out yet.
There is a need for caution in the region of the White Carpaths.
On roads where the protection of nature is maintained only by inert susceptibility, the ČTK indicated that it is still up to 50 centimetres of snow type.
In Czech, it fell from two to ten inches [2 to 10 cm] of snow, most of which fell in northern Czechs, sometimes up to 18 inches [18 cm].
About 15 inches [15 cm] of snow fell in the country of Moravskosleslez.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually rising.
American soldiers have a new smart weapon.
The U.S. Army has set up a new "discreet" weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the code mark XM-25.
Generals hope that the new automatic gun will affect the dark conflict with Taliban and "change the game" in their advantage.
The new weapon is something like a little super-transparent piece.
Her designs are still known as lasers with precision for several meters.
Special needles of 25 mm, produced for this rifle and containing high explosive content, actually work as small granite.
Fears can be programmed in such a way that they explode not only in the face of the goal but at any point in their ballistic dramas.
It can then be used against enemies who hide behind a barrier, behind a wall, or in a shelter.
Shore is not usually protected, and when a deadly cloud of steel bursts pours on it, it can be controlled by war.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new weapon is the first weapon for the bridge, which uses "discreet" technology.
"A soldier with her is basically going to find a target to go to him with a laser paper, which determines the distance, so he will get a clear objective point, according to him, correct the design and strengthen the angle."
"Let's say you've planned 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun will go down and fire the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be transferred
The Fujitsu Group is moving its side from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July of the next year from the available administrative building at the Marienbader-Nämmermälst at Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As in the middle, the giant in the field specialized in computers and their maintenance will be transferred to the next year in July 400 men and women from their office building in Marienbader-Nämmer, Bad Homburg, to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in the Lyons Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the speaker Fujist, there should be another 100 other jobs in the group, which are currently divided into the region, at the appropriate time.
The offer to rent was too attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park to attract employees.
Fujitsu was also in Bad Homburg only in the rent.
Commissioner Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection with the airport is just as important for the global company as Fujitsu.
The recent movement of an important undertaking within the region brought joy to the winners and to the cuts in the wounded yesterday.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said it was possible to achieve a "global player".
It's just "a fantastic manifestation of trust in this place."
Fujitsu is heading to the city, breakfast is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Old Bad Homburg, Michael Korvisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was first informed by the management of its purpose.
"Of course we've offered our help," said Korvis.
Friendly contacts, however, did not change the difficulty of computer manufacturers with the owner of the property at Marienbader.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now one thing is to avoid a long absence at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and the owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house at the Rathaus University, which was recently used by Fujitsu, and the nearby "Cleane Verticale" belonged with the other buildings in Marienbader-Nativity to the most discussed construction plans in the city of Lasenj.
Between the metro and the workshop came to be a joint city project and a private projector such as the city entrance, which was criticised for the massive establishment of the area which previously served as a park and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company of investment advice and rating Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved to the home as did the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens company.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Cancen-Group and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and were sold in Madrid by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA.
Fujitsu group from Tokyo is identified as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, a computer company and services available and is also concerned about the necessary service.
The district in the region of Rīna and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but most of the Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
Bad Homburg is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad daughter company Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other female companies in this area will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
In the administrative building, Astro Park was located for this purpose 7,000 square meters.
In the complex - its name warns of a planetary landscape, which is twenty years old, sitting in addition to the average flow of the electronic and electronic industry.
Amazon Cancels the server - Hits against Assangem
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
The Amazon Internet Service launched a platform for detection on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of the statistics of secret diplomatic records.
Founder Wikileaks Assange is apparently held in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, the detection platform, is getting in the United States under increasing pressure.
Internet activists have lost access to their home server in America and are now searching for Internet homes in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and businesses to fight Wikileaks.
And the Founder Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is on the list of Interpols, is to be held in accordance with a press contribution to the United Kingdom.
"The Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free display in the free country," they announced active release of short Twitter messages in the middle (local time).
A short time ago, the Amazon company became Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage a high number of access to documents.
With the help of Twitter, Wikileaks explained this step: "Fin - our dollars are now lost by working people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, they should stop selling books.
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after the former senator Joe Lieberman's patrols were released by CNN television station on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The President of the Senate Committee on Domestic Defence threatened the Amazon Boycott, informing British Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to join this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for a ban on the use of servers in other countries.
"Wickleaks is one illegal, harmless and undisclosed and therefore our national security is exposed to danger and threatens life on earth," said a non-participating senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
Founder Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list of Interpol found.
On the basis of reports in the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian is held in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internet activists have always marked an investigation in Sweden for the interests of their opponents.
Speaking of Wikileaks Kristin Hraffsson in London, he said there was even an outbreak.
"Even though there were calls for Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange's right is afraid of his safety, Hraffsson said.
That's why Wikileaks will keep hiding.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the North American productions.
In the United States, former Republican Governor Arkansasu, Mike Huckabee, requested that the person responsible for the release of Wikileaks for fraud be charged and corrected.
In Canada, a leader of the government, Stephen Harper, said on television - well ironic, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target flight".
Between the White House and Assange's vocabulary shot.
American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "a funny and absurd" that Assange asked for a foreign minister's representation of Hillary Clinton if he is responsible for recent published Spanish diplomats' challenges.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of a person with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its websites."
The U.S. government is now investigating the security of its databases.
The Special Commissioner was appointed Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorist Action Centre, Russell Travers, to distribute the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "needed reforms in the structure", which are necessary after the release of the message from the release to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would like to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to get into danger due to the release of Wikileaks.
"We've given up everything to get in touch with them," said the Foreign Minister Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them, though it would be necessary."
Winter University
At the Galato University in Bolon are preparing frozen sugars for a better annual period.
On the basic course for future winterers, which lasts for three days, is great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream actually?
Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, a Czech skirmisher, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian winter art.
Gelataio sells a frozen ice cream from the cold box, puts it in the shower and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about the ice, the Italian company Carpigiani will not be excluded from the Galato-University.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines of the ice Universities set up to meet the high Italian ideals.
On the basic course for the future Gelatier, which lasts for three days, is huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But it also offers several daily special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in its own ice cream.
Someone complains in their Midlife-Crisis after a new career, others are taken to the heavy ice of their inexplicable complaints.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream industrial country in the future.
Even in Berlin, she is a business consultant and would like to start her own business after years of hard work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a ice-cream in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's home, because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal properties of perfect winter.
The solution is not only good taste, but also noble jealousy and good consistency.
Luciano doesn't forget during his school in the south and the owner's kitchen: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there's still a need for a romantic dose."
The first step of the product seems to be simple at all.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, butter, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mix, which covers all of the electronic program at 85 degrees and then accommodates at four levels immediately.
Then he turns around on the kitchen machine and runs pasteurized white basic cream, based on all kinds of milk creams.
Immediately the teacher is asked questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to let himself be destroyed by a spirit of ignorance.
Who speaks of ice "only from natural plants", apparently using stabilisers - most natural products, such as guarantor molluscs.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will fall and the customer will own the ice cream.
Certain variations of basic weights are permitted.
It's going to be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano dissolves in hot colds according to the rules that are bought in the supermarket either in fruit or in sugar.
In addition, there are rice and creams.
"The contributors will try to introduce a lot of aromatized vows."
"But you should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or frozen from a white background weight that changes the eggs on a yellow cream and cheese on the basis of a different chocolate test.
Now it's possible to take a course in ice cream machines.
Luciano is always allowed to produce four different types of vanilica, chocolate, coffee and lysopharyngeal ice - whether or not with eggs or without them in a basic quantity, with more or less vanilic flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is being carried out with fruity kinds of ice cream.
The more aromatic substances, the more fruity pyre - given the taste, it's not always better.
Liscooric salt must not taste any more oysters if it contains more oysters.
The most popular ice cream made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Even when the mixture is exported, Gelato's taste is rightly aroused, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is purely the starting task: If broccoli pepper is used with a lot of sugar, the share of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
In the citron salt, extra sugar is needed.
Luciano produces a device that determines the content of the sugar in the fruit (in this way it measures the taste of the grapes).
Tables of luck ease the numbers.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much as it used to be.
It does not only help the automatic production of basic weights.
There is also a device that allows the preparation of the frozen mixture to cool into the cream at the same time and cools at a low temperature.
And despite all the automation, we don't get rid of small accidents.
Brasilan Gustavo keeps himself and his colleagues out of the shade to the bottom of a fruit pyre when he gets out of control of the giant mix.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time when something like this happens."
Two-light auditors
The European Food Authority for Efsa is engaged in an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge has now been expressed by a group of Testbiotes experts, which is considered to be an independent institution for the analysis of the results of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a spicle theory, but we've documented it well," said in the middle of Munich's Chief Testbiote Christoph Then.
The leading team of Efsa experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts have been engaged in a contract with their Ilsi pilots for several years.
He's a funded group like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Cooper shared the decisive way in which the Efsa control rules for genetic plants are applied and are so clearly on the way to interest, then criticises.
The rules of the Efsa are in accordance with the whole of Ilsi documents and are not such a manuscript of the industry that should be controlled by the Italian Parliament.
It's already a matter of what Testbiots are warning against the pursuit of interests.
A senior manager from Ephesus recently passed without supplements or transitional periods to the Swiss Agricultural Group of Syngenta - and thus changed the parties.
A press release for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently removed the EU's personal contact with the industrial lobby control agency, which has raised the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and the EU's Members.
In the meantime, Efsa can't recognize the interest rate.
It is working with all the serial data, so also with the industry, if they are highly skilled, is indicated in one statement.
Experts working for Ephesus are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But he's got to fix it.
Cooper recognises his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only identified as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - except for the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts like Then criticise that at the present time, genetically modified plants are currently allowed to grow in animals without any animal testing, and that there is no test of the response of genetic plants to the effects of the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, will make genetically modified corn on the ground," says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins rather than the whole genetic plant, which does not have reliable results.
"If they don't look for the risk, how could they be found then?" he asks, regretfully, then.
With that, Angelika Hilbeck agreed.
Scientific staff have studied engineering since 1994 and are currently working at the Technical High School in Curych.
In this area, industry is being tried as in the United States, and now in Europe it is increasingly affecting or discrediting critical scientists.
That's why there's almost no scientists who wouldn't agree with the group.
Most of them do not publish studies that are critical to society.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck thinks.
Stone level
Uli Gsell also organized some 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he was standing in front of a train in Stuttgart, a tunnel on the back.
She was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The experience is: In September the bars came and began to shake a large corner of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands have demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar decline in the climate.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were in the chests.
Breaked to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A warrior from Crailsheum, a soft rough stone used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sugar in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these shirts.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't lose."
It says, "Live and poor stone, simple and protruding."
When one broke, he died after a cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those shirts.
Stones have time.
He's got Gsell too.
The foot of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest in Tübingen at the former warehouse of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone.
A 44-year-old man is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who came up during the strike in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were looking at a girl or lost to a deposition," says her office, a wooden house that was previously a housekeeper.
He says that he was threatened and threatened when in a session of all the newspapers, he bought the rest of the northern wing from the demonist society.
But he talked to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that the demons can't do it at all.
And when that's happening, it's the most sensible thing when rocks are still being used.
Then there were about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, price of between €6.50 and €14.
As a reminder, some also hope to bring him back to life at the rebuilt building.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cost 25 big expensive cars.
Maybe half of it's still in the woods, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Gardeners, national gardeners, housekeepers.
They came out of all the boxes and took what came into the suitcase and to the front.
The stones of the fighting from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "darks" or as the roots of the quarrels with the rebels.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political engagement."
He sits in his field car and goes on a journey after his 20th hectar kingdom.
He studied in front of the law, the studio broke down, later biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a lover of stones.
He's got 40,000 tons of stones.
He's taking care of his assets from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest businessman with old stones in the Republic.
It's crazy.
In the snow there is an artist-made song.
"One time they belonged to the Marien bridge in the Drajdjanes," she says.
Labe, yellow, warm, it's superfluous.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on our way up the woods.
It points to a group: a red sandbag, early part of the farm in Karlsruhe.
Now.
"A nice travertine."
Once those squares were on the Neckarstadion court in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidential office in Stuttgart, red granite from Sankt Blasien temple, a hospital tube in Heilbron.
What a job, what a trap, what a path.
When Rongen thinks of how stones were cut manually and carried with the help of simple washing machines and running vehicles, he will become quite active.
"It would be a scandal if something like that happened."
He's not rich, he's not very rich at all.
The stone merchant works today but employs 14 people, and in addition, they have planted a stone in the forest, one sugar, one cup, one glass and one garden.
"We work hard, but it's comforting," says the one who assesses the rest.
He has to go to Colina in due time.
There'll be rocks there too.
High potential talent talent battle
There's a lot of people in the neighborhood.
16 students are pressed into bread with lasos, lunches and sweetness.
The technical university in Braunschweig and car manufacturers Volkswagen invited students to the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW companies here, they should talk about the car of the future - and that's just how to meet Volkswagen.
A lot of companies are trying to run the smartest head, just like VW, to succeed and sit in cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: What is the first possible recruitment of the most profitable graduates in the audience, even before they get to the labour market and take care of others.
Since universities do not provide any list of students’ success, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practical projects and to acquire them.
At TU Braunschweig the car company is trying to get talents the next day.
One young lady from the private department distributes props, rubber rings and boards with VW logo.
He tells reliable young talent about practical programs, student jobs, and gives them a route to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is looking at the project together with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, students can get to know each other, get to know the interesting candidates and think about who would become a co-workers."
Such cooperation, according to Sele, is not unusual.
But the news is that it's so open about students.
" otherwise, it was a most important professional project," says Sele.
The fight for pure graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees from long-term deposits.
On the other hand, he must try and try to find, in particular, high-qualified labour force.
In particular, the graduates of the engineering teams have excellent coordination positions.
According to the data from Svazu of German engineers, VDI remained in October with 40,000 uncontained positions.
And according to VDI's forecast, there's still a shortage of engineers.
For the auditory and advisory company KPMG, Roman Dykt goes to the talent hunt.
It organises a convenient Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern stock race where participants need to find a route according to the GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send these eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can at the same time look at the KPMG branches and meet with the company.
First, it shall be decided on two selections who will participate.
Only Créme de la Créme from many interested people fly to the United States.
In the High Potentials file at the universities they will pay according to the Dikty still stricter laws.
"We want to separate ourselves from the rest of our race."
"The simple trip to the beach was very small for us."
Looks like the bounty hunter is lucky.
"We've been in contact with all the participants like this in the past year."
"Some will soon finish the study and plan to get to work with us," she says.
In addition to the direct speech on the campus, small and medium-sized companies present classics on the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the professional exhibitions."
"For example on Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of the solar technology manufacturer's staff department Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
In fact, he knows the problem with young workers.
Currently there are 35 posts on the company's website.
"At the present time, it is quite difficult to have free space."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another possibility is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors inform us that we can practice or write diplomatic work."
Solar specialist does not arrange any expensive advertising actions.
Instead, the company is trying to cope with other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Great groups can't offer it often," says the head of the staff department.
When looking for a job, money doesn't play a major role for a long time.
Flexible working time, child care or good practice options are other factors that are crucial.
Solarworld had a study of the Great Place to Work 55. place among 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute is the annual list of best German employees.
In addition, employees are asked how they are satisfied with their work and work environment and follow the framework conditions of employees.
The Director of the Staff's Personal Division hopes that her placement will bring points to the employees.
"I believe that stakeholders are particularly informed about the external evaluations of potential employee," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy offers companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good news as an employee.
He's recommending his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means, in particular, internal measures.
"The best way to visit as an attractive employee leads through your own employee," she says.
In particular, this is called the Internal Employment Branding, so the entry of employees into the market in the context of their own employees.
"The peace of the employees is the best delivery."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make themselves advertising to their employees between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with a ride," says Kriegler.
Obama's gonna stop the new robins.
During the next few years, they did not emerge before the border of the state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued the corresponding order - and thus canceled the previous plans with the finality.
New varieties are still under ban in front of the Atlantic coast.
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar delivered it in the middle.
The reason for the strict order that should be paid for at least the following five years is the explosion on the deepwater Horizon in depth.
Before this tragedy, which continued to have eleven employees leading to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled an attack on the opposition and industry of his will, allowing new gardens in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The rest of the population is trying to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is not explained in detail who is responsible for the destruction of the oil crop in the lake.
In the middle of the crisis, the British energy group BP is confronted with billions of demands.
The investigation commission entrusted to Obama should submit the results during the December.
In October, Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar refused the award order that he paid from the explosion.
As a result, various robust groups of applications were submitted for new gardening purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster from more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
At the present time, the control authority is basically reformed, which has warned many of the corrupt charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would reduce the lucrative opportunities of taxable customers for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of heavy oil in the lake.
"The government plans are the biggest rush for the growth of the oil and oil industry," says the results of the current study in the area of the BDO Advisory Company - even before the mid-term ban.
The American Energy Alliance still complains about the uncertainty in the area: "No one knows exactly what changes are going to happen."
Investments in new construction projects are being made up to call for growth.
The area of the Ogoni shrill
The water in the rivers is oily, sandy like pumps: billions of litres of unique roses have destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption, and illegal smoking of clothes.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't touch yourself," the environmental activists comfort: "Today you'll get a lot of rough grass in front of the project."
The 37-year-old Nigerian was following the attempt to photograph the boy who sails through the water that surrounds the snow: this scene moves into the water pool with spiritual colors almost as beautiful as the beauty.
The fact that under the blue surface of a rock-crazed rock, it's not visible.
Previously, she had gathered enough grain here, sent Esther Bado on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flood of water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large number of roses came to the vast area of the district.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must spend at least six hours to get to the water where the fish are: the area of Ogoni, located in the heart of the river Niger, belongs to one of the world’s greatest frozen areas.
The route along the river by mangrove pools with a lot of side effects is very well known throughout the village.
The engine on the floor is burning instead of light water with hot gas, and whoever puts his hand into the water will pull out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves depend on the land as a black branch of medicine, the leaves that grow from palm trees leave their leaves unsatisfied.
We're looking for beautiful birds, which are usually produced in wet areas: As soon as the engine stops on the floor, it grows in an early paradise, where it smells like pumps, scary silence.
"What's playing here is the ecological leadership of the war," laments Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with war is justified.
The area of the settlement of Ogoni is a vital field where it has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first inhabitants of Europe were assembled here, here in the 1980s, created the first battle with later reformed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was very dangerous for employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while it is daily difficult from the area of the three-size district of Switzerland with more than 5,000 welds and 7000 kilometres of driving more than two million barrels of black gold, lies a rough field in the Ogoni village area, for the group this situation is very unstable.
Each several hundred meters relate to the water of the steel structure as a strange soybean: "The Night Trees", so much is called the heads of the gardens.
They're 50 years old, most of them to the sea.
Every minute, the head of such a garden opens, Akpobari reports, and then the constant flow of roses into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres per 50 years went into the ecosystem: Each year, the amount of roses that emerged into the sea in Alaska at the disaster of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest disasters in the history of mankind.
They're arguing who's still responsible for the ongoing ecological accident.
While the Shell Group marks the sabbatical and organised robin theft of more than 90 per cent of the pollution, it speaks of the protection of the environment over the cracking heads of the gardens and the unhindered guides as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires much less security regulations than it is in the world, said a group in 2008 U.S. scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of accidents on the ledges is only "a few times higher than others".
In a place that looks like abandoned, oil-contained area under the wide sky, it comes out of mangroves: they are completely wet and after the roof of the oil.
Under one of the many courts, which are partly connected with leadership, partly deliberately dispersed across the country, fires the fire: illegal small raffinery.
Ropa's been burning in the fire court for several hours, explains Michael, the leading group.
Before running from driving into the exhaust tank, later cap at the end of driving kerosin and finally oil.
In this way Michael and his four colleagues make up up to four judges every day, 300 litres: "We'll do that 34,000 Naira" - around $22.
The inhabitants of the districts use the chronic shortage of gravitational moisture in the largest black African country.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A mixed low price of 40 cents per litre of oil may still be passed by illegal producers: because they have raw materials free of charge.
It comes from "bunkers", who are involved in taking the lead everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, the entire area of the Niger River loses at least 16 million litres of oil per day.
But only a very small portion of provisionally stored raw materials will be illegal: most of the fully organised criminal network, to which also belongs the policies and high positions of military representatives, to tankers and they sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether caused by the disaster of the citizens and their practices or the slow way of production, considers Akpobari activists to be a clean academic.
"If we didn't consider ourselves thieves and if we didn't completely destroy the life of fishermen, there would be neither sabotage nor thefts and illegal raffinery."
In the meantime, however, the relationship with Ogoni is especially so devastated to Shell that it only appears to the group's departure: "Maybe other nations as China as better as possible will be shown."
Michael's upset.
"The tallest time for you to fail," says the delicious producer.
"The soldiers can come at any time."
If they find a special military unit, they're not at risk of prison, but a painful charge.
Also, soldiers who come from the north of the country - like all the Nigerians - want to benefit from the raw materials.
"That damn thing got our land all the way down," says Akpobari.
Inspectors have found a dangerous construction error in engines A380
A380 obviously has a big security undertaking.
The investigators found a possible construction error that could lead to a "disaster engine crash".
Kantas Airport wants to appeal to motor manufacturers.
Kantas' airbus was probably more fortunate at the start of November than it was already known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has found a great safety undertaking on some A380 engines - and now warns against possible failure.
The undertaking may have serious consequences: a single oil connection could lead to disputes because of the need, this Thursday was set up in a public statement by the ATSB Authority.
This reality could lead to a disaster of the engine.
It's about the engines produced by Rolls-Royce in the 20th series of A380.
Among them is Kantas' airbus, which had to arrive in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against British turbine producers.
He reasoned the appeal before the Australian Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows other legal measures against this company.
The head of Kantas Alan Joyce said his company would demand compensation for an incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and they damaged their noses.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of damage to fuel oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be switched around the world.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests with a range of aeroplanes equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, ATSB Martin Dolan said.
The lack of safety has been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency operation, Kantas left his flying company A380 on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its units A380 overland.
Lufthansa has replaced one A380 engine as a security measure.
The two-way plane is the world's largest personal plane.
National snowing causes chaos in the right
Germany's entire white: almost snowed all over the country through the night.
On many roads, government chaos, train connections and aircraft have been destroyed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter is cold in Germany: almost the entire Republic falls on Thursday at winter temperatures - leading to many places to transport chaos.
It lies in some places up to 15 inches [15 cm] north and east.
On a few distances and many roads, there is a very limited transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the railway service was still in place, but it did not manage new snows.
There was still a strong wave wind over the Baltic Sea.
The BSH is expected on the Baltic Sea coast in Switzerland-Holstínsk on the afternoon of the storm with a water of 1.2 metres above normal.
The snow cover has caused significant problems in Saska to the distance and state roads.
According to the centre of the bad weather Meteomedia was therefore the highest level of fear in Switzerland - at the highest level.
In part, a 30 - inch - long [30 cm] new snow, strong and clean winds caused floods.
There were several expensive and personal vehicles left at night.
The police have also reported serious road problems in the Sasku-Anhaltsk area.
On A2, he caused the wind and snow to slow down the operation and the joints.
In Durinska there were problems with snow at A4 and A9.
According to the German drama, there is a great deal of difficulty in Saska, Sasku-Anhaltsk, Durinska and in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the wheels, turned trees on the wheels or broken up on the top and out.
In Saska, the long journey from Lipska to Norimberg has to be stopped.
In the door-to-door Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Mnicho.
165 passengers got in the train from passengers and rescuers loaded with blankets, food and drink.
Snow wind over the road.
The great German airports were destroyed for many years because of the snow winds.
According to the information centres for the years has already been reported from Minichov for years.
In Frankfurt to Mohan, it was broken down by Fraport for 40 years.
The maintenance of the engine is in constant contact.
There were only a few passengers on the airport, but 400 full beds were prepared for them.
There's been a lot of road accidents in the middle of the night.
One driver died last night while fighting a train on a train in eastern Holland.
The driver was easily injured.
Because of the enchanted train, near Norimberg, a similar accident occurred: a cost car was also caught on the railway drive because the vehicle was driven.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the trail from Bayreuth to Norimberg, which is why they stayed until the morning hours were closed.
And a 30-year-old woman died after she returned to Aschaffenburg on a train.
Meteorologists, however, have a good message: snow will remain in the form of light rain, and therefore it will rise in the light of the wind.
But the wind's getting cold.
Only at the Baltic Sea will be the fast winds of the wind.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twins
Deutsche Bank wants to be released with its mark: According to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two chains with the offices in the headquarters of Frankfurt.
Improperty could cost up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank just renovate its seat of the group: two-folds in the Frankfurt banking district were modernized; in the meantime the bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now, obviously, the financial group wants to renovate again - and is looking for buyers for both darks, as it informs "Financial Times Deutschland" with a call to speak.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still testing whether it's more meaningful property to own or sell and then find again," he said.
This means that the largest credit institution in Germany will return to its company’s office after a short time.
The Bank took a fresh-double loan for EUR 272 million from its own fund investors in mid-2007 and then refurbished it accordingly.
Energy generation, according to data, is around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
The experts in the field estimate the value of the new text among the thresholds named "Greentovers" at a price of about EUR 500 million.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the owner of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of trolls for dead hills
More than 10,000 people have won the memory of sleepy peaks in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions below.
Still unable to release the dead because the security situation continues to be complex in the chess.
Nearly two weeks ago, it came to the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth to a powerful explosion.
29 mountaintops between 17 and 62 years of age were infected.
To the corner where the accident occurred, the probe was dropped, but there was no way out of life.
Due to high concentrations of evaporative fluids and subsequent explosions, safety forces could not be found.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came up with no chance of survival.
He still couldn't release the dead.
Now they've lost the memory of dead friends and friends.
Ten thousand people were gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand during the sun's time.
It's been two minutes.
The memory of the sleeping hills was set up 29 tables, helmets, lights and names of the mountaintops.
Also pictures and personal things, such as clothing and surfing rings, found their place here.
In the state government buildings trained half a yard.
New Zealand hoped that the tops would come back from the "deep ground" on the ground, the Prime Minister of New Zealand's John Key told the participants about the memorial action.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead, said Laurie Drew, whose son Zen was shot down.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victim, several foreign diplomats were also involved.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African rebels were also attacked.
The rescuers started by burning fire inside a wooden bottom on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the current currents are released, it begins with the release of high temperature inside the floor, said police president Gary Knowles.
To hell, warriors!
What's going on in the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refung is trying to get back to the old border with his war era "Wallalla Rising".
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think when he said "Wallalla Rising"?
The busy Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from their torturers and in a large killing almost with the overcrowded strength of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young French monsters who are looking for blood action because our garden helps its cruel methods of killing and its enemies even the insides of the belly when it has bad cold.
On the other hand, the One, as is actually called, will not say a word during the entire film and the rest of the articles will bring at least one or two candles or will be allowed to stare at the passionful death cry.
On the other hand, they are quiet and play in a very beautiful, hilly territory of Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is an ideal sleep for an adult cinema with an interest in existentialism and a very quiet collection of cameras.
It's good to have a film of more target groups, it's just damage when they're apart from each other.
Director Winding Refn, following his wild and stylized trilogy of drug dealers "Pusher", is considered as a Danish version of Director Quentina Tarantina, but the stocks are protected so that their work is closer to the humorous main performance or less brutal to the artistic public.
Most of the artists of the cinema are obviously allowed to work everywhere with the ringing brains and the interiors.
Activist filmmakers are no later than at a time when the United Nations is released for free explanation with a group of violent Christian missionaries on board Jerusalem and will continue to live forever in the air and the tongue, before it is apparent that the man in America is still silent.
It's not surprising, then, that Wallalla Rising didn't get into the kitchen in Germany and now he was only released on DVD.
It is particularly damaging to beautiful sights, but also because it is a personal façade, places to shed blood, conceals an exciting movie that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or exact action, it's all an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for the wonder of escape.
The refn does not support him at the moment of release and slowly breathes him into his nightmares and his hypnotic soundtrack, especially the unrecorded hate that breaks out of the heart's condition.
Just a little blond boy who helps the One, leaves something like innocence, all the others are motivated by evil.
Of all the one host whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and a transition from war to war from hell, perhaps the Devil’s envoy.
It's making a bond, maybe, but it's just for those who've got it.
"Wallalla Rising" is an interesting movie that is possible to hate and admire, for breaking up, exaggerating and impressing.
Let's go.
Landing work
The IAEA's nuclear power agency has a new warning on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country defends the declaration - and even does not allow controls.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 I attacked a four-storey building in Syria.
They are located on the coast of Euphorat; the nearest city is 30 kilometers away and the name is Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reveal its name when one of the reactors that has been set up by Syria with the help of North Korea in this quarter is located in the valley that is off-road.
On the basis of a communication from the US-American foreign secret CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village El-Kibar, would have been well prepared for the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
It's not gonna happen to a technique in the '50s.
The CIA presented videos with undiscovered satellite photos.
Using computer animation, explain where the reactor components could be before the destruction, it should be discussed as a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, photographs were presented that showed the building close or even outside.
The reactor was just before the launch, but without fuel items.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it doesn't know much more than this time, even more than a few more times.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently announced in his memory that the CIA was very sure that Syria was in El-Kibar reactor before the attack, but in principle it had no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some reporting services in Europe are even more careful and are only talking about a "data reactor", even though the CIA's presentations consider it to be "reliable".
They lack clear evidence, just like IAEA.
When asked how he's sure he's got a reactor in front of him, he answered a senior UN diplomat in summer, IAEA has before "a lot of material to solve questions".
The apparently "unusable military buildings" were quickly detached by the Syrians and also accurately adjusted the land.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team was under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar, who was made human.
In addition, IAEA received a satellite photograph of commercial sellers from the time following an attack that should be higher than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these restrictions are not on the market because he bought exclusively an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
That's why IEA can't confirm their rights.
Syria has always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear programme and has not set up a reactor.
The Uranus comes from Israel's weapons. Damascus appears.
But that's what returned the IAEA after the partial analysis.
From that time on, Damasjek refuses to discuss the matter - as well as the satellites.
In addition, he ordered another inspection by auditors in El-Kibar and access to several bombed buildings.
But Israel is also mild - tempered.
"We will never comment on this," a recent official opinion was confirmed by the then ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case will take place immediately from June 2008 and "has become a serious problem in view of the Authority's reliability", as admitted by the High Western Diplomat at the IAEA in Vienna - one of the major violations of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons that the IAEA is observing.
The IAEA considers it to be the key to progress in the matter of three other devices that should be "in functional connection" with the given reactor - and that there is still a difference.
However, the auditors did not provide any information on any device, nor on any function, nor on why they were suspected.
According to the news, Süddeutsche Zeitung is an IAEA internal marked as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah, driven again by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on satellite video sets, which is probably one of the suspects.
Apparently within or without the immediate proximity of the military base - for that reason Syria refuses to access the IAEA to these three places.
In Vienna it was reported that Syria was afraid of such fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent to the United States to back up the military base.
The nuclear detectives were warned on the U.S. secret service device.
The IAEA also has satellite photos that the materials were transported here and there between these three places and the quarter in Euphorat.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one device should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is no "no evidence of sensible activities" and therefore of urination and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is affected by the urine that is not contaminated.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium should be released later on the bomb, there are only likely answers to these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the pores that could hide the important steps are stored in these three places.
The Jacobs disappeared from the surface of the land cost of expensive vehicles, and no one seems to have any information from where that court arrived.
Only a few kilometres from El-Kibar away and on the other side of Euhratu lies the solar duty of al-Tibni, which was allowed by Syria to check in 1998 as an appropriate fund for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelly gave him contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Photos from the universe, however, show that, after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspected land jobs and removed large containers.
It could have been an accident, but it didn't explain the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles are talking about the fact that IAEA has spent many months developing a review plan that would allow Syria to maintain any military secret - only this tool shows how much interest the auditors have.
Damašek, among other things, rejected this proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vidni had calmed down that the reactor has been destroyed, and that's why it's not worse, a few months ago, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about such special inspections, which is one of the strongest means that the visual nuclear control agency has.
Chief of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken about "the possibilities I'm looking forward to in the future," but it's still difficult.
This choice poses a great risk: on the one hand, the need for a majority of the IAEA government council and many of the 35 countries represented are not particularly interested in climbing.
On the other hand, how does one diplomat warn, "What happens when they find nothing at all?"
Love in Wartime
Since the time Angelina Jolie started working on an empty regime in summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote her own scenario about a kind story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
He doesn't know much about it yet, but he doesn't.
She was constantly talking about the fact that during the war in Yugoslavia, this Muslim woman fell in love with the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bosnian Women's Associations immediately protested, so soon plans were moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film was interconnected in Hungary and was in post-production, but still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote through the UN-Organization with the help of UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the heretic, informing now the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also a very popular UN-Organization with the help of refugees.
It's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a week ago in Hungary, which they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where violence was perpetrated, the loving stories were not perfect, and Jolie's position against the victim reveals enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN organisation to help the hostages miss Jolie as an alien, to inform Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has been able to read her scenario, has allowed for smaller halls in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie has not come.
The young author points out that in his film there is no political idea that she has committed a great deal of conflict in Yugoslavia to show the terrible consequences of war and to give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains unchanged.
There is another version of the film on the Internet, which sounds quite different: lovers knew each other before the start of the war, and they meet again when she is as a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp where she serves as a soldier.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape is in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - it's true.
Jolie claims that there's a pressure on her, which "is not fair and is based on false information."
Now she can be released from Hollywood by hackers: The fact that she's publicly illegally on the Internet is how many times she's done it.
Nothing to Skip
This evening it's good for Iry once again.
Don't go after the funeral.
The domestic team dominates very well over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans are happy to hear the voice of music, the dumb feet.
Baley-Pub in the South Cork War, because players are throwing tennis balls at three meters into the pools - and they're tired.
"Pinný pong" is called a unique feast and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and for this flight to Las Vegas at the world's mysteries in the pier pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and sustainable information, it doesn't work very well together.
Still, a 26-year-old man is trying to get involved, to answer such a question, which brings about the future.
His plan is not to play in Las Vegas, he's going to talk to New Zealand in January.
"I have such a weird feeling," she says.
"It's so far away and I still don't have a job there."
Still: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She soon got her excellent job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of the bad look of the house, two of the three Tanner neighbors have tried to make their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
Boys leave: Like Tanners, it looks like it's in many families on the island.
100 000 Ireland will leave in the country at the time it is due, the experts of the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They count up to 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
For a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the forecast is confirmed, it will come to a similar exploratory wave, such as that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After ten years of the rise that brought great prosperity to Iran, the disillusionment is now widening again.
The economic crisis destroys, in particular, the young, educated Irish, who have just lived up to it.
The loss of employment and social cohesion has been absurd in these years.
Everyone needs it. The money was too much.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men have been unemployed for up to thirty years.
In Irish Times there are many letters of readers who complain, "In Ireland everything comes from the head."
"You should come up against politicians and bankers - who can, that goes away and our country loses the entire generation."
"The last one, please shut up."
The student of law Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government offers no prospects for the future for young people only.
"They reduce minimum income, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," 20 years old says.
She notices how her colleagues move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move herself in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressive."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organises a "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition that offers a full service on foreign work.
"For starters on the labour market, work abroad is quite an excellent opportunity to do the first steps on the career grid," says the manager.
On its website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboards in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not difficult, but freedom and joy.
He knows what it's like to build something somewhere else, he's been in Seán O'Donovan for six months.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish construction colleagues in Germany.
It's right in Gelsenkirchen's fashion house.
He goes on to Hannover or Berlin on another project in January.
O'Donovan will eventually get the rent of the house because he works in extra shifts so he can pay his rent at home.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," she says, when the first one goes beyond the right of his own home for a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany at a house in Ireland where I'm not basically at all."
He laughs and walks in cold rooms.
The small house is in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, a large car park on the streets.
O'Donovan bought a house with a sister four years ago for EUR 380.000 - 100 per cent funded by loan.
"It was a crazy time, just money was without a lot of questions," she says.
Is he afraid it wouldn't work out well with the loan?
O'Donovan is thinking, there's a hot tea coming down, and he says, "I don't have children that I should live, and I'm young; even if everything turns back, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the call that he's hearing so often.
"No one should be hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as before on this island," she says.
"When you work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen -- maybe we'll feel like Irish first."
He laughs and then reports about his father who left for the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was back and his life went back to Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the open future and just wait for another life to develop.
He's been working in London for years, too, and why shouldn't it be on New Zealand for him and his friend too?
But there is another thing that worries him enough in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
They're afraid that she might turn around for the wedding celebration.
"There's no emotion," she says, and she's drinking well.
"Oh, my God, that sounds very disturbing."
"Let's call it a holiday celebration, totally simple, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of hers."
A common practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
The active activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey, which took place in 18 countries and went exclusively to The Economist magazine.
Since the study has been regularly carried out since 1995, it can monitor changes in existing areas above the whole area.
In the annual survey that took place in September and early October, two related things prevail.
The first is that Latin America has a relatively happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of the positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the Pacific Coast in South America has grown significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is averaged 6% per year from 2002 to 61% this year, the support for democracy increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy reacted to the profound decline in production in the late 1990s.
But only about half of the questions raised in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most sensitive areas, are the conviction of democracy, which is a regional dimension (see paragraph 2).
Nearly 44% of respondents throughout the region expressed satisfaction with the practical functioning of their country of democracy, the same figure as in the last year, but compared to 2001 when 25% was achieved, there was a large increase (clause 3).
The total of 34% indicated that they trust snow in their country and 45% trust the government, once again the same figure as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis was undermining democracy in Latin America.
Support was likely caused during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries were experiencing only a brief recession and were enjoying a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission for the United Nations Organization for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of the poor living in Latin America increased by 32% in 2009.)
However, it changes in a wide spectrum from land to land (see Figure 4).
The strong economic efficiency of Brazil and the popularity of its representative President Luise Inácia Luly da Silvy are reflected in a broad sense for progress.
This situation is more common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the situation of violent criminal activity deteriorated.
For the first time since the start of the investigation, more respondents have seen Latin America as the most important problem of crime more than unemployment (see paragraph 5).
The total of 31% says that either they or their close relatives have become victims of criminal activity in the last year, but this is a decrease compared to the 38% data last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The wider economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private enterprises and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprises are needed for development, this percentage has grown from 56% since 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that enables the development of their countries to increase this percentage from 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuela's respondents have the same opinion (and 80% support private enterprises), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, is owning many private companies.
Brazil is a country which has a leading position in the area as mentioned by 19% of respondents (about 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, around the last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, around 11% in the last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country in Mexico and in much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected that the general elections in Haiti would be perfect on November 28th.
But they were much worse than the outsiders who are trying to help the conquered country to be afraid.
The volleyballs were filled with screams and repeated voting, voting lines scattered across the channels, breaking free space and alarming.
Free rooms opened in hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced because of an earthquake, walked around and tried to find out where they could go.
Some of them finally gave it up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of pre-supposed presidents, complained that it was a fraud and called for a vote to be taken.
The protests, some of which were violent, spread throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, a highly established UN official in Haiti, declared that "in many respects it was quite a good choice."
Observers from the Organization of the American States and the Caribbean Community said carefully that "they do not believe that these inequalities, whatever they may be, should not necessarily be eliminated".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority whose opposition votes are bound by René Preval, the non-populated president and his candidate Jude Celestino, shall notify the preliminary results of 7 December.
The expected resolver file is scheduled for ice.
All voluntary hopes are not lost.
Two former opposition candidates Michel Martelli, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former lady, left their original challenge to be declared free of charge.
The problem may arise, however, if Mr Célessin, who has little or no support between the voters, will be appointed by the Electoral Commission for reaching a decision-making file.
As a result of a series of cholera epidemics and more than 1 million people who still live in states after the earthquake, they were worried that voluntary participation would be lower.
After all, many Haitians wanted to vote, but for the sake of de-organization, they were banned.
The total of 250 thousand credentials that are necessary for voting remain briefly before the elections.
There's a lot in the bag.
The donor sees the election of legitimate and popular governments as a fundamental step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear that the Haitians are based on it themselves.
After the spas, to the center
In the weeks when we arrived here, the Argentinian president, Cristina Fernández, from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Despite this success in the successful campaign for the second functional period of elections in the coming year, it may depend on whether Mrs. Fernández's frustration with her married husband, leader and political partner, Néstor Kirchner, has been compromised.
And that's what's going to happen.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in the economic policy and after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that were consistent with tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose their favor.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most of it in last year's Congress.
But the opposition was divided and further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political party of Peronist joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after the Chaotic meetings (which came to the falsification and prosecution of the corrupt government), Congress was unable to accept the 2011 budget.
"I don't agree to come," said the president.
The budget for 2010 will now also be paid for the next year, while the president will have more space to lose by grace.
The economy is overcrowded: this year it is likely to grow to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and committees are talking about the number approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who came to the office in 2003, when Argentina was experiencing economic collapse, placed priority on growth and poverty reduction rather than on inflation control.
He refused to associate with MMF, charged the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, a statistical agency that joined in monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now handle this policy?
She called for a consultation between private undertakings and committee transfers.
And her officials say they want to limit the growth of honey by 18% next year.
The economy was supported by a rise in world prices for the export of argent agricultural products.
However, inflation has broken down the growth based on the high inflation rate in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fernández is aware that he wants to renew the Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government entered into an agreement with debt holders who previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Ms. President Fernández's agreement with the faithful governments that are formed in the Paris Club, which owes $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this reality should not be controlled by MMF as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance", to propose a new national consumer-value index that would recall the introduction to the clean-up of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs. Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the functional period when the husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support from the middle class, which is inspired by Kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of Argentinians from the summer vacation they have in March, they will fall in love with sympathy.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether there will be a need to silence the many opinions that her husband has held in politics.
Half-fuelling for China
The Taiwanese voters are closer to a strong connection.
How does Taiwan feel about its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 billion voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on 27 November, and the city councils in five city councils, which can be considered to be the broader evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. President Ma is the sole representative of the sentiments which are firmly governed and firmly established in business relations, including agreements on partial free trade, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but it's just quiet.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) completed three of the five senior officials, he was unable to win most of the votes.
According to this Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is emphasised by Taiwan's greater independence, has gained almost 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If it were to talk about the presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has decreased by about 8%.
The first side of the DPP was with KMT in urban councils.
The volleyballs were played as the majority of Taiwanese volleyballs, which include partial volleyball cars and mass gathering with trainers competed with with abandoned girls.
The participants were even responsible for a secret attempt to attract attention.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, the distinguished president of KMT, was active for KMT candidates in the morning of the election.
The man from the roof shot young Mr. Lien clean up his face, hurt her, and killed a monster.
It was not strictly determined whether the armed forces intended to harm Mr. Liena or to settle disputes with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leading DPP, claims that the shooting affected the elections, suspects the DPP and leads the voters to KMT.
Almost the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained behind the question of her own strength.
Instead, the candidates started plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
KMT therefore has a tendency to avoid obligations to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also left behind the building of anti-China posts.
It is a reaction to the reality and to realize that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma confirmed for his part that China's policy is friendly for most Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing, it can be expected to continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the state.
China did not waste time sending a consignor to Taipei to organize a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, I would also like to see political integration, but the series.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP page, in any case, appeared on its own.
Two years ago she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of a charge of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a fugitive and a stay of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation developed, which is balanced and DPP works hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was invited as a DPP candidate to the president, for example Su Tseng-change, who stood by the office under Mr. Chen.
Their side is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutions which serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their operation can be carried out without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai reports to the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trust-based alternative" to Mr. Ma's inspired approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be upset with this crew.
In a statement issued by his own body, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they continued to be Taiwan's independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatics not to apply for president.
But without Mr. Chena's consent, DPP will fight the choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was wrong, even through the transition of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His lack of love seems to be largely based on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The speaker KMT says he reorganizes his cabinet, just like the local districts.
Strongly applied proposals for Taiwan's support for establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chianga, a prominent publisher, "the point from which there is no return, has already been withdrawn."
Nominations at Grammy price: Jazzzová song Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
Meeting at the president's request and people have to pay attention to the law.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to present the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, is marked as one of the most surprising Grammy prices this year with the awarding of the best new artist in the category.
In view of the fact that Spalding was a famous railway station since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the Grammy rule, when the artist must not issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her ambitious album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" has certainly marked the step forward and thanks to her ageless vocal style and her hands full of pop, fun and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that was recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to the voter in Grammy, who are looking for similar railway work in this category for the last year.
Jinde Journey Grammy rights rating the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, triggering, refreshing the ride of the album, which was a hot favorite in the late year.
Yesterday he will compete against the album by experienced saxafonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and the keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Thrombone Shorty, a graphic favorite from New Orleans and a distinguished guest in the HBO "Treme" series was rated in the current race category, which is otherwise pressured by Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlina and Jeff Lorber.
The divorced group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a number of awards in the category of big files when in competition it became a live jazz Children Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Paths" created a beautiful example of how to have a free hand as a capricious.
Nominations Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead to classic music category
Nominations in classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Grammy annual prices.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" have a piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
The Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", who was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Founder at L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance of rating.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, collection and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music year has five named Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Malinson.
The classic album was named Bruckner and his Symphonie Nos. 3 and 4 from Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacificium - the Art of the Castrate" introducing various artists; and Verdiho "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards categories of operations, the designations are Berg a "Lulu" from Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse a "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" from Orchestra and Chorus of the Marines' Theatre; a Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated for Grammy for modern stock, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionation Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graphiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a Prime Minister at Disney Hall in January 2009 at the exhibition, which was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the tactics of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is attributed to the former mining magnet of Mikhail Khodorkovski, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were appointed for the instrumental performance of the soloist with orchestra.
The editor of L.A. noted that he wrote 15 minutes of work especially for a mandolin interpreter Avi Avi Avital, who attended a concert with Metropolis Ensemble in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tuna from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Dirigent Pierre Bouledz, 85, received nominations for orchestral performance, for the guidance of Chicago Symphony when recording Stravinski's work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations are the pianist Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; the poet Paul Jacobs; the poet Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the famous vocal soloists were only women this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the class transition category, she obtained the names of the Sopranoist Jesse Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temcule receives approval from the planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of frequent public witnessing.
Critics attacked the project to promote terrorism and to bring it to an end.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local law and will be aesthetically effective.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"This means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are opposed only shout out loud."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting started at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost to midnight when most of the time people who were for or against the centre were interviewed. These voices were distributed equally, the Press-Enterprise gives.
The discussions continued on the Internet news pages.
"There's no America anymore," said one comment.
"We are the planet's prey to the soch free fall into the sand."
"America's dress."
The planned Islamic Centre also launched protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of the Ground Zero, a tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorist attacks took place in New York.
In the Temecula Valley I have Mahmoud Harmous violence condemned.
His religious family, who read about 135 families, joined the Riverside County after a year without an incident, but became larger and more suitable space than the warehouse, which he found together with the producer of filtration systems.
A new mixture of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and grow to a height of 43 feet.
She should take a place with a stretch of 4,32 acres [4.32 ha] on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still call the city council on the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its animals, expands the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and possibly further.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has the potential that stands out of the main properties that have been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has two abilities."
"It can grow either by phosphorous or arsenic."
"This reality is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of really 'immortal' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the news that appeared on Thursday in the online journal Science.
It was long considered necessary for the life of six main ingredients - oil, water, juice, acid, phosphorus and cheese.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after they are replaced by fossils.
"It'll start to impress you what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, co-author of the news.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, Anbar said.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this newspaper was published to discuss it, which did not reflect the details of the existence, caused widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reflects the appearance of foreign life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that cause biochemistry and that the seeds we consider to be 'standard' must not be so essential for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one member to another in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a convenient finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Symon from the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are very similar substances, considering that the microbe that is exposed to both cells can be able to replace each other.
"Arzen's adjective mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorous."
"As a result, organisms can be very difficult to separate these cells from themselves."
"But the arsenic is so different that it doesn't work as well as the phosphor. When it gets into the organism, it starts to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and produce an increasing concentration of arsenic, which are bacteria capable of adapting and growing.
Microbes grow better when phosphorus is in motion, but given that they can also survive with the rewarded arena, the possibility is that the shape of life that uses the arsen can naturally appear, either on Earth or on another planet or on the moon, where art is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of an arsenic, which could be replaced by a phosphorus, is not new, but never found an example on which this reality would have been proved.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that they could use the earlier forms of life.
"This means that there may be other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early days of Earth," Foster, who was not a member of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from Bellflower's motel were found, informing the sheriff of the Los Angeles area on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two objects and large pembroke corgis - broke into the afternoon when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, where they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel.
Two dogs were found in the middle of the afternoon and two dogs were left in the middle of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the police department for the Los Angeles area.
"The good news is the dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs were found, in which location, he did not share detailed information about their location.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We keep the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek were not caught up in the case.
They were very happy when in the middle of the afternoon their two objects were found in a dump in Downey.
Sheriff's representatives found out and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old fan Didi, were unharmed, transmitted by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to participate this week in the field contest on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unexamined until their appearance was late in the middle.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs had to compete in other competitions planned in the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek said the Times in the middle.
South California is only one stop for nearly a month on a couple's trip by dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard entered the motel.
They often sleep in the motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the boxer wall, the Parson Russell terier and the British hospital - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it should be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit so dogs can have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported stealing a car at 6:00 a.m. in the morning.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who's taking them to the missing dogs, and dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether the prices would be made.
Lev is ready again to withdraw now when the restructuring of MGM obtains final approval from the court
After 18 months of age and insecurity, MGM finally got green so that it could start again.
New York's federal insolvency judge officially won "before the hit" the creditors' plan to spend about $5 billion on debt and clean the way for 86 years old entertainment companies aimed at producing and producing films and television shows.
Fourthly, that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Competition Order does not remain a legal obstacle to the MGM in order to re-start the Spygles Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who are leading the successful study.
The number of staff is 320 from the originals of more than 400.
MGM shall not exclude this item from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase is not eligible for planned financial resources that allow a loan of up to $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
It is now connected to the investment bank, which needs 75 million dollars alone, and funding is expected around half a quarter of a week.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the management of its funds, as management was fighting to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
This August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former director-general of Enron's company, and an expert in the business, known for his work on Krispy Krem Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper tried to solve MGM financial problems and 140 students of the study lasted a long time before expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted a number of stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay 2 billion US dollars plus funds that the creditors demanded.
At the spring of the year, everything was back on the resurgence and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal turmoil, the plan was finally approved by the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from the competition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper companies will receive multi-haalion bonus in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will be paid $9.5 million.
Coopers, who pay for their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, i.e. a " Success Fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew the production in MGM, which has issued only one film this year and to bring together seven or eight films to be produced by the beginning of 2012.
They are also planning to participate in funding two films that the book "Hobit" will propose, together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share in the two films that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM debt, sought the opportunity to conduct a study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not end up in agreement.
Technology games that will keep your budget in balance
The leading candidate for the year is the most amazing iPad player, followed by the video hardware system. In both cases, it is one of the excellent principles of the award.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect is the same as 10 corals or about 48 pieces of Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your budget in balance.
I recently visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; the annual technology games have far more energy, and that at the same prices, if not less, compared with the past years.
While there have been relatively less new games with associated websites, two of the most famous games of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
It increases the number of players with button batteries, as well as the number of batteries offered.
Here are some recommendations.
(All the prices mentioned are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases which are otherwise specified.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years) are a flying animal that sings when you touch them quickly.
At one pressure, the animal produces a tone and the other pressure begins to form a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmonically.
Warning: Once you start smoking, you can’t stop.
The best choice in the combination of music and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I earned 14 hand-held animated women who can play the game of Simon Says and can also play the moons thanks to their innovatively complex legs with locking the wheel.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's game, even though their parents complain of lack of voice control.
If you are a child in the '80s, you might remember Alphee, one of the first computer learning games.
He's back, (hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a bag full of bicycles that are designed to change the ride into a business with a self-restraint, funny work bag.
If you send a smartphone to your child, there are three independent options.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the easiest option with easy use, with keyboards, although games do not have as effective as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first major change in the Leapster range from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with the older ones.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce her and e-books and has a slot on the SD card, which allows you to see family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children under 8 years) is a five-piece file, which are not larger than a stick box, each has a LED display.
The aim is to create words by placing a box in order before the time goes up; it is great for competition in improvised word creation.
Still more games have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two games were represented in the games, Webkinz and the Penguin Club.
If you want your child to buy an online game from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will get enough credit in the Club Penguin store on two voluntary posts.
This could include a chicken brush or a Puffle animal.
About a little bigger than your toothcard's closet is Hexbug nano (10$, for children under 5 years), the latest of a series of microbots on a button battery.
The bridge moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in the appropriate direction.
It's fun when you make a mess out of the church and you're watching if he can find his way out.
It's very slow, too.
This one of us was able to fall off the kitchen table and spend some time in the back of our dog.
Initiation of fairer police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin went to his place, carefully checking his orders and issuing orders with the military authority.
He wanted the women's members - the Chinese state officials of the city order, scared and terrified for their strong steps and entertainment in violence - to spend a certain amount of sleep on the hills surrounding them.
"Get up straight!"
" Hurry up!"
Show them, the hats are quiet, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive cassettes and cassettes stood in sight.
Four black boots are sorted according to the rules.
The four tops of the head are perfectly seated on the hair that are perfectly bound with blue and white hair.
"I personally think they seem average," said Mr. Tang in the meantime.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city inspectors in China.
One city ordered new branches to have high school education.
The province of Guangdong has changed the silk-green uniforms to a slightly more attractive fashion.
Wuhan in central China rewarded his strong-armed views: in one report, it was reported that in 2009 50 officials were unaccompanied and looked at the owners when the domestic salesmen broke and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city time of 680,000 people in Chengdu chose surgery as the main form.
Since 2003, he has supplemented his city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, orientation and age.
The aim is to show the police in addition to the rough pages of the police, also more attractive, women's side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have had trouble getting to the secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue the criticisms for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police are allowed only to file a city report, to issue accounts and other administrative procedures.
But Chinese media often attract a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei fired an unspoiled suspect to death after using his cell phone to find out how they began in the case of protest against the constable.
In the last year, police training was conducted in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, there was another description of how to effectively beat the priests without blood.
This year, he got a subcontractor with melancholy in Shanghai into a wheelchair with five police officers and suffered a left-hand brain injury.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet shows Chinese police how they attack street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, said last year after the next debate on tactics.
The paper was "very thorough cleaning."
Sceptics say that such a approach is not enough.
After integrating in October the interest of eight new women's police officers, the head of The Beijing Evening News asked whether women have real responsibilities or are only divided.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The period required female representations from 18 to 22 years of age with a good position and "five faces in the correct proportion."
The adaptives should be higher than the average - then greater than 1.6 metres.
The service at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say that work is psychologically too expensive for women over 25 years.
"Their images are important," said one of the most famous police officers on Rednet.com, such as government websites.
"The candidates must first show external qualities that then identify other, including heights, weights, facials, etc."
Then comes a series of behaviors and internal quality.
Women are like flowers, he said and added, "In addition to being pregnant, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the city of the district, does not agree very much with this description.
But he pointed out that higher requirements are also common in China for other jobs, and that is in both sexes.
The same as the requirement on the relative shape of the face.
Which means that the issue of good reflection is discussed between China.
Healthy swallowing or freezing is certainly useless.
"He can't allow us to serve a poor or ugly person," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch at Baoguang's place close to the monastery, has 22 years of age, faces like an apple and a pretty shaped mouth.
There's no doubt that she could have a sexual relationship, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
She's working with her dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the city's image."
They have no intentions against their limited performance, they say, because their career ambitions are greater than just getting merchants into the street where they can carry out their work.
Each morning the group stands against more than ten shoppers who run or on the streets and try to sell as many towels and tofu as possible before they lose.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, when the shopkeeper started running, and in time he left his bike with a car with nozzles.
Police describe their duties as more monotonous than inventive.
"Every day goes basically the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women's police don't have the right to be their male rivals so they can have the goods of salesmen.
They can only threaten that this reality is reported to their male leaders.
The trend is then to protect them against sudden public manifestations of hostility to the official device that are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of people in Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan, broke up after spreading false news that the police killed the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in night hours; 14 government vehicles were turned or burned.
Xindu's already escaped such violence.
But rest can be guaranteed only by difficulty.
Just two blocks from the quiet town of Baoguang, where the police were watching this morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
The police were having a motorcycle riding on a walker instead of in the shop, as required by the rules.
The owner of the car could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes away from the police, face-to-face, race-to-vehicles and get off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like women's police, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain and freeze images.
"Sometimes we fight verbatim."
"Sometimes we fight physics," said Mr. Li literally.
"Mostly it's the public that starts with it."
The prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensigna
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge involving his case with the former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced in the center of the senator's case.
The decision concludes the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Norwegian Republic, has faced and has been considered as a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 president. His case has been brought to national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said it was a decision that followed almost a year after the survey, "surely happy".
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings in the Senate Ethics Commission.
Lawyers Mr Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice "reported us that Senator Ensign would no longer aim to investigate and that it is not intended to make further accusations against him in this regard."
The Ministry of Justice refused to express the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal recruitment order.
Discussions, e-mails and other documents published in New York Times in October 2009 indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to Mr. Hampton's and his wife, Cynthia's silence.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton had hired them to steal so many documents and conversations.
As Hampton was a modern assistant to Mr Ensign, he was expelled from the law from the lobbying of his former employee or Senate for a year.
The ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were prior to the affair of friends, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
Among the evidence that was published was "the clear case of a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are investigating by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics specialists said that the Ministry was careful about political complaints, after a large number of accidents, including the decision to stop the appeal against former Senator Ted Stevens during the prosecution of a state-owned suspect.
The federal prosecutors "explosively hid weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the People's Organization for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that presented several problems with Mr Ensignov.
"It shows this in principle that the laws do not apply to high-ranking government officials," he added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Justice of Mr Ensign, delivered a speech on Monday that he was called by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then the second day, and told him that the Ministry had not been looking for any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensigna's opposition team is working with the complainant in an effort to convince him that the senator, as his authority repeated in the media announcement, "has agreed with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that he gave to the State agents.
"I am not pleased to think of the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Voluntary Commission decided to suspend an independent investigation of the problem in which the ethical group accuses the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents of a excess of $96 000 of the federal voluntary law.
The voluntary commission stated that she had no evidence to prove that the money had not been recorded in any other way than the gift.
One company for which Mr Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was the company NV Energy, the main Norwegian company that has been supporting a long-term senator.
An e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist, leading staff Mr. Ensign - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "buffed" to the Ministry of the Interior with regard to the item under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another non-governmental client, Allegiant Air, and called for the Minister of Transport to discuss a meeting on behalf of the airline after what Mr. Hampton will find at the lobby.
When the report of the affair was first published last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and rejected his position as a fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a multimonth stay, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third election period in Senate.
In the report, Mr Ensign no longer aims to investigate his spokesman Jennifer Cooper's criminal case, stating that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will follow the Ministry of Justice soon and complete the entire investigation.
"Senior Ensign is pleased to continue in his violent work on behalf of the people of Norway," she said.
Raises Cheshire's citizens turning to Twitter
In a series of court hearings, half of them were burned.
A minute later, they sent a message about a terrible witness over Twitter.
Finally, the survey says that more than 140,000 reports on Twitter have been made by violence and the bringing of children into the house that was burned.
On Thursday, the execution of Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced to the murder of three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, was to be terminated by the formal execution of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayese's lawyers have already appealed to the court with the applications and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most protracted is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this expanded, medialess disclosure of information with exciting details then introduced a jury in decision-making in a way that affects public opinion.
This claim could lead the judge to question whether the approach of new technologies would also require new rules in the Court of Justice.
"As I have experienced in this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the court of law affects the right of a fair process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief advocate Mr. Hayese.
The Court of Justice, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State, in its expert rejection of the statement of revenue from the past week and of the fact that the media were "fully controlled" and that there was no evidence to indicate that the jury was acting under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
Over the decades, the courts have acknowledged that the reporting of notary cases could raise questions of the justice of the proceedings.
In the 1966 Supreme Court of the United States, Dr. Sam Sheppard rejected the judgment of the Cleveland Chiropractic, for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard version Maxwell, due to the media, the "carnival atmosphere" was considered.
Some are convinced that this criminal act was inspired by television show and film "Awake".
Some lawyers said that the appeal court who examined Hayes' judgment about half a century later could be surprised by the argument that a new rule which sets out how to communicate with the Court of Justice, which was not representative in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, professor of law at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out voluntarily.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be concerned with the idea that the restriction of uninterrupted communication by means of a court-martial procedure can make the process more just.
The Twitter incident is only one of many stressed lawyers, Mr Hayes, who would be able to argue the years for the execution of the judgment to be held.
The prosecutor also claims that in the case of Mr Hayese, he may be premeditated if Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential judges by showing them criminal pictures of the threat in the jury's selection.
Some of the judges said they were scared of the victim's photograph that happened to Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defendants claim that they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge has wrongly dismissed a judge who has been critical of the state officials and that in his decision he has not put greater pressure on the verdict and has directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The kids weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process on the scope of the process can be of the greatest interest.
They pointed out in the contest against the verdict held last month that the case was dominated by a report in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of candidates to the Governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly exaggerating the emotions of this case.
"The daily record of media, cameras and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that was not seen here in New Haven before and one might also be about the whole state ranking."
Their focus on Twitter movement is controversial.
In the discussions, some journalists claimed that the unambiguous presentation of the message was more disturbing than the reports mentioned earlier and that the judicial police should, in their view, conduct a field of other processes.
However, some lawyers called for appeals to the courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of the courts.
Mr. Hayese's lawyers are working on this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 on the matter of Dr. Sheppard, because of the broad process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "shows the Sheppard version of the 21st century Maxwell."
Can the wild beast overcome the curse?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its vulnerability and negative, this week in Washington, there was a small number of zoos.
Is it the first real owner to cooperate with two political parties, or is it just an illusion moment before the quick return to the foreign war in the capital?
The second meeting of President Obama and Parliamentary leaders did not provide any basic information on the main issues to be discussed during the meeting.
In each case, however, there was a two-way debate that agreed on the differences in views, as well as the definition of their joint responsibilities, rather than the empty episode of the party's engagement.
The general public meeting of the presidential deficit committee was also civilized, even through the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the close presence over a period of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological destruction that the members continue to divide.
And it's pretty easy to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the test period - they are harming each other's signs of college and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the Volcano's tolerance against the renewed foreign war.
Therefore, it was also held on Tuesday and its subsequent evaluation of participants, with minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to propose a rapid change in the measurements that are taking place here in the last two years.
Whether it's about tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least as soon as possible.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The volleyballs broke the emotions of the guests and then they ran away.
It's good."
In a number of issues, especially those to be held at the meeting, the Republicans and democratics have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut was lifted at the end of the year, and no one thinks that it's acceptable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, and this is lasting or temporary.
As a possible compromise with regard to the duty in unemployment, only because the Republicans are unable to look at how they support the reduction of taxes on the property while the unemployed refuse unemployment support.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, it is already seen more optimism about possible agreements on these issues, together with ratification of the new enthusiast contracts.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress is convened on the afternoon.
It's more likely a period of uncertainty, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that have to be done, psychology will soon return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is, to a considerable extent, extended - to the fact that creativity leads to real cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and the year 2012 as a string box when major events take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
The Republican leaders are now facing a dangerous challenge, knowing that they must act in accordance with their promises and that they must reduce government expenditure and repeal a new health care law.
These cross-border lines are clear in initial responses to recommendations on deficits, which include the reform of tax legislation and the increase of certain taxes, the rise of pension age and the reduction of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken up one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, have developed the pressure of deficit issues to the public programme in a way that cannot be ignored.
However, 14 votes are required in the 18th Committee so that they can present their plan as a formal recommendation and then fight to get closer to this number as soon as possible.
The greatest contradiction is between the elected officials in the court who propose that we have, at least today, small funds or wills for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first year will begin in the form of foreign conflicts when the Republic of Obama develops a solution to budgeting, taxation and health care, when the period of greater foreign cooperation will follow.
What's going on?
Public opinion.
There is plenty of evidence that despite the fact that the last elections, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could be directed towards the path, as it was in 1995, then both sides will closely follow the public's reactions.
Anyone will risk lowering his voice, likely changing his course, and will seek compromise.
This could be an optimistic view of the matter.
Foreignism and direction are now bigger than it has been in the mid-1990s and shows that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republics than in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
Similarly, both sides see 2010 as a front for the most important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the jealousy that this week has shown itself to be encouraging to many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
The express American document refers to Moscow as an attack on corruption
The city's management is in the hands of a "kleptokratia" and it continues to cover some of the charges and charges for the way to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia has sent out reports from the U.S.
The police and the Federal Security Service have a great deal of protection clauses that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Each type of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the office's vertical" - takes himself when the money starts to climb over the top of the bridge.
The record that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrleh was published in the medium via WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at the time Yuri Luzhkov was still old and accused her of much corruption.
He was elected in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only follow the minimum changes in clarity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, whose own prominent construction company, have continued to blame corruption for many years, and has won several complaints for such a charge.
In September he said to the Russian television station when he was asked about the evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupt, it will be shown to vote.
It is also unusual to meet with such details in such a way as to be mentioned in a bilingual report, and it is also unlikely that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its association with criminal lives led some to call it 'disfunctional,' and confirm that the government works more than the cleptocratic," says the report.
"Criminal elements are pleased with the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'stretch' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the State Representative, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics have identified and a threefold structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luchkov is on his own top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the Military are at second level."
"And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in certain areas, as some city does not provide services."
The report says that the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police is focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "the owners of trade in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (more than organized criminal groups) because they have not only weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by the law."
"That's why protection from criminal gangs is no longer in practice."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself may already have trouble; and those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay too quickly will end their trade under different conditions.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but he admitted that he had only made little progress.
The Ambassad report speaks of men carrying suitcases, probably driven by the cookage, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Indem in recent conversations.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"There is no political class, because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without sharing power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Another estimates that Russia's corruption is worldwide more than $300 billion a year.
The country is scheduled for the 154th place in a recent study on the global perception of the corruption of the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the country is divided by at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the report by the US Embassy that appeared in Moscow until late evenings certainly did not call the Russian government overcrowding, even if only to the extent that the Moscow deficit could be blamed for Luzhkov, this could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue in the matter of solving the problem.
In his interview with the CNN, Larry Kinggem told Putin that documents published by WikiLeaks could be tablets and responded to the statement that American diplomats call him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The whole issue is that it is our mutual involvement, which is an important factor in home policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't assume that this would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethical."
Veterans of Red Khmer are forced to match the past
In the dispute of bright concrete lessons, the director of the Anlong Veng High School, who presented it, reminded the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok school.
"Everyone here loves the Moca."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
The leader of this distant country of the Rudj Khammer in the northwestern Cambodia, known as the "riznik" for its cruelty during the Rudj Khummer government, remains popular, where he has set up hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers are still alive.
But this year, 12 years after Rudi Khmer's government was released, a long-term loyality was also acquired in Anlong Vengo.
In depth, the victim of truth was allowed to face publicly those who were part of the regime.
In June the government provided teachers who first explained the history of Red Khmer and their former soldiers.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian Court of First Instance of the former member of the Red Khmer, the ruling of a former leader, the notary of the known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, for 35 years in prison.
With any such progress, he grew apart between the veterans of the Red Khmer in Anlong Veng, which is complicated by efforts to re-enter Cambodia.
"Among the former Rudy Khmery, they're afraid and afraid, but they're powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian documentary center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them life was beautiful between Rudy Khmery, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates the family."
During the Rudý Khmmer government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were treated or died of hunger, disease or treatment.
When the Vietnamese attacked and invaded the government of Paul Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers were on the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last stop in December 1998.
Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Party's wars from their bases in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated the stage in Anlong Vengo.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer fighters began to cross into the government that raised the capitals Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was employed by government forces in nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their lovers no longer cared for them, most of the former warriors of the Rudj Khmmer have moved into the ordinary Cambodian foreign life and many of them are nostalgicly mentioned during the strike.
Although several elite Red Khummers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Peace, which leads a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They're surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"There were no representations of the conduct of the trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengo before he sat as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under Rudy Khmer was good," he said.
"That Mok enjoyed it all."
"But now life is hard because we have to make sure of it ourselves."
The passing court of the Red Khmer has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will start investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of Rudý Khmer.
The Court should be ordered to arrest the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it was not said whether it would continue in the four cases.
It was just a little bit to calm down anxiety in Anlong vengo.
The recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, which was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey during the Rudí Khummer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia told her that she had taken note of the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably lost thousands of employees.
Im Chaem had recently returned from work to his wooden house on a spinal road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the walls appeared over the clean grass, Im Cham refused to talk about his past between Rudy Khmery.
If the judge had called her, she would have refused to go.
"The government peace in Cambodia and it's stable," she said.
"If there is another criminal incident, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Red Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that he would come to instability if the court was looking for further suspects, although the experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury in it the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentary center.
"The direction in the Khmer scale means the blinding of broken bones," he said.
"Our duty is to give these broken bones together so that we can understand."
The Centre issued the first teachers approved by the government of Rudy Khmer, with 75 pages and the name "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addendum to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Rudy Khummer.
Just like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengu knew only a few details about the Rudy Khmers, even through connecting the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new teacher helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to the studio.
"My family rejects a lot of teachers and judges," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be judged."
Such opposition makes the reconciliation process more complex and more difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forum, the teachers and the court are starting to influence, he sent on.
The Rudi Khmer here still has a strong compass.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains, the road is paved with swimming pools and is filled with decorated plastic bags that lead to the dealer of black bags covered by a cut-off stick.
Paul Pota's body was buried here on a monumental pneumatic after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman at the end of the road said he doesn't know much about the men who were buried there.
"But I have a strong spirit, many local people go here and pray to him," she said.
Sothea was born and was later planning to visit Paul Pota's place of rest, where she would bring a bunch of grown bananas in hopes of making her happy.
Belarus agrees that it seems to have its weapons on the basis of uranium
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign on the security of nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced that their stocks of highly contaminated uranium are being exposed, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the security summit of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergey Martinov.
After years, the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to develop a highly contaminated uranium and it seemed that the last year had passed.
But the U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a number of armed operations were carried out with Belarus to remove 187 free weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared a ground for the mid-term agreement to remove the remaining material - about 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke under the terms of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Summit on Nuclear Security in the depth at which Belarus was listed.
And it was obviously good to ensure that the former Soviet Republic was invited to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 nuclear security summit."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Lugo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement a "great, important step" from Belarus.
Both of them promised in Prague in April 2009 that they would secure all sensitive nuclear material throughout the world for four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their resources of highly contaminated uranium.
Belarus will be seven.
Thousands of countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukašenko announced that his people would never take up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the base for weapons and less sophisticated uranium," said Lukašenko.
"It's our comedy... we're not going to produce spy bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago, Belarus joined the United States and expressed its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily detected by officials.
He was put on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian reconciliation and liquidation facility, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by plane, the officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the programme, most of which is spent on the provision of a White Research Institute with less-fashioned uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"It was very carefully coordinated and conducted on the basis of confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniewski, director of the Energy Ministry working for Global Three Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 free uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint declaration, force its stocks to be removed by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained throughout the year, especially because of the harsh repression of human rights by Lukašenk.
But the average declaration indicates the possibility of a gradual silence.
"We see progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus, that further maintenance of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and that is necessary for the progress of the country and its citizens," he said.
The Spanish government didn't do it with CIA's planes.
The Spanish Government did not make any comments about the years of the CIA carried over the Taliban and the members of Al-Qaida to Guantánamo over the Spanish territory, as expressed in their telegram of the United States of America in Madrid.
Thus, it is from documents provided by Wikileaks dean of El País, where he also writes that the former prime minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vego, requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "may show that he has a proper view of the other flights flying the Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a communication by the Council of Europe, in which thousands of States, including Spain, were charged with human rights violations, a meeting was held between the United States High Representative Eduardo Aguirre and the Fernández de la Vegovo.
The prime minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "has removed Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegová stressed that Spain has no problem with the years of secret service across its territory.
"They just want to be informed", so as not to be "sustained unprepared", Aguirre reports in one of the documents.
The former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this issue as much as possible, but because it was in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told Velvyslandev that in his case, he did not intend to block the court's initiative to request the withdrawal of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA years.
"This information does not contain any criminal content or any sensitive information," explained Velvyslanecvi after talking with the prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed more concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the removal of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will be complicated by our efforts to resolve this case discrepancies between governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, when the U.S. and Minister of the Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby held this statement, "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they will believe is appropriate," he already instructed his colleagues "to avoid perceived comments with a view to reducing tension".
The President also expresses his concern about the political party of the Party of Popular (PP; Czech Party of Lidová - see Minutes) in this regard.
"Even with its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the party of the People's Party will not hesitate to use any hints that Zapatero's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the United States union, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if this disclosure could have negative consequences for the government of the United States," he notes.
Appointed mother-killer was struggling online on the mother's "age" network.
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog, "Teror after the Galician."
Monica Juanatey Fernández says on the Internet "Muki".
With this impression she had already used, she communicated with her sister and at least one friend; both of them are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruní, where a young woman comes from.
The messages have been in 2008.
For them to be able to understand, a woman must know the life of a living, which the ABC data rebuilds with the testimony of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They walked together for one year.
Shortly after the divorce, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if he was his newborn baby, but his ex-friend never stopped doing DNA tests.
You've recently found a new identity.
Her name was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousam.
Their connections lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the girl stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week to Palmy.
However, it is clear from the content of her communication that the relationship was broken.
In March 2008, he's on his own to Menorce and says, "Alberto's some anger that I went to work."
"When I told him that, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he has to be with a little day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about a text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I'm going to send your child."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave my little mother, I'll take him when I get back."
in May she talks about her return to her apartment: "I'm going to eat there this week, but I'm only going to 19 because I have to go to work to avoid this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, we'll take our son to ourselves.
"It will be with who to be with me, and it will never happen in my life that I will leave him with someone other than my mother," the wrong purpose is given to her bad relationships.
There's another contribution here in July.

People would get 4 cross-sections in Snow and PSC (Socialist side of Katalánska - no.) would lose 9 mandates
with the results of 28 November, the PP party may have the main word in the workshops in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the votes received and the number of experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Lidova side of Catalan - see above) already has an idea of the general elections, whether it is already up to or never, its views are more positive than the number of votes in national elections, since it is usually one such turn for the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received a total of 610,473 votes in general, while in the 2006 autonomous elections this number was only 316.222.
Last week, PPC (Lido side of Catalan) received 384.091 votes.
If this trend is maintained, supported by the transmission of votes from the PSC and the loyality of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were to be completed, the PPC could have 12 Members in the Smömovy to counter existing 8, the CIU side (Convergence and Union, Czech Court and Union) would also have 4 mandates (now having 10, and PSC would have lost at least 9 circles (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalan has a key role for PP and PSOE (Spain Socialist Party) parties.
According to this analysis of the population, the ERC (Levico Republican side of Catalan) would have lost one delegation - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalan - Others) would still have one mandate, where appropriate, another one.
However, according to the voluntary calendar, the most recent delivery will end in May 2011 on the occasion of the current elections, where people can also have a decisive impact on the end of the rule of socialists in four main provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the most anticipated budget administrations - EUR 661 million for 2011.
As nationalists, people agree with the possibility that PSC could lose workshops in Barcelona, Tarragon, Léride and Geroní, where socialists would not receive most and not be able to turn to their traditional connections, the ERA and the ICV parties.
It would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representation - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% votes.
The PP page has increased the number of votes won in four main cities and could have a decisive impact on Barcelona, Léride and Tarragon.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the operation in Tarragon, where they ruled alongside the PP before the current age, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP received only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose elderly Angel Ross had very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also obtained other important workshops such as Badalon, Casteldalels or Reus.
At present, the PP has a representation of 34 workshops in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many cities as possible.
The Catalan bunker has provided the Al-Kaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian detained agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, created a Jewish station in Thailand, which included travel passports to various groups of Al-Qaida organisations, including the "Tygri liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second group was the author of the bombings, with 106 persons missing in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, which aims to ensure that the "operation of the Campai" weakens the Al-Kaida distribution device at international level and "so limit its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that during two years when the bono was active in Catalan, it was possible to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then distributed and then supplied to groups that created the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaida organization so that their "warmen" could travel safely across the borders of Europe and other Western countries.
This broken hole was not the only active one that had the Jahad network in Europe, and therefore these investigations, in addition to the Thai services, were also carried out by other European police units, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that it will not come to other European countries on similar grounds, as it was last night in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agungbiade) developed further in Thailand, while Pakistani Muslims Muhammad Athhar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikallaya Kijbumrung were occupied.
It was just the men who took the lead in the Bangkok bunkhouse living in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, whose share was damaged in 2009, was particularly stolen by tourists who met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, must have been in force for several years and be without marked visas.
In the investigation documents, it was stressed that there is still no fact that would be associated with the bombing in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it is clear that a few days before this attack, about $1,000 was sent from the Catalan Translation Agency, which was "inserted" to purchase a card on mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" who killed 106 people.
The police already had a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to terminate the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (Lidova side of Catalánska) Alicia Sánchez-Camakhova had the opportunity yesterday to present to Arturo Mass his personal terms, for which he was willing to support his introduction to the President-General's role; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is economic recovery and the return of venturers as an economic agreement that the leaders of nationalists intend to propose during their term of office.
The president of the Catalan Peoples met with Artur Mass with 18 parliamentary crises held during the last week's elections, which was more than satisfactory to get a job, so the CIU candidate needs at least one of the formations of the opposition to hold a vote on his arrival at the office.
As far as possible, the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists in the Snow would want to maintain when the general elections are to be held, but discussions that lead in these days with the rest of the political leaders are not in the Catalan spirit.
With regard to the President of the PP, in order to obtain her support for the introduction of the function, "it will have to end with all the achievements and liberations", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque - on which the leader of the CIU even wanted to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to boost the overcrowded political system of self-government and reduce parental and donor taxes.
Details of the merger regarding Masov's entry into function will be left under the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat page.
The mass had already met with Joaquin Nadala (PSC), who had promised strong opposition, Joan Herrerou (ICV) and today is with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Citadans) and Joan Laporto (Solidaritat Catalana).
The manager of the geriatric device shall ensure that no death occurs due to "a failure of action"
The exhibitions of the Centre of Olot do not indicate that their baker killed more than 11 customers
The leadership of the Geriatric Center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to remedy the damage caused by the authorities of the criminal behaviour of Joan Vily Dilmé, a baker, who, in the meantime, was employed here - killed at least one hundred seniors who were in care.
The director of this house for seniors Joan Sala brought into force the lawyer of the facility, Joan Canady, and announced that "the admission of the house of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty" responsible for the murder, and "the law and responsibility force force us to give up this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to a good name, which can be endured by this institution because it has not at the time abandoned the criminal activities of the bakery, the great threat to the house of La Caritat now poses the requirements for material damage already being calculated by the legal representatives of the rest of the family.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was committed in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight clients at home for seniors with the suspicion that in many cases no dead doctor had personally visited, although, in view of the age and the poor condition of patients, everything was sorted by telephone.
La Caritat, through his director, strongly rejected this nationality yesterday and stressed that "the lack of action could not in any case be due to what happened".
Legal representative La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party would be allowed to make a mistake other than its own defendant".
The man who is now quoted as "Angel die" admitted 11 deaths yesterday and confirmed that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and that he was killed by a second elder about a month and a half later.
In this case, death caused too high insulin doses, different from the first case when using a mixture of comforting tablets.
Director La Caritat indicated that it is complicated to control staff access to medications.
Insulin and sedative cocktails were likely in six cases from the nine means used by this sedative to help patients die in their efforts to relieve them from suffering.
However, the first analysis that is currently being carried out in the laboratory should show if Vila did not and actually was looking for his first victim less severe death or killed by the use of leukemia, as he admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat does not believe in medical claims, nor does it mean that the number of murderers can be higher than the one he admitted to, and justify their behavior in various versions given by Vila to the court with the knowledge that he must change his conduct when it became apparent that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say they want to be just enough to shed light on the scope of this concern.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Investors responded yesterday yesterday to the threat posed by President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The regional differences were compounded by the force and the shares of the European Bank amounted to more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to lie - the euro is just above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, although it is due to decline, is also due to a short and very speculative position.
Investors will have to wait a while before they lose their fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to take back the liquidity measure today, and tomorrow it will have to be postponed for a quarter of a year.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the State debt recovery plan and the elimination of all excessive liquidity measures over time and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the liquidity measure will be "minimumly marketed" and will receive a three-month tender with unlimited access to the end of this quarter in order to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue to purchase debt in their programme and that they will even make known its intensity.
If an unexpected expectation is created, it will again create market reactions from yesterday, and if they continue to be blind in the pursuit of liquidity, God is with us!
The same was at the meeting in May, where they claimed that they did not even consider buying debt documents, and came to the market collapse tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and sustainable.
In May, it announced the Panther Road on Monday, and in the middle it announced that it had already bought a lot of them, leading to a further deterioration of the market.
Yesterday's bid for a year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of previous prices.
As a result, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in market conditions that followed the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, figures were published representing losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent a total of 10,000 million on short-term securities and 15,000 other potentials, with the possibility of becoming a private capital, otherwise being frozen.
Although Ireland has no credibility, since the problem has not been resolved in July by stress tests, the amounts are acceptable and help to reduce insecurity within the framework of the aid plan.
However, the next day, the government will need to gain the approval of the new budget by Parliament and there will still be insufficient support, so there will be further uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has slowed down the tone of her appearance in order to release the tension in the face of the next EU summit of 14 December, on which it is necessary to come to a political compromise that would show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner while the others would rather be Beethoven's son for joy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatization, employment recovery measures - to other investors it sounds like the Four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Tricheta and Zapatera explains why the Spanish bourgeois has grown by 4.5%, and therefore twice as much as the other European bourgeoises.
Unlike the U.S., the government's reaction and the Spanish National Banks were quick and convincing - we're hardly surprised.
Today we have a key bid for a loan for three years, which will be offset by Trichet's effect, which we hope will be a big demand that will help to raise doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain's suicide.
They would give us what we don't need - in El Tesor there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would close our days.
However, it is necessary to continue to use Caesar's wife's strategy - "not only to be it, but also to seem it."
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group will attack Vega Sicilia's company company with his children
In the open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, are not affected.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will then attack what he considered to be "the whole unfathomable", El Enebro's legal meeting planned for the 16th month and the required five of his seven offspring, on which they should try to exploit their majority and strengthen with the help of the administrative authorities of the Bodegas Vega Sicily company.
David Álvarez and his son Jesús David and María José govern the legal group for the new chapter of their dispute on the governance of the part of society.
The founder of the largest maintenance of business services shall not be willing to settle in his dispute on the membership of the ruling El Enebro group.
From its Administrative Committee, five of its seven descendants were named transfers during the gathering of shareholders on 18 January of this year and their object is included in the Trade Register.
The hearing of the El Enbro group scheduled for the sixteenth month, which was approved by the Chamber of Commerce No. 2 in Madrid, reopened the funeral of the family of Álvarez.
The appeal to the Court is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means which ensures the Commission's vote.
The last step of Juana Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elviry of Álvarez Mezquirizov are considered by David Álvarez to be "a reliable middle of his five children serving with the court order and a clear legal basis for strengthening and improving the 18th century, which was completely free of charge".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack on this conduct as a "all unnecessary".
Self-protagonists who are discrepancies have already tried without success to call the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicily, controls seven descendants of David Álvareze 100% capital.
However, according to the family protocols, the Group's founder requires the right to use 51% capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide on the matter of a court attack. The date of the hearing has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes perfection in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered Formula 1 series in 2004, his story in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one had taken too seriously the possibility of this new coming team, and despite the rising trend of recent years, all were on the triumph of Ferrari Fernanda Alons.
Before we want to lower the driving skills of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world Formula 1 was born a legend - a "secret weapon" that the international Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to do so as a winning team.
In fact, it is an effective software that simulates the entry of a German company into the market in 2007 for a very distant car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to propose assembly lines in production companies around the world, in energy racing and for high-quality equipment.
Its objective is to reproduce the product faithfully or simulate the process before it is actually created, which can avoid excessive mistakes and expenses.
The PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, the leading industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software enabled Red Bull team to perform "over a few hours, almost real time" modifications and perfections that are otherwise detected during the race and test.
Russwurm says that in 1992 average 10 technicians were employed, who were able to perform at least three or four perfectings over a period of one period.
in the Red Bull team today works for 180 highly qualified professionals with an efficient information technology that analyzes and proposes any type of vehicle modification.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all the elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety properties are modified.
Changes can be transferred from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced manufacturing systems using laser and highly technologically successful automobiles.
The only limit for this technical facility is the amount of $40 million representing a maximum of which can be issued by each Formula 1 team for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull organized a 50 km hole from London race of spy technologies for the design and production of his racing vehicles.
It's about two buildings that are restricted by access to, especially for journalists.
Everything that's playing here is considered to be a "great mystery."
The list of participants in this project reads 580 persons, including two pilots - Vettela and Mark Webber.
Herdino Red Bull is in Formula 1 without any doubt a clean Sebastian Vettel champion.
Under the disproportionate technological means that the brand of energy drinks has contributed to its participation in the racing circles, other protagonists are also hiding their help, which is invaluable, and no one knows.
Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was the driver's crew.
At present, this measure has changed and technology is considered to be 85% success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that the Vettler or Webber will never be replaced by the accounting technique, since they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will conduct its own business in cooperation with local distributors for two years.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with his business partner Pont Reyes opened his first exclusive sale in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first from the network of 20 shops with a range of 80 to 100 m2, which this international company plans to open in Spain for the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing shops such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of the Spanish HP Helena Herrerov mentioned as an example a newly suspended sale to the Barcelona Gran Vía, a company belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has reached a plan for the installation of 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest, Romania, and in Belgrade, Serbia, and the trade in Barcelona was then the third.
Herrero didn't want to reveal where another sale would be opened, yet she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrero, which also runs the HP staff system, has assured that the opening of trade philosophy will still be the same - with the use of local distributors who have industry's experience and expertise.
The North American company here deals with the exclusive design of equipment sold (with products that can be tested interactively) which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also responsible for ensuring business staff.
Helena Herrer said that it would be Frankishing, and emphasized that the exclusive network was sold to "improve customer service, services for small and medium-sized enterprises in the purchase, service, sales service and even the coast".
The trade in Barcelona is part of the global pioneer programme, which is designed to address any problems with computer devices in the future.
The online service is proposed with a technical centre based in Maastricht, New Zealand.
"So we'll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes, which can otherwise last for up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contract service of technical assistance," said Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sababell's on the "crowd" for three years with his competitors, millions of customers.
More optimistic than any other chief, a delegated member of the Bank Banko Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a guarantee for the bank, but will reject the new liquidity crisis and predict the end of the passive war.
It is still calculated by lowering the rates, but will try to compensate for the decrease in bank payments and credit prices.
Sababell expects him to be able to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years and the power to survive in relatively simple economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public aid in the FROB, to get a share on the market by attracting millions of new private customers - 700,000 respectively, if those who, in the event of a bank leave - as the constitution has so far attracted small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises than small customers.
This year the bank has already acquired 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its share in the market makes it more than 10% of private customers.
Another of the fundamental ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it can also be said that the cost of reducing the costs shown by the bank will be reduced when the results for the period are presented.
Some banking institutions are currently considering setting goals and publishing them as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking industry.
This year Sababell will close its Optima programme, established four years ago, although initially in three years, the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Customers who leave the facility will be their main target group.
At a meeting organized by the APIE, Guardiola held that 2011 will be "hard and very important".
It is thought that the journey from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, for two or three years it will be "very easy to create employment", which is essential for the survival of the banking sector.
And while he believes that the passive war - which reduces the margins - will rise, the price of the risk indicator that banks and the sponsors pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity is already being transferred to the prices of loans that compensate for the reduction of the margin.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural and will represent a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the door yet, but the differences are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday order to reduce long-term loans and raise the price of differences - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trend in banking "is now a downturn", but here is a "competitive framework".
The Sabadell Bank's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It does not guarantee free will that in Spain, "they will demand more."
"The next year won't be left on stone," he said.
It affirms that capital needs are "adequately reduced" and does not mean that some Spanish institutions enter between red numbers.
And it shows that FROB can scale up the collection of funds in the market before the new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sababell can survive the temporary closure of the market, it continues to pose a serious problem for some bankers to predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through repo the rate, which is mitigating the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of fussed
The Director-General of the CECA rejected yesterday that another wave of fuss should be triggered and resumed at the speed of reorganization of the sector.
When the process of combining Spanish partners started, several institutions were assured that this first phase was not involved and are waiting for a second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation (CECA) Mr José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday announced that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, that Cajasol's incorporations in the Bank of Civica can't be considered as second round, that's what's happening are the contracts."
"The majority is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions, we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are ready and protected by the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well in this regard," the manager noted.
In his statement at the ADEA meeting (Association of the leading and executive officials of Aragon - see above) Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is being carried out "as soon as possible and we must be very comfortable as it is shown in payments that have not yet appeared in the Spanish National Bank's business plans", he stressed.
"To move out of 45 associates with an average active volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and, therefore, in accordance with the Basilian Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta recognized that "there is a number of unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process", which indicate "the lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be in the end of the year".
The CEO of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday made sure that Spain has the closest financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and those who doubt it were "insufficient knowledge".
The editor noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be comfortable" with regard to financial institutions and partners and the system which has managed "very important" concentration process and which continues "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spain’s banking was very good at the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set conditions for the Union as a whole.
The pressure on the markets led to two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, from a reduction in the tax for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of the private media agency or the cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed without a duty, until 49% of the AENA (Spain airport and air traffic management), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, joined the criticisms at the office of Angely Merkel because of her responsibility for resolving the current crisis.
How to interpret this motion?
It has been said that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
Rather, it is the next item in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what his future should be, which marks on the idea of keeping old traditions, which hold much of the rest of the members.
Faces in the face of European reconciliation in Germany are beginning to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but for example, Rakousko or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the mechanized zone.
The second is to return to March - although it can now be seen as a scissors, this version has wide public support, which is close to 50% of the population.
The third option is according to the German proposals for the processing of the euro with greater macro-economic surveillance, accounting presence, procurement costs for the provinces, possible reimbursements for some of them, and the expansion of possible costs for the regulation of the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there's no space for the drawings now.
First of all, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission undertook deficits in 2009, the German government has launched a constitutional reform in order to prevent them since 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be the right (the plans of fiscal presence and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners did, including France.
The other showed this Mediterranean country when Merkel’s disease challenged the Greek rescue decision.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel's position was expressed with a clear view when it called for reform of the European Union's treaties so that it would be possible to save some Member State and at the same time to have a private trust obligation to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as a counter-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and all the others.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat moderate manner, has been approved, and we should follow up on the Union reform process, which should allow these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has crossed a red line that is unable to cross.
And it tells us that although it is now necessary to take measures that are clearly not in agreement with it, this date will end with the old functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will represent the rise of new exchange zones in which Member States are severely penalised and may be forced to report a delay of payments, and the private sector will also have to pay part of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to make a sharp path to growth by increasing support and investment, moderate consumption, productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option is based on search and construction, with massive balances in the payment balance sheet, which governments in the years ahead of Spain's growth are simply not able to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not just about the renewal of the public deficit by 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope these current turbulence will bring greater relief.
And we're using the opportunities they give us until spring 2013.
It appears that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) indicate that through criticism at Merkel's address, he opened the way of thinking that things should be done.
However, the red line that Germany has crossed is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities you can consider, you cannot fully exclude the euro area from the serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rules
The fines that Alonso and Ramos have predicted in the game with Ajaxe show the depth of their intention never to avoid punishment.
It was thought that the release of two players from Reala Madrid (Xabiho Alons and Sergio Ramose) in the League of Masters against Ajaxu on 23 November made it possible to write a sea of inconsistencies as to whether this is non-portable behavior and whether UEFA should not be seen by both football players.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly won) the naming of the players lost the time after the other, at the time he had to play faul so that they would provoke the judge, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way both players will be fully punished in the next match against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end in its group on the head - and they will be able, free of charge, to proceed to the next phase.
In the end, the UEFA disciplinary commission sentenced coach José Mourin to two games and convicted players received a monetary penalty.
The production of yellow cards under similar conditions is not a new practice, although most of them are common in the fotball.
It's so wide that it's part of the etos of the photoball, so the rules that are not written yet, but follow.
The part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was a Real Madrid team (which in his imaginative softness and respect, which has already been devoted to the actions of his players), and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization of Mourinhem, which thus contributes to his long history of comedians and advocates of another episode.
In any case, the debate concerns whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, and whether it comes to the exercise of the law; one is the effect on the action of the respective sports rules, which the meaning of which seems to be intended to be concerned.
It's said what kind of damage such conduct causes a sports spirit.
One of the proper sports behaviour is the physical incompatibility of players who were not injured in these cases did not appear to have come to violent game.
Another of these appropriate features of the pure game is to avoid the fact that players, thanks to their rebellion, have against the opposite team of benefits - which did not come here either.
So the paradox to the action of the players of Real Madrid is the fact that it did not come to what we normally characterize as a letter or law enforcement, did not come to a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, although this behavior should be the most appropriate with the aim of punishment.
They waited and they loved punishment.
The next question is, however, what benefits will the guilty ones will have from their deliberate rebellion?
There is a need to find out that the competition does not reach an uneven position and that there is no benefit in the current game, as it is evident from the fact that the team will have fewer players alone.
And it's not even a useful strategy in another game, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The outcome clearly starts with the players starting another phase of the League of Masters without a card, which could threaten their participation in future events.
However, the benefit of long-term perspectives and with certain degree of uncertainty can be eliminated by the team, and in spite of this meeting, the players will be reimbursed, and they will pass into the second wheel of the cart, where one card is worth less than one card in the first wheel.
So as the car goes on, it won't be quite clear if it's worth it.
Soon and well, these negotiations will not be against the sports spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that will allow maximum benefits under the rules to be achieved.
In the case where we are staying here, players should not be tempted to avoid being punished (which would be a clear case of the rules), they would probably have chosen better when it was explained to him.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or avoiding punishment.
Although there is no limit between doubt and generality of the rules, I believe that in this case there was only a doubt.
I think the complaint is due to two reasons: because it involved two self-defences and the way in which the transmission of instructions to their enforcement has been carried out.
The violation of the principles of sport is not as ethical as aesthetic as it is.
War offers for dinners in Barcelona
The Dictate calendar concentrates this year on the 16th and 17th of December.
Soon there will be a harvest of hired employees who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the Turkish med or lottery, the next December comes again with a premier party, which is still running as a oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, the customer's prices are reduced: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the business and the company's questions are agreed with this sector.
In order to complete the complexity of the numbers, the calendar focused this year (when the Friday Sunday came) on the application for a week from 13 December, resulting in a daily reserve of 16 and 17 in the spring, while there was almost no operation in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the years began, there are many companies that have broken down collective parties for the reasons set out.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay a fine on parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many require prices at the limit of necessity, claims the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restoración de Barcelona, Gaieeta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities shall not be considered at this time to predict what the celebration of this month will be.
"People think it better than they do reservations."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to price, they're careful," he adds.
Trades are going well for those "who offer quality and good service at a affordable price", says and reminds that due to the crisis, customers tend to go down and most customers want to lose around 25 euros now.
The survey in the various devices shows that the largest bid for a reservation is on evening 17 December.
The Soteras Group reports a real booking boom on this Friday, with the highest requirements of up to EUR 30 due to the offer menu, whose total prices are between EUR 25 and EUR 30.
in another significant company, Andilana, which has read 16 devices in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), has brought the speciality of the annual calendar of more time reservations and it has been since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to maintain prices from last year, and our menu, from which everyone should choose, moves from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
In the group AN Group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remain optimistic after the second half of the profits increase and have relatively solid views on the holiday market.
The sources of this company emphasize that the 18th December will also be held on the day of the finality of the talks between friends.
They added to their six group menu the menu of dinner, starting at 30 euros or more, as they indicated in comparison with the summer year's trend to lose 10% more than for other items such as coffee (Spanish forest wine - see above).
They also noted that companies are already emerging that call their employees again and that the size of the group seems to be something bigger.
Vice-President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Free Time Centre in Barcelona) Henri Goma believes she's starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings "lived", even though the customers "recorded to maximum".
He didn't even get paid to pay for his work during the Christmas celebration.
Pakistan's nuclear programme has produced a great disillusionment in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States of America's enlargement in Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest, which is building a Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
According to the explanatory and significant details that offer regarding the content of the communication and the opinion of representatives of the North American diplomat in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, in terms of nuclear security, is "in the process", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The specific nature of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that its weapons are not mounted, but they are consistent in order to ease their destruction in the event of an attack - represents one of the main reasons why Washington has been defeated.
This calculates in Pakistan's Anne W. Patterson in a report before the present national security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear devices to the territory under the control of the Taliban, data dispersion of nuclear material and injury to the transport of nuclear material".
The increase in the number of persons associated with nuclear arsenals and the programme of directed shootings has not only been observed in the United States but also in Russia, as a growing and representative reason to be on guard.
"Pakistan must have hired personnel with a strong religious faith to protect nuclear devices; given the fall of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or directed shootings," said expert Jurij Korelov of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their colleagues from the United States.
The biggest news document published by Julian Assange's server is that further lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Deceptively issued by the ambassador in the flower, who qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain without response or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national media worker for South Asia, notes that "even in the face of the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world."
Peterson's great-grandfather also asks Washington that during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani, "we have explained very well" that "Pakistan army must end with silent support for terrorist groups".
She's chief Wikileaks.
Obama appoints a highly appointed employee responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new agents of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" with the aim of investigating and determining where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange create a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced "external challenge", i.e. a series of notes, to "localization and monitoring of movement" Assange.
However, it is not a classic order for detention.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates to November 20.
And there is nothing to do with the last one more than four million diplomatic documents, even with accusations of sexual abuse that Australia is facing in Sweden.
According to this, the legal representative of Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures us that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was November 20th when the International Police Council, sitting in the French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, did not disclose it until yesterday when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for identification or location of Assango "in order to reduce temporary contact and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order detention of persons affected by the Red Cross, many Member States, as the organisations have explained, consider such a number of notices as to allow the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by a national police component - especially in cases where States have a mutual agreement on the issue of detainees, such as Sweden and England, where they would obviously have to find Assange.
This step angered Asbeg's lawyers who had published a written statement yesterday that nine-year-old Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities using videoconferencing.
They also recall that Asggen also requested and subsequently granted permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutors of his case, which compares with the legendary Lavlovic Berío, chief of Stalin's security.
"This is a hom, not a legal trace," he writes.
While the whole world is looking for - and from Australia his mother bears the guilt of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but German.
On Monday, he provided Skype from an unknown place of interview to the chief editor of Time magazine - in this interview he asked the Foreign Minister for Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for the US diplomats' order to conduct spies in the UN and violate the international agreements signed by the United States, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the press spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified for the requirement of dementia as "a funny and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should be interested in the opinion of the person who runs the website," he declared for CNN.
Obama himself believed a highly appointed employee responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella Traverse, in order to prevent other perpetrators of the document.
The intention of speaking President Barack Obama to stop adding Assange to the importance is contrasting with the views that promote conservative policies and commentators in these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be the chairman of the National Security Committee in the Lower Room, asked the Foreign Ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among the terrorist organization, "to be able to intervene and attract anyone who would financially assist them or otherwise provide assistance".
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who announced that Assange should be "killed", had to be dismissed.
"Both of them should write a fee or use a pilot-free plane or something."
Someone who didn't talk was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former Governor Arkansas and a potential candidate for president.
"Whoever will be in the government, the one who is responsible for the information unit, has given up his revenge and any other punishment than the correction would be too peaceful," declared at Fox Station
Puigcercós is looking in the ERC's calm "floating" on Carod's company.
The Republican leader will be able to make a secret vote on his resignation.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe to fight a few internal revolutions in the ERC series (Levico Republican side of Catalan - no more so), resulting in the loss of 11 Members and half votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding his resignation seems insufficient to former leader Josep Lluíse Caroda-Roviry, and also knows that the impact of this sector is already as weak as its own leadership, and that he cannot make the same age as he had other missing experiences.
So Levice's leader will try to get new criticisms through marketing, which will help him turn to popular elections.
Firstly, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to express their views in secret.
I'll never raise my hands.
If Carodians want to vote before the President, they will be able to do so without fear of the defence measures.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid slander and discrimination against his own people.
In several conversations, he claimed that he would not be considered a certified half-vote and one-on-one, but added, without making it clear that there would also be no good result "by bulharsque".
The Carodians ask for more than to give their functions to the president - which they consider to be a gesture that has no bearing, since Puigcercós is the greatest authority at the sessions.
But given that they don't have enough to do the decommissioning, they'll try to remember an executive plan from now on to May.
They are therefore expected to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document, which may lead to the vote of the National Council on 18 days a month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move the convention already under 2011.
The ERC leader declared that "multilinguality" would damage stability, and that his aim was to once and for all to be able to carry his spinal cord behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a characteristic article that current consultant Joseph Huguet has signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós's ideology, this innovation counselor took the initiative to confirm that the leader will be "changed for several purposes".
And he named them five out of which they are two.
The first is the "recomposition" of executives in order to represent at least 90% of the members, which means also new forms that are from the Carod's forced sector.
A second goal can be a big news item.
Huguet proposes that the ERC be fully completed by meeting as a functioning mechanism.
And he is thus fighting for the reform of the state so that Congress can be concluded through the delegates elected by the vote.
The conclusion of the model of the meeting system, an exception to the Spanish political party system, is the aim of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction for the last two sessions.
However, the 2008 Green Summit decided that the meeting should be assessed at the Special Congress on State Reform.
This concern is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has been reflected in the resolution of this matter.
Now, without reading critical sectors, it may be appropriate to re-examine this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILLENIO, Mexico reported a decrease of 4 cases compared with 2010.
During November 23 persons were killed in Mexico, less than four times the previous month, as reported by MILLENIO.

In the last month they're reading in Mexico 390 murders, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases are found dead in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the Toluca period.
The victim suffered at least three shots, a further wound from mercy to his head and had arms and legs tied to his neck.
The next day a body was found in the kitchen, which was located in the parking space of vehicles over the Mixtecas street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, during Naucalpan.
Early on Thursday, 4 November, at least three fatal shots of torture were found by members of the community in the vicinity of the village of Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the summer of Villa Guerrero.
According to the body, a report was found that was probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcóyotl, an 18-year-old man was shot eight times after he left his house and wanted to start collecting wastes.
On the seventh November, two victims were shot at their heads at 30 years of age in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec period.
In Chalco there was a dead man shot at the head on a long road in the El Naranjo colony, and under the body there was a calibre knife.

In Ixtpaluca there was a woman without a sign of life with two arms in her pocket.
The tattoo of Santa Muerte’s sacred status was shown on the woman’s skin (the title “Holy Death” – see also for the healers with her own image.
At the end of the month, in the village of Zinacantepec there was a dead man with at least three shots and a reported criminal group.
Two days later, two men were found who had their head covered with sand, and there was also a report in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably one of the criminal organizations in which it was said, "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
In Ecatepec there were two bodies that sent signs of torture and had linked contituencies, within a taxi left behind by the Center for Justice in the San Augustine colony.
The last day of the month, two men were found in the Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of these was walled and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was trapped in black plastic bags bound by sand and left a message; while the second was buried and found in the plastic pool in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
They found the agents with him, and the letter was sent.
China pursues its goal to reduce gravitational fluids
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 made sure that its country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and stressed that it is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will achieve its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that its country had developed unwarranted efforts to reduce the carbon level and transform its industry.
He said his country had already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases over the last four years.
However, it has been made clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He pointed out that the Chinese strategy in the climate change concerned is divided into the following four posts: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all of these points, progress has already been made, including the adoption of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
He further stressed that in China the federal authorities worked in coordination with the provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy support, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
As he said, various plans have been in progress or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, one said that the Programme for the Effective Use of Energy, which has been implemented over the last five years and which has received investment from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change, further the project of exchange of savings for fuel and the project for reconciliation and adaptation, has been clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser for climate change, made sure that China's efforts were greater than the general thought.
For example, the emissions of greenhouse gases on one citizen represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts, for example, to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects further progress by 2020.
Exemption from Spain: César Nava
The President of the National PAN (Partido Akción National, Czech National Acting Party - see also) stated that the former President of the Party was entitled to request his rights to the National Order Commission.
The President of the National Party of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espiny Barrentos was legal and that the former President of the Party was entitled to refer to the National Organ Commission and to request his right.
In his speech, which was finalized before the statement was made by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the expulsion of Espina is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"It's an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonor."
"Mr. Espino shall have the right to address in his case by means of a disease to the Commission of the National Council in order to agree on a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is no time to think about 2012 and that she was never at the chairperson's meeting table on the Alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections of the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be chosen, strengthened.
"This alliance in 2012 is the theme that has never been at the assembly table, at least not in the past, was a goal for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The PAN president said that his side stands for 71 years of dialogue, and therefore "we do not suffer internal competition, but we are tired of it and strengthen us," he added.
He said that the committee would be able to choose the best president or the president to whom the PAN deserves for the next three years without debate, so he would hand over the staff to whom the committee appoints.
"I am therefore absolutely calm and free, any of these five are to be handed over to the Bureau of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the rise that the party had recorded in recent July elections would be reflected in future complaints, although "there is not yet time to think about 2012".
"There is no need for Governor Gabina Cué to carry out this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, with roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the train and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "there are a lot of expectations and complaints in them, and I am sure that Gabino is satisfied with this expectation".
When we asked her about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, para.) for his four years in government, César Nava invited the members of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former presidents Ernesta Zedilla and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that Zedilla and Salinase governments were better than Foxe and Claderón, then they should begin to challenge them to get out of their streets," he testified.
He stated that the head of the Federal Executive Force has the right to express himself as he did during the event in the National Auditorium, since there is no theft or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes on Twitter the law to support students without evidence
"If you think the adoption of the Dream Act is right, tell your senators and urge them to accept this law," the American president of a popular social network tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act, which should legislate students without documents.
"If you think the adoption of the Dream Act is right, tell your senators and urge them to accept this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more comprehensive document requesting the public to contact the senators without delay, as the voting on this law is approaching.
"Because it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be taken," she says.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless an extension of the Bush tax reduction and government funding has been approved.
Such a blockade, which was notified by the letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect voting on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons called START.
When it was asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the president expressed his belief that as soon as the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the matter of taxation before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach agreements on this matter at some point and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of Senator Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request "voting for the closure of the debate" concerning the Dream Act law, so that the proposal for the legalization of students without evidence could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is likely next week.
The Senate's approval of Dream Act or the law of the "American dream" would legalize the mass of 800 thousand young people who had arrived in the United States 16 years ago, lived in the country for the last five years and were admitted to higher education or military institutions.
However, supporters need 60 votes in favour, because they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of its competitors make intensive attacks to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats whose most Dream Act supports have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of India, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans to decide to reject the proposal by other Democrats.
Among the Republican senators with whom the most closely aligned, the senators from Maine Olympic Snowe and Susan Colins are the senator from Florida George Lemieux, who complemented Senator Mela Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who in the past supported Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchson from Texas, but they have announced that she will no longer support it.
Another republican, who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet appeared.
Although the Snowy Representatives are invited to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the biggest obstacle in the Senate.
with literature insert the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "insert the finger into the wound" is the period of the Czech "order the finger on the head - see above.)
The second cycle of language pleasure was a walk where participants presented the literary gala presentation
"That's why I understand sex in the language, but... Right to the wound? What's waiting for me?", wrote writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to begin the second cycle of fun with language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and her question was used on this occasion as a subtitles (in another gallery, the theme of sex in the language was explained).
The finger to the wound "we bring to the stakes", brought a beloved Argentine writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who came to the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate in the golden table, moderated Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramíreze, Mayry Monterè and Louise Garcíi Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she gave to Gonzal Celorio, and which Schultz noted for a great deal, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist who, when looking for knowledge, comes from a doctor who does not respond to the same experience.
From the infector comes a confirmation: "The patience isn't my strong side, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, he explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalytic that reveals the secret: "the wound represents a truly detached wound and therefore the symbolic tooth."
The protagonist slowly woke up and concluded that "on the morning she was able to learn so much that she was really confused and that it does not exist", but she gained the conviction that joy and language dramas must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel's game with both of them.
Nicaragujec Sergio Ramírez also appeared with a lovely report, which called Chwala Invesce, in which the finger is not named in the morning, but one moment it appears.
with the essence of magic realism, the famous wizard who played the dark brought back the people who went away or repaired the honour that one woman lost, the story that then turned to speak to America, the great novel, in which his own chronicler who had delivered it had been quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the transfer when he told the recipient's capitals.
"Cervantes, who found us all, laughed at the fictional testimony that was presented in the past as real, but in another way never managed to tell the story of America with such formality that she even studied."
However, he stressed, "these are crazy and liars who have bigger fantasies" and just where the reality comes from and lies where they don't know what the story belongs to one group and what the other has reached the fictional literature of their top.
It's called the "servant tradition" effect.
"We've got what we have through his resignation."
Mayra Monter next highlighted and commended the broadness of the interpretation, which enabled the invitation of the International Bookshop to make his speech fingertips.
The Cuban-Portorian writer showed his finger on the big wound of social violence that passes through her country - and divides it from Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, and good song are closing a quiet compromise which is of course not imagined," she said, after which she pointed out that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the compromise created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
Last night, Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose appearance also contributed to the "to this finger to the wound of the writer who was charged with writing".
He said that in a world that is fast living, and also in intellectual habits and control of knowledge that transcends dogmatism, it is forgotten that "the small is hidden from every attack and every turn is also small."
"To be masters of our ideas and realities we must color: and to paint a significant number of times to put a finger into the wound and burden those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in characters, black, in complicated ideas and without coloring, and also to burden authorities who prefer this black world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three cuts in the final, during the career he had lived good and bad, but he was already able to reach three opportunities in the ruling series.
in Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, with two different styles marking with their techniques, teams that have a sharp difference between themselves in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three cuts in the final, during the career he had lived good and bad, but he was able to reach it on three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he has gone through with an inexhaustible, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
Argentinic had to calm down with a silver medal, remained a victory step and played with the same team following the finals.
The Santistic strategy as a trainer came to his first final in the tournament of Apertura 2002, when he was in charge of the Morelia Club, with which he held a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then in the course of Clausura 2003 he re-entered the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
With the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Tourneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "pangs" from Toluky, Rubén once again suffered defeat, even though his team was playing against the "Uzenars" (see also Deportivo Toluca) after 210 minutes of games not more than 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he won three times and had two opportunities to record the title, but finally his three players passed from 11 steps and the team had to wait for 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against "Red Devils" from Toluky and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and escape the curse, and he could first celebrate the title, even though he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to lie to statistics, this is for the club, for the party I'm bound to, and the title would certainly be for me, but it's the first thing that matters," said the coach when he was told about the number that speaks in the final against him.
in the live memory, the previous finals, in which he confirmed, learned a lot, "when we brought up the lesson that until the decision is final, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, just like players, because we've already been ready to celebrate with two penances, and I think we've learned in this, until the game is over, we can't celebrate".
She doesn't worry that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, she says to her players: "You never try to get to a series of criminal fights, you try to end up in normal times, but there's never another chance, and it's supposed to be prepared, we've been prepared in the past tournaments, but we've been disappointed, but the judge has come up with bad things, perhaps because of the nerves or the pain we felt when it was titled in our hands, but we've lost it, we've left it in our way, and we hope this time we're not going to do anything like that."
Romano has the chance to stop being the second and taste the first praise they bring.
United States of America changes the rules for visa sharing
People will need to turn to the Service Centre for visa applicants even before they speak at the Consular Division; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa processing process will be changed to the United States of America and the consulate.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to turn to the Centre for visa applicants (abbreviated from the ASC) even before the consultation at the Consular Division.
A staff member from the ASC will collect biometric information from the applicant and they will be assessed by the Consular Division prior to the conversation.
The new procedure will have certain benefits, including the following:
The total costs for the visa facility will be lower and no fee will have to be paid for the agreement of the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and the second for the delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee that covers all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, 150 for a visa application (including a temporary worker visa) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to resume their visas will not have to conclude a conversation with the consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and receive fingerprints.
In view of the fact that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Division meeting will spend less time than in the past.
Similarly, those who will request a visa at the consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay extra fee for 26 dollars.

NASA announces the discovery of foreign life
The U.S. space agency agreed to a tomorrow press conference to present evidence that could cause harm in the pursuit of foreign life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will notify tomorrow, Thursday, of an astrobiological phenomenon that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The exhibition will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock of experts on astronomy, science based on study of origin, evolution, expansion and the future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalist, NASA assured her that she would present a "problem that would cause harm in the pursuit of foreign life", which raised speculation among experts from other countries.
The revelation could confirm that there are other creatures besides us and other creatures living in non-hostile conditions that were considered to be non-citizens, and who could imagine that one of them would become intelligent creatures like humans, if the better conditions in which they live.
It appears that one of the microbes found on the island of Mono in the Yosemitic National Park in California, where it lives in the environment, is considered too cheap for any form of life, since the lake is rich in art.
The creation of arsen in some way uses his life, and that is his ability to raise the possibility that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere on earth.
Astrobiologists say, if these organisms use arsenic metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another form of life different from what we know."
The space agency will notify the actual arrival of the announcements at the next press conference.
The conference is the participating geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Patron produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitution of the Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism".
The 60th parliamentary period was not even started when the opposition block of the PRD (Partido de la Revolutiona Democrata, Czech "Democratic Revolution" - exc.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana work" - Precise), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda") and Jesúseus Manuel Patrón Montalvem, who had been declared independent, discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the Snow.
Prior to the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PPD and Patrón Montalvo "stirred" against the reform of the Constitution as it states.
This reform, repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two persons from the same number of sides who will rule Congress.
These four delegations, together with Gloria Margarito Santos's coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López British by PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally create political marginalism by the party PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and the PAN.
He stressed that during the next few days they would talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will be re-examined by these two sides, which ended the opposition coalition.
"When I came here, I'm looking at it because we're out of any decision, even they don't even want to consider the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez from Convergencia indicated that the PRD, PT and Patron agree and will therefore create a pluralist group.
It can't be allowed, he continued that after what was monopolial, Congress was now "double".
The hope of reform is not that there will be endless bipartism in Congress.
This group begins with five lawyers and its members now talk with other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez gave.
Ezequiel Reynos Sparza from PT explained that Congress has now become two "uses" - in the assault on PAN and PRI.
"It was once ruled by only one side, and today it is divided by two."
Mr. Montalvo asked to respect the delegation's personality so that he could be given a place at the same table.
"To make us five Members who are likely to be nine, but right now see us in five, we are not left behind because of the broken agreements outside, each in another group, we have met to find a place at the same table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have created and agreed to, we are standing outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
It looks like another 200 thousand pesos for "supplier"
The workshop in Mazatlán will pay for another check by the owner of the company supplying electricity.
Another check on something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the workshop by Lorení Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
The amount paid in this second half of this year by the owner of the company supplying electricity shall amount to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page transparency of the workshop, this last check of number 9258447 was issued on 16 November of this year, a total of 200,144,56 pesos was displayed and as its subject, "equation of unpaid payments".
Co-founder Luis Miguel López Moreno pointed out that the village would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Russian State Audit Office for sales at high prices, another volume.
What has not been said is the total amount that still owes her to work, and how many checks will still be sent in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought now, it's only paying for what we owe it, just like other suppliers," he said in one conversation.
The last check was "reopened" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although the company has not yet been published in the Government's list of legal provisions in the case of a company audited by the Russian State Audit Office in order to limit the use of their services by other administrative authorities, the contractor has made sure that the service of the consultant has not been used again.
In the previous period, after 25 July, journalist Noroeste published a review of the checks by his consultants, who claimed that during the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the third period of the age of George Abele Lópeze Sáncheze, the city of Camachové Palazuelos has paid more than 10 million pesos by means of 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it placed checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining about the lack of foreign tourists because of the poor status of Sánchez Tabuady in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the deep-sea of Sancheze Tabuady, the tourism sector in Mazatlán is asked to pay attention to the areas and places that are in bad shape, and not to show such a presence in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders in the area of Zone Dorada, recalled that they repeatedly requested to return to the destination, and what the tourists here find is to be replaced with new activities or trails.
He pointed out that the bad attitude of the street and of the travelers is affecting tourists who are passing through here and seeing the mess that has a negative impact on close business.
"Politicals don't know what it is to shut down a business one day and have no idea of the markets that they avoid, otherwise they wouldn't be able to solve these concerns so long and without proper planning."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist pool had caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the workshop.
"The Council will have to assume responsibility and to refrain from repeating such a thing, it will have to take preventive action, not only to correct existing commitments," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, since not only because we are a tourist area, but also because as citizens, we deserve a clean living place, workers should change their strategy for city maintenance."
There are other places that seem strange and fascinating, such as the Mazatläm and El Venadito (monment, socha jelena - see above).
"In today's time to receive tourists, regardless of propaganda alone, a good product must be offered, and thus a city that reflects the purity of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There has been no need for attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well-known, maintenance is missing.
Speaking about a number of places to be arranged in cooperation with the workshop, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a tourist promoter, said that the preservation of tourist facilities in Mazatlán is not costly, since they are not used properly and do not have a good idea.
Mazatlán's success offers many historical and cultural goals and areas, however, which will need to be arranged first so that we can attract these places and bring them to the list we have for the promotion of this destination."
IP requests for results by Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to assume a great responsibility for their taking the lead in the pursuit of better Sinaloy in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period is full of decent work and without agreement between the parties and the State enforcement forces the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is in crisis and faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Party of Nueva Alliance, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence and the last from the PVEM, which includes 40 national representatives.
The list of new members of the Congress is expected to be able to implement sound guidance, commitments to companies and different areas requiring responsible legislative work, and will not be repeated by the same party and patriarchal patrons.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Council for Business (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of the Congress be given great responsibility and have, for example, been on the road for the better of Sinaloa in various challenges ahead.
"We expect that the Members will actually exercise their right, without agreement between the parties, because they are usually taking measures to promote their own interests and become leaders of the governing bodies and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary crossings that would lead to a ruling before the order.
"We want them to carry on decent work and to be committed primarily to companies and sectors, because they were the Sinaloy people who gave them their voice in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, stated that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to collect all the efforts to achieve economic growth in the country, as the current economic situation is very complex.
Most importantly, to promote economic growth in order to create investment and infrastructure tenders, which support a certain way of creating jobs."
As regards travel, he requested that new lawmakers give him more weight in the framework of the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that this is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is not targeted because it is an important economic activity, bringing money and investment, which is also directly opposed to agriculture."
In addition, in order to provide funds for starting tourism projects, Congress should help to add to the state's security and help with the alcohol law that failed to resolve in the previous parliamentary periods.
Three Kings Searched for
Pancakes, car and driving cars are together with other players on the list of children's invitations to the Coronad Valenzuel family.
For their parents, it will be difficult to fulfill their three kings’s wedding vows, since their home is read directly by 12 people and one baron.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will make toys and clothes that they like so much.
The family lives in a humble shelter in the city of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because the husband doesn't have any luck, but we're selling Mandarins and Bramboss... and I'm going out on the street on Sundays to sell to the street," said Cayetsan Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaida is ahead of her wife or bike, while her third sister, Isabel, would like Miss Barbie.
As for 10-year-old José Alfred, he'd like a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayeta would like to dress in a size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see the son' because it was very expensive'," recalls Cayeta.
For older children who were right at school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a 12-year-old Isaiah size 10, which eight-year-old Miguel has a size 8.
The fourteenth-year-old José Juan's lack of tennis, so he's going to have a couple of sizes five and a half or six.
If you want to help fill the dreams of children from the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Look at Three Kings", and bring gifts or money in cash at the reception of the Noroest dinar.
14 drug dealers who were arrested
The 10th survey was carried out in Estonia, in the middle, in the context of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of the Indian knop.
Forty people were arrested and facing various charges.
The visits took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places that served to produce drugs.
"About 750 pieces of Indian knob, four kilograms of hash, the money and equipment that was used for the production were fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a speaking police officer in Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of which were thought to be the head of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
Prisoners had to be brought to the justice court in Sherbrook next after their arrest.
They could be accused of the production of an Indian knop, his detention with the purpose of trading with him, extortion and theft, among others.
These studies followed a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access this arrest," said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers investigating the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and Sherbrook Memphrémagog Police Department.
Illicit migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the law of conservatives who, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal passengers will be clearly overcome, while all three opposition parties in the centre declared that they could not support it.
"A significant measure I'm dealing with about Chartu."
"I stand right on the side of the side that was building grief under your feet," said the head of liberal Michael Ignatieff, an enveloped delegation after a week's meeting du caucus.
Liberians insist that the proposal of the law, as proposed, is a law that would allow for the retention of up to one year of any person coming from the ship, identified as a ship carrying an illegal passenger, to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
Chief of Quebec's Block, Gilles Duceppe, also pointed out that he could not support the legislative proposal because he is leading to a wrong objective.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD critic in the question of immigration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms that want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigration.
"The non-democratic agree to take action against the carriers of illegal migrants, and that is what we consider to be a significant part of the other proposal, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the proposal of the law of conservatives, because it takes guilt on the hostages and places children in prison for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenny accused opposition parties.
"Canadians together communicate to the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada to a man and deal with it as a pathologist."
They expect Canada to take further action, Minister Kenny responded.
The government has not declared a vote on its proposal of law, which could lead the country to withdraw it.
One conservative then told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote in order that every messenger who is opposed would respond to his presence before his voters.
New Unit Meaningless Unity
Despite the announcement that the possible establishment of a permanent unit for combating corruption and corruption, many observers continue to require the creation of a public investigation commission for this problem.
Minister for Public Security Robert Dutil insists that this opinion does not fall into the picture: Québec agreed with the Department of Investigation in New York to examine this issue in January of the following year.
Metropole has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why yesterday's announcement didn't surprise one of us.
It should be noted that during the meeting of the Standing Council on Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not implemented even though Robert Dutil was present.
It was no longer necessary for public security criticism, PQ Stéphane Bergeron's website to assess this announcement as "the queen of the skull" and "amateur solution to the knee".
Minister Dutil himself answered those who fear that political power has too much impact on the potential future of the unit.
"They'll be at peace with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we know it."
"We know this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejeana Parenta, there is nothing to replace the hearing of witnesses in public proceedings.
"In addition, Mr Charest is determined not to create this investigative commission, and people think, like you and I, it's hiding something," he explains.
"The only means of achieving the establishment of the commission of inquiry is Jeana Charesta's demissione," explains Yves Boistert, professor of ethics and politics at the Institute for the Education of High State Officials.
In order to be able to get out of this dark street, Quebek proposed that he give special strength to the general inspector so that he could investigate colleges and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
It also has the possibility that Quebec could give inspectors the same powers as Commissioners that allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the letters of the Charesto government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Third Law so that it would be better suited for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would stem from the strength of the operation of Marteau (Cladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the jurisdiction in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in court, Rob Nicholson, is right about some of the amendments related to this letter.
In the Jaro 2001 operation, which was carried out by the Bikers Group, although the Third Law was not yet amended, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa then allowed changes to the Gangsters Act.
Say it under close scrutiny.
A number of water flows have been under strict control due to strong conflicts that fell from Tuesday in several regions of the province.
In the middle of the afternoon in Shawinigan in Mauritius, we arrived at the bottom of the ground.
Two houses were safely evacuated.
Last night, we arrived at another basement in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road's gone.
Between noon and midnight, a number of regions were hit by a violent storm, which increased from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 other millimetres were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
In the north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were the most affected.
It could be 100 millimetres down there.
If we cut these matches with the snow collected in some sectors, we can be afraid of water currents.
Quebek's rescue service announced a warning on Wednesday night before the danger of the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The words in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in Les Laurentides, and in the Czech Republic, in the Lotbinière, have become the subject of preliminary and unambiguous controls.
In the area of de Lanaudière, there was a strong conflict between the development of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcellin-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the result of the heavy rains was a prospector bridge.
Two residences had to be safely evacuated.
In Otaouais, the landing of some lakes from the shores led to the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is prepared and is taking into account the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Water Prediction Centre issued a mid-warning alert for several rivers, in particular Maskinonge, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupent partially blammed
Quebec's advertising moderator Stéphane Dupont endured a series of attacks before the Canadian Council for the standards of radio and television broadcasting (RRTV) because of the controversial effects of social assistance and the Haitians and also because of the grave disclosure during the transmission.
The Board of Appeals and Television considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98.1 FM should have the right to express their views, but some of the reasons contained "explaining information on social assistance and inappropriate negative treatment of the Haitians is a grave statement which does not correspond to the transmission sent during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for the vote.
The Radio and Television Council received several comments on the comments made during the submissions sent between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the difficulty of the Community front of the Social Support Fund of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the consignment were inaccurate.
Modifiers must provide reliable information, not stupid.
As for suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of jealousy.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission is of the opinion that the controversial episodes of the "Dupont's messages" have resulted in a delicate theme that is impartial and appropriate."
There was no escape against him.
The last dispute was about a statement that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort became a media shot that caused a lot of reactions.
The Moderator CHOI declared that he did not send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that the necessary money will actually be provided.
The Commission is of the opinion that these comments were not incorrect, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriate negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened my class money on that thing."
"My record is empty for one and a half years," declared the moderator.
In all decisions the Commission shall refuse to use in sending a serious complaint.
In any event, the voice transmission of CHOI-FM worked "on the basis of its responsibilities".
For stations that will have to notify the decision once during the main transmission within three days, the results are minimal.
King of the Montréal Queen.
The citizen of Montreal, from Algeria, Nacerddine Earth, has an extremely special time.
The athlete, who works in "sande" (ung-fu "full contact"), joins in kickboxu and Thai boxing on dads and rings all over the world and looks for new challenges.
"I started with war artists such as kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained the Earth, which has lived in the main city since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for sports so little everywhere, because for those who don't like playing in the country that appears in combat sports, competition in North America is rare."
Recently, this man who works as a protector and assistant to UPS just added to his rival bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the category kickboxu full of contact and Thai box, said."
"I am currently preparing to China for the World War in the dream show."
"There were called opponents who ended the first four at the last master of the world in every category."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won a bronze."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eight."
"In 2007 in China, I ended up in the tournament on Friday, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished my third, added."
"It's interesting that in every competition I made some progress."
"I'll be the first year or the last one at this time!"
"san show" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China, where there are branches of wood and foot, as well as the landing on the ground, allowed.
The games are traditionally played on the floor and are more common in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of war, is the American Vietnamese source of Cung Le, well-known in the world of war art.
Whatever Nacer Earth has to keep in his career only one result, he will confirm his participation in the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic guy."
"It's so little equivalent to the Stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
The earth won its first game, in semi-finals, its category (80 kg), before it suffered loss in the final.
"The thing that hurt me was a real trial, analysis."
"There are four competing categories (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"Victory semi-finals run into their finals."
"Then every category of winners will be run so that the only champion, the king of kung-fu, can be crowned."
450 million spoken without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed after mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering to the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this valley more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which obtained the most significant contract, to manage the whole project at a total of $295 million without public competition.
This Consortium, called Energie gerance, was completed in 2004 in conjunction with the choosing of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this significant hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energy Management" Consortium obtained a lucrative contract without any public competition statement.
For Quebec's side, the complexity of the business consortium before us poses a serious problem of ethical character, which risks the elimination of competition and leads to price increases.
"It's a new way to realize colleges and distort competition."
"This means that people, no longer doing security agreements, are doing them openly today," said PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
About something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to bring how public interest can be sold like this.
Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, tomorrow's idea was different, claiming it would go to this college contract.
"I have my own way," she smiled and said that PQ was "inaccurate" and "scattered accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" to apologize to PQ.
The recipe for the creation of the Consortium is a common practice all over the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or several companies to collect their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the challenge of offering a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very compatible with the complexity of the work.
The status is already running and must be broken down by 2012.
However, the contract was recognised without competition being possible; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to recognise that the formula of the Consortium is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor even in relatively simple projects.
As last week left Le Devor, the form of the Consortium in the field of advice in engineering is the subject of a government investigation.
If we cross the Quebec companies' business registers quickly, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, while some seem to have been created.
This company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; we call CIMA+, Genival, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and their tens, leads to one legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the Energie Management Consortium, the Minister of Normandeau stressed the fact that "the land of La Baie James is typical of special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main project patron of Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Society Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will lead us to conclude the fact that the project management agreement was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to public competition and if there are few participants in the competition offering, your prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that is, you gather people who figure out the ban as participants in competition, and that you say, "Let's make an agreement at peace and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the important thing is not price, but people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energie Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000, which was received by the Queen's Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification of Le Devor, he calculated 109 contracts for engineering advice concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out samples of soil.
SNC-Lavalin stole 22 contracts, from which Genival received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having to participate in "Energy Management".
All contracts were closed.
The total is $449,783,344, including the contract with Energie Management company at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that the four companies that are members of the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "very well known by the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau sent a message that PQ is also connected to companies that "finance it", before she made it clear that she was more concerned about her managerial staff.
Barometer responsible for consumption - "green" label does not build confidence
More green, but obviously sceptic.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in "non-foreign" brands and organic certification, in order to guide him in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy in the media universe, which imposes on us and gives us more responsibility to society, this media space says that there is a lack of reliable information, failure to fulfil the obligations that even qualify as a speed for its commitment, Barometer will introduce responsible consumption, which the first article sent out yesterday.
Although the consumption of the so-called responsible products increased in 2010, Quebec citizens who are trying to sell them do not believe it too much.
Two thirds of us in fact say that they don't believe in the firm's promises regarding the environment, just because the green advertising company finds a measuring instrument that was developed by the University's supervisor for the consumption of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers are concerned about the likelihood of official certifications, which are attributed to so-called fair products, but also about the likelihood of products and brands that are identified as environmentally responsible, point out Barometer.
The same way and policy debate on this topic is adopted as a series of only 14.6% of Quebec's citizens.
Information on the relevant consumption may nevertheless be a tool to stimulate this site of consumption restored at the present time by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, vacuum and incorrect nature of information would reduce over 46% of consumers.
This is the second speed he identified Barometers, at the highest price of these products.
Finally, a third of Quebecese's citizens are skeptical about the data provided on the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the mark of one or more products to respond to their beliefs.
All 61% of them prioritised the purchases in the traders from their quarter and gave priority to the purchase of food produced in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - index responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumption Québek is pleased to present itself as a king of recycling, which enhances at least the impact on the environment by taking care of the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained out of their car somewhere, says Barometer: in 2010, nearly 28% of Quebec's residents indicated that they use a common transport or recommend the use of a car to drive at least two people in the interests of nature.
It also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive study of conduct that used this call.
State loan to buy a kine complex eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we have requested for financial participation in the purchase of the kine eXcentris Company Angus et le Parallèle complex, agrees with the participation, but only to the highest level of the loan.
The developing company "Angus et le Parallèle" who made a gift of up to seven million dollars from the minister of culture for the purchase of a cinematographic complex at the center of Saint-Laurent and who proved his mission as a lover of film art, did not receive what he requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own circumstances.
More than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would have been lower, some of which would have been an initial expectation that could provide a basis for a viable solution under the favourable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million had already been abandoned by Quebec, but the applications have already been reviewed for a reduction.
The proposal and action plan were sent by the Prime Minister of St-Pierre to the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opponent came to the SODEC company on Tuesday.
Only Parallelle and Angus have time until 31 December to answer.
However, it appears that a state-wide mortgage must be rejected.
Remember that the Association of China's owners and cinematographic centres in Quebec was set up against the State's direct investment in order to support eXcentris's repurchase, assuming that the Minister of Culture should not finance the property project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
However, a number of participants in the discussion sought basic economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his kin space within ten years of film art after he funded the construction of the complex itself, which could be the reason for a change from the state's financial council.
The lack of seats for independent films is ridiculous in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to obtain a permanent client.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, conducts a campaign to release financial resources into the private sector, believing that he's paying $700,000 for the auction.
Since January 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three powers on February 27th next year and to offer the most beautiful film Xaviera Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't mention Le Devor and he ignores himself, thinking with his group of ideas about the reductions that have been made to him.
A high-ranking opposition to Canada as a whole...
The new American diplomats mentioned in the announcement by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex Canadian minority against the Americans, but by the authority they express their sense of respect for Canada's last-named allies.
America's diplomats are surprised that every Canadian volition lies at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to vote, and believes that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to adopt her budget in 2009!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, published yesterday on public opinion, provide more sensitive details to get "under the skin" together.
The communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the election campaign, shall specify in detail the extent to which the United States is not a part of the agenda discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of an American novelty in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins is offering a few explanations on this situation.
"Canadian minority complex, which is almost overwhelming, points out possible political leaders to talk about internal barriers, instead of realizing that these elections are also relevant to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he concluded, "the term of reference in these elections is, however, too dangerous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about them."
The speaker understands this "sounding silence" rather than that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the party or even better the leader of the party to conduct these important relations should be the key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another expression of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, charged with affairs in Ottawa and Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your road will help to ensure the government's maintenance when voting on trust at the beginning of the union budget, which Canada will publicly recognise its first deficit for more than ten years, for the plan to recover from $30 to $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention of the government's having to cancel the pre-session meeting in order not to be defeated by coalitions and that opposition parties are undermining their survival of the proposed plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Wilkins, warns Washington on what continues to be a more negative picture that hits the dramatic series sent to CBC in the United States.
The Velvyslanek is concerned about the dispatch of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there can be little doubt about the references to the Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also on charges for violent CIA exposure.
Another report refers to the fact that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was prepared to accept some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the principle of "the case."
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he passed some paper on Omar Khadr, 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin, state secretary."
"The secret has come to the conclusion that the case is reversing."
Finally, let's say that those who belong to WikiLeaks are coming.
Tom Flanagan, former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, announced at CBC's doors that the person responsible for this mass destruction should be "destroyed".
It was reported and told about it and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The World Plan for the Reinforcement of Light
In Cancún yesterday, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES) corresponding to almost one third of the other restrictions that should be aimed at stabilising the planet’s climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the process of major concrete projects that the UN wants to spend in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult commitments to reduce industrially successful countries.
According to yesterday's proposed plan, if the untapped fuels that monopolize more 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace the flu-compact or, even better, the lamps with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the basic amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet would be exhausted due to light.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% emissions from the car park all over the world.
In the last year of Kodana, a large country with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and, among others, Canada, committed to voluntary plans to reduce GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be calculated from this balance of 5 Gt to achieve climate warming stability by 2020 at 2 degrees Celsius so that it can be excluded from control.
95% of the energy is diluted in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5% is the product of light.
The energy consumption is reduced by 75% with flu-compact lamps and with new DEL lamps, we reduce this consumption twice more.
The flu-compact lamps will last from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
New brands with DEL, such as Philips' production this week - this company has definitely participated in the study of the UN - have a projected life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the scattered brand, which gives us a picture of possible contradictions with the reward plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new candles can also function with restats and produce less heat.
And they don't have any food.
A number of experts have expressed the benefits of flukomactating lamps because they contain mercury and should be classified as a dangerous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, although the producers would have gathered.
However, as the report suggests, the main source of the greenhouse gas emissions on the planet is not a flu-compressant lamp, but rather a heat-ignition electric lamp that releases much of the moisture needed for the production of electricity consumed in the sprayed ovens.
Only in the United States, these centres make up 25,000 tons of wheat a year.
The report also provides detailed results from this international programme for each country.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat electricity, whose building would be 2.5 billion.
The elephant coast is impatiently expecting the results of voluntary results.
The General Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate disclosure of the results of the presidential elections in the Slovene Coast after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent voluntary commission to complete its work and to make the preliminary results known without delay, to highlight the language president of the UN."
"All parties in the Slovenes and Institutions Borders are asked to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to maintain any initiative until the notification of provisional results."
Even through pressure from some foreign governments, the voluntary commission allowed the highest date - Wednesday - without publishing results, three days after Sunday's closing.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the term of office of President CEI on television confirmed that the Commission "continues to work", so as to be able to report the results.
In the middle of the world , there have been numerous calls for the CEI to finally announce the name of the victory of the second car between the dissident Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattar.
However, the Gbagbo Group is dependent on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for a "prominent" vote in the north, which will address the former rebels of the New Army (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Slovenia Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of alarming voters who practiced the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have made the allies of the President of the Slovene Coast from wanting to fly.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the problem that Gbagbo gave.
President Gbagbo's opposition is that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political link of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattar, a man from the north who demented any connection with the former rebels, condemned the detention in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His associates confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that giving the Constitutional Council trouble after he prevented the voluntary commissions from issuing the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was considered to coordinate the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two and a half years.
The United Nations warned the political party of the Sloan Coast that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round, on October 31, as a 38% win with 38% votes to 32% for Alasasan Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (ILO), remained stable by 9.3% in the metropolitan area of France (9.7%, including sea areas), as shown by the revised seasonal derogations (CVS) published on Thursday.
The number of unemployed stood at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the population active in the metropolis and 9.7%, including sea areas.
The unemployment rate shall be increased by 0,1 per year.
In a broader prison, 3.4 million people in the metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether or not they are available for two weeks to be able to work, and whether they are looking for or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has also increased with a new increase in unemployment rates reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25%, including sea areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Authority, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
In the case of seniors, they reported a moderate increase of unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 in three months, as in the year), 482,000 people over 50 years of age and 6.6%, including sea areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population reported benefits from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee no longer publishs the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after the complaint about her method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, in contrast, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% measure for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9%.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and is charged
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of the waste processing companies and a brother of the PS Governing Council of Bouches-du-Rhoone, was convicted and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into public orders, considered to have been received.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abuse of the property of the company, abuse of public funds and public property, detention, payment of taxes, receipt of charges for the influence of the authority and possession of the gun, he was charged by his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions this might ask him, and no offenses."
"It's easy to track her for a lot of criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, in front of his client's interview.
Mr Guérini pointed out by means of his lawyers that he sent a judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned in the middle of the night.
According to his lawyer, Lucian Simon, his client never did anything else than to ensure the operation of the warehouse that he had to fix.
As far as the assignment of the ban or the allocation of funds related to their operation, he had never known anything like that, Simon indicated.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of Aubagne's Aglomeration Service, was accused of abuse of public funds and complexity, and left for freedom, under the court's supervision of the prohibition of contact with the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain to him all the facts that have been raised."
"The investigating judge looks at it and lets her go," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The other four persons were accused and released on the night of Tuesday afternoon at midnight, with two of them being held in court, introduced by the representative of State Governor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of the elegant Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is urged to accept taxes for the influence of the Authority and for passive corruption."
Two agglomeration officers from Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringeier are accused, one for the "pressure and abuse of the property of the company", the other for the "competence of the use of public funds".
Finally, the trader Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "enforcement of the abuse of the property of the company".
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged with the case of the inaugural public arrests involving Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company to help pay for the vast gang.
The investigation was conducted in the framework of several open trials against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters relating to suspected fraud in the conclusion of public orders, in particular in the case of waste.
From the source of a close investigation, the monitoring focuses in particular on the conditions for the assignment and operation of the warehouse in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as some cities from the town of Marseille (MPM).
The event of Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace transferred the media to Syria
During more than ten months, from June 2009 to May 2010, Clotildy Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spiony", gathered views in France, introduced diplomacy to war preparedness and highlighted the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
It's all closely followed by diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the consequences of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, and went so far as to advise them how to manage such cases of handcuffs in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how the leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young France was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, Iran, imprisoned in France and sought American justice for underground trafficking in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they explain to the sharp light of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the release of Clotildy Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram, written on 12 August 2009, in Paris, has the title "Iran: French commentaries on how to solve the problem of handcuffs".
Advisory from the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, chaired by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American University of Allegron.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that the Americans do the same much for him to be brought back to his own national staff by violence detained in Iran.
"Be careful," they say, "always express serious" in the media the words "the fundamental human rights", "innocentness", "constitutional liberation".
It is necessary to bring into the frenzied Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they'll ask you to stop it."
Because efforts have been made to unveil through discreet channels, "just doesn't raise anything," the Iranians are "mere of escape maneuvers".
Mr Richier reminds us that the arrest of foreigners is "the Iranian family tactic: defending hands for the purpose of "political extraction".
It notes that the release of Clotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when the French Embassy will grant her the "requirement of a high amount of money to the Iranians" (crowd of EUR 230 000).
And let's say that the Elysian palace anticipates cases of handicraft, a phenomenon that "will be wiped out".
In the future, the Iranians would "be able to arrest the next 1800 French people living in Iran," he says.
of 28 August 2009
Clotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains locked in Iran.
Information spreads: Iranian Majid Kakavand, to whom the United States declares that he has been arrested for trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, has been released in Paris on the basis of a decision of the judge.
As many observers ask about this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which monitors the illegal Iranian network for the acquisition of material intended for the nuclear programme, Majid Khaqavanda is a bad report.
Did France join the contract?
Freedom of Iran for the release of young French?
In another conversation with Kathleen Allegron, September 4, François Richier is making sure it's not.
The Elysian palace, as he says, was not only "assured by this decision of the judge", but sought an opportunity to stand against it.
"The discussions took place between the Presidential Authority and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the decision of the court", she notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" control of the French intelligence service.
The Council of the Elysian Palace shall issue a telephone number, suspend the telephone audience and then inform the American diplomat that Iran is currently in Paris’s buildings controlled by the Iranian Highway."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss' imprisonment in Iran, the Elysian palace develops efforts, unites, through the community and organized "union" media to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity no matter how ironic it is and find that manipulation brings its fruit, because several articles in print reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes a media "blat" of French officials".
Such a measure of "thanks", expressed against Mr Assad, asks for a great deal of gratitude in Paris.
"And through their announcements, the French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a valid idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then provides the reasons why the Elysian palace has made payments to this firm.
Intensive communication "directs the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening with Syria", analyzes.
Policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as early and undeserved".
By "as a triumph of the Syrian role", Paris strives to "demonstrate Syria, which praisers can serve when playing constructive role in the field".
The aim is also to "sit down the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. ambassador knows this from a very good source.
11th August, François Richier said to him, "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we still thank them."
"This should at least bring confusion and misunderstanding between Iran."
Clotilda Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy takes her to the Elysian Palace.
In the communiqué, the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria thank them for their "active role in the promotion of our country's liberation".
End online here after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecivälský", which will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to it, the responsible government actors have indicated.
The legislative proposal will be submitted to Parliament in December so that the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family will be able to request the online games to be taken to this game after 16 years of age.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with school education and they are not able to lead normal lives during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a leading minister who has a proposal for an old-age law.
Online games will be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law.
The government also assumes that it requires companies to mix daily access to this game for young people whose parents ask for it to be filled with the responsible worker.
It also makes available to people who require it, free programs that allow them to limit their time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the country's most "exploited" and daily printing provides a variety of facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an unstoppable mystery in the world's competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals on World Cyber Games, and it is made up of 58 other nations.
World Heritage in the years 2018-2022: Fifa is a host country.
Full room for suspicion of corruption is set up by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday, 2018 and 2022 of the World War I hosted by the World War I, the election of highly politically motivated, where the fight against influence and lobbying threatens to advance technical criteria.
It is certain that the Fifa Royal Competition in 2018 will end in Europe, the traditional heritage of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The ministry in 2022 will be much more exotic, and the International Federation hopes it will be able to obtain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent, or continue to be established in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
A list of the personalities participating in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government agents Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) will be able to create an idea of the scale of economic and political networks throughout the world.
Consistency in the backup is at risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest it is difficult to set hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the evaluation report Fifa documentation English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee within the hour appointed for the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the investigation leading to the suspension of two EC /European Commission members?/ for corruption (Reynald Temari et Amos Adam) may have destroyed the chance of their country, the coroner's coroner, who has just hosted the world champion once a year.
The BBC set up the crown on Monday, when it issued a document which "opened to the pen" three influential EC members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa uncomfortable and bring into the new English leading factor with David Cameron in the first row.
The President of the Government hopes that he will be able to re-establish the ones that his predecessor, Tony Blair, was able to get to London for the 2012 Olympics Organisation.
Will these intensive activities be sufficient to add to England a new light on its name in the EC (European Commission?)?
Nothing is more certain, because the two Spanish-Portuguese do not miss the drums of already prepared stadiums, their well-being (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the fragile economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give this ambitious student austerity.
The appropriate remedies against the English and concerns about Spain and Portugal's payment capacity are only increasing Russia's position, which was outsided even over the months of its documentation (the stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, the President of the government, Vladimir Poutin, decided that the ministry would not move to Turkey and publicly declared "no competition in the preparation of the vote", in words only a few accusations against members of the EC (European Commission).
"We'll be watching them, we'll try to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favorite with its major experience since 1994.
The world's highest economic performance, the seat of the chief sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a great impact on Japan and South Korea, which, in part, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidates appear to be early for both countries, which jointly served as a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 world's mystery China, which has just passed the Fifa, has made Asian chance for 2022 free.
With Katarzyna, who took a big step out of hand in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion to the new countries, but these two countries represent more risk than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, would be able to pay for flat-rate TV payments (on the basis of time stamps) paid by European countries, creating a hybrid force for Fifa.
Second term: visibility (secure)
De Gaulle was really wrong.
Mitterrand woke up the thought that he was pregnant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't even notice.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysian palace allows someone else.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously not in good agreement with the Department of Secretary Affairs associated with the President's office.
So it's supposed to be like there's always going to be a mistake.
In one way or another.
In 2006, until he wanted to believe it, friends of Jacques Chiraca made orders not to be expelled from the third term.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy, with a serious expression, confirmed that "it will sometimes be decided in the fall of 2011".
As recalled before the members of the UMP parliament in the middle of the evening in the Elysian Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" is a little hot spot.
Was it an official announcement of his candidate?
He wasn't far away.
The President only recalled that the 2008 Constitution adjustment had reduced the number of five-year functional periods to two.
It was only a confession, not a notification.
It's not the first time she remembers the humorous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and a half years ahead of you," he said in June 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think of another stage."
His previous years will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate less.
If they make comments, it's because they're both true.
Fasting the way to the candidate to the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to the Ségolan Royal Collegiate, which pushes Nicholas Sarkozy to testify.
It is, however, because its candidate in 2012 is clear that many in the PS want to be organized into the fighting groups more early than thought.
Bad look on the other side.
First, the right-holders would prefer the candidate Françoise Fillon to the candidate Nicolase Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss this with UMP," responded immediately and looked at people from the nearest corner of the government.
"If he believes a possible breach, he won't apply," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, who's done with the appearance.
Euro: The European Central Bank is required to continue in its purchases of national securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Governors of the Central Year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the implementation of the crisis or, at least, the notification of a large number of unusual monetary policies to be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis in the European Union requires that the institution for the issue of securities will certainly not be able to allow to be so categorical under the threat of deterioration of the situation in the European markets with valuable paper.
The political price would be higher in this case.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Ministry of Finance Christine Lagarde gave an active role to play by the European Central Bank in the promotion of the crisis of European states' search for solutions.
She didn't mean to say if she thinks the bank could do more, for example, by raising its program to buy out the outstanding bonds.
"I express my opinion to my European partners (...)"
Yesterday, in Brussels, when the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, did not appear to be more explicit when it came to his purpose, and agreed to indicate that the purchase of national titles on the secondary market "improves" and that "we will see how we decide" during this Thursday's meeting.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will monitor its basic unchanged rate of 1%, its historical lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of a bond bond made by the European Central Bank has doubled in the last week to about EUR 1.35 billion.
And yesterday, because of the lack of understanding of contractors, new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds were made.
The euro system’s total central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There are no errors between the contracting parties in the anticipating market for further purchases (see page 29).
Even economics do not expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operation has already disappeared from the European Central Bank's arzonal for more than three months, the latter designated bank shall be able to provide unlimited liquidity under great conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that it would change in a significant way its programme."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, an economist of the Commercial Bank.
"Progressive exits reported during the first quarter of 2011 seem more likely," says Norbert Brams, an economy in Sal.
Openhouse.
"The European Central Bank should maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the early market," adds Norbert Brams.
Given the exposure of European banks to markets, the debt incurred in the euro area has no further choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary for every price to compensate for the lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the planning of the state's paychecks, which are among the most affected," said an important administrator of the obligation yesterday.
Because if the interest rates rise, the states will deal more with this in order to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It's a saved euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi is behind the back
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation got a little relieved, with the return of mandatory rates for 10 years.
Go back to temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the prime minister for the economy, the presidents said that they had heard Giulia Tremonti qualified as "unsolved" and that he expected "unpredictable" weekend, which was then demented.
In any case, in the second phase of the long German routes, the recorded 210 basic points and the price of the contract against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) were issued to 263 points, which resulted in a certain settlement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, derogations with German levels were higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself to be "very frustrated" by the "warming development of the markets" and possibly bound by the origin of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencumbered, its problem is the absence of growth and inexhaustible fiscal revenues, which goes hand in hand and poses a risk that it will not be able to meet its funding needs.
The last proclamations of Brussels were for the government of the student board.
Italy's growth is currently expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission will calculate the deficit of public finances to represent another 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the coming year (by 3.9% of the expected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (by 2.7% instead).
This report on a new set of supplements to the proposal for a national budget, which could be submitted after the holidays, up to EUR 7 billion.
"If this is necessary, new urgent measures will have to be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently supported by international institutions.
"The basic stones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we repeat them for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Governing Council under the pressure of Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, no short-term or long-term, because, through its significant debt (119.2% of the 2011 gross domestic product, NDLR), efforts to stabilize the required effort in Italy are less than efforts from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the key OECD economy.
There's a question of political instability.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will draw up a proposal to express the mistrust of the Ambassador and then organise the elections with which it is counted at the end of March.
This period would have begun, a little suitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde once again highlighted this in the Paris press conference yesterday: "I think that Europe has demonstrated this on Sundays throughout the day and night, there are obviously very solid decisions, commitment to defend its mine and its mediocre area."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion concerning the rates of the European State bonds has brought water to the millennia and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Office for Standard & Poor's notation announced that it could degradate the record of Portugal’s debt, the objectives of which are most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, especially on banking systems," says the economic exane BNP Paribas.
More than that, "political time runs shorter than market time."
Knowing this broken relationship and the dangers that are hidden, the European countries are intensifying the debate, leading to the strengthening of existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, most of the problems involved, and, in a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, is very well developed.
And with regard to the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) meetings and the Ecofin collection from the beginning of next week.
The Central Bank's meeting is taking place today.
The programme shall be based on non-conventional measures in support of the euro area country with a market focus (see above).
As regards the European Fund for Finance (ESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, advised Singapore on Tuesday after Asia, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this road to raise funds, it is prepared by the donor to achieve this objective.
The first issue of the FESF securities is expected to be issued in the next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official representative informed Reuters that the United States would support the possible increase in mobilized financial resources by additional direct engagement in the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first row, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, especially in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms linked to immediate action with rapid impact.
Lisbon and Madrid are on another route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid any price in order to apply for international assistance before applying their own budget corrections and to decide on structural reforms necessary to regain their confidence.
The capital participants in the European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the market normalisation process with the commitments made.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came to the conclusion that it would not have enough €750 billion of European and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not be able to re-enter the securities market.
Economics from the Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the first business plan with European overarching surveys, argues that the contribution of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "more favourable" form of direct financial liquidity.
The medium exists: this is the European financial stability mechanism, additional to 60 billion euros this day.
The Council, which has all the opportunity to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and hail: 24 countries have orange ready.
Snow premiums are still causing problems in the right direction, especially on the roads of other classes in Britain, and there is a risk that some economic activities will fail.
Twenty-four periods now have orange readyness due to the risk of snow and demand.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined for 20 periods which have already been declared orange ready, 18 since noon and two, La Dordogne and La Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfall causes problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and weak snow in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
These include Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, the Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow has been too large to cause problems in the right way and to destroy some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods prohibited the travel of heavy freight - over 7.5 tons of motor vehicles with the route Guangamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic on the roads of the other classes in Britain is very difficult and the police recommend driving their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school connections were banned on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening no special measures are envisaged to limit freight transport.
The periodic office "calls all drivers of cars to be the most cautious on the roads and to adapt the driving behaviour".
The General Civil Aviation Board (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel their flights to the Roissy airport on Thursday 25% and 10% to Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that traveling, operating air transport services be connected with its company.
In Great Britain, the Gatwick airport is closed in the south of London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernization of transport to Ile-de-France is in full progress, the first billionaire.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we remember 23 billion at the Grand Paris metro, which is supposed to set up the Society du Grand Paris.
In order to allow this building to be abandoned, he announced the state of supply of the grant amount of EUR 4 billion.
Simply theoretically, it is a part that enables SGP companies to use the financing part of its second source for contracts.
We're finally getting to the first supplements today.
The Rectification Act 2010 which examines the National Assembly's financial committee this morning contains the mechanisms set out to ensure these resources.
They are two: creating special tax from equipment and raising tax from office to Ile-de-France.
First, we read in the text of the proposal for a law, Article 15, "in favour of the public institution Societé du Grand Paris".
It's calculated: "The output of this rate is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the fees for the office that already exists, "to be modernized to increase the profit gained from it and to increase this increase to the Society du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
That's crazy.
It's not listed in the text.
We've got up to four billion miles away.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion from the capital allocation, which will be mobilized by the State and put into the Society du Grand Paris under the project," we can read in explanation of reasons.
This system doesn't seem shocking to us in the SGP company.
"Since we created incomes (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the study for three years and then play up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The GDP is expected to be allocated to 4 billion by 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promised billions still belong to unwelcome subscribers, is at risk of causing some kind of Russian parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Hockers and triggerers
The case of WikiLeaks has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is a public scandal, a scandal that seems to be scandalous only forms in the face of covertness that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it talks about profound changes at international level and predicts the future of the controlled recession.
But let's do the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm that each document composed of secret service (any nation) consists entirely of print cuts.
The "extraordinary discovery" of the Americans about the way of sexual life of Berlusconi is what every man has been able to read in any newspaper (all except the two Berlusconi owns), and the kadáfi's cartoon profile has been for a long time for a competitive artist for a stage.
The rule that secret documents should consist only of messages already known is essential in the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a library called esoteric literature, you will see that every piece repeats (of Graul, the Rennes-le-Château, Temples or Zednærs) exactly what has already been written in the previous sections.
And that's not just because the author of occult texts does not like looking for new information (not even knowing where to look for messages about non-existent) but because those who believe in occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
It's a success mechanism for Dan Brown.
He's also paying for secret documents.
The informer is a line, and a line (or a limited spirit) is the chief of secret services (and if not, it could be as I know, the editor in the libération News), who is convinced that only what he knows is true.
The information with a high appeal about Berluscon, which the U.S. ambassador sent to the state resort, was the one that Newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, did the discovery of these documents make so much sense?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely, that civilization, at least from the end of the second world war, and from the time that the heads of states can call or fly on a joint dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in the exhibition, have been transformed into the Spanish center.
Any weird watching film about the investigation is very well aware that it is only likely to be ignored by the media.
However, the fact that this is being repeated publicly, undermines the obligation to cover up and makes it a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most accurate information that the world's most powerful country has is a hard hit, no matter what is inevitable, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executors."
But let's get out of here for the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since then, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the distance used and so on, became a free victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now that even "the hounds" with the most recent information can't take away the scope of a hacker, it ceases to be the control message one-way and becomes a coach.
Power controls every town, but every town, or at least hacker - chosen as a mayor of the city - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you keep the power that no longer has the opportunity to keep your own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that true secrets are unfathomable (and unfavourable secrets will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is really a secretless secret because it is derived from public life; but to discover as WikiLeaks did that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were unfavourable secrets, means to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake in Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of power loss so important?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on a poster on the street corner.
But it is also very clear that modern technology is a very strong hope that they can keep up with the message on the phone.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state was traveling by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will they be able to be kept in the future in secret and sensitive messages?
I know that for the moment, the prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine the government agents who carry on discrepancies in the form of uncontrollable tracks and carry only those messages that know memory or rather hide ordinary information in the bottom of the bottle.
The information will be stored in unique copies in closed keys: the attempt to spy in the Watergate Affrey was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the chance to write that technology is moving along the front, that's the back.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Video tapes (analogous) enabled movie lovers to film a step-by-step film, take it in front and behind and discover all the installation secrets, while now CD (digital) allows only to jump by chapters, which means by macroports.
We arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way to the airport and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for policy and communication techniques to return to vehicles carried by horses.
Last note.
Jindy tried to understand what was happening in the privacy of the convent.
Now it's a big deal that's asking for reliable press information.
Climate: how France hacks its financing promises
The year following the Kodán Agreement is the time to try to keep promises on fast-blocked financing (called fast-start financing) or early, carried out by developed countries.
The great French hacky was discovered
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the successful countries committed to provide $30 billion in the years 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (it is €420 million a year).
At the beginning of COP16, the EU took a great step to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report explaining the actions of its Member States, a press conference, major side event, distribution of booklets...
A transparent operation is invaluable and assessed at its true value: the developed country and civil society would want all the developed countries and civil society to do the same with the same accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010, it has released 2.2 billion euros, leading it on the right path to comply with its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we'll find that things are much more complicated.
These financial resources are "new and additional" according to the Kodana Agreement in order to ensure that the increased burden is realized without the acquisition of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, among others and France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone picks a reference that suits him the best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 reference: international funding was maintained and it still added 150 million to it for three years as a fixed start title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment periods or with terms at the level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France believes that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in the past period or at the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au development.
In particular, France's total increase in support for developing countries can remain unchanged (or even decrease), has to fulfil its commitment to financing "new and additional" ...
Another decisive factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet, and each one chooses his own method of calculation.
Some, for example, France, believe that 1 € of the loan is equal to 1€ of the gift.
Of course, this is hard to show: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be attributed to some investments that are profitable (often related to emission reductions related to more efficient technologies) it is foolish to present one euro that we get, as equivalent to one euro we give... , we should not take it out of our commitments, but as a loan price for a credit country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only give the following justification: "keeps" its commitment to EUR 420 million, making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and 8.5% of grants (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan in such a way.
Germany has required 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovenia (between others) meet their commitments with 100% gifts.
On the other hand, when the simple majority of the European Union gives 1 € in terms of fulfilling its promise, France gives only 10 cents and considers this force to be comparable.
A beautiful cyclarian kiss!
For storage, France operates with two companies in its funding: on the one hand with the development of the stock in time and on the other hand with the real financial burden.
Although it only issues EUR 36.1 million, it can prove that it is issuing EUR 420 million "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
Manipulation Minister of Finance (because it appears that, although Berty, who made such a decision), could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to make contributions when it is only available) and when it is done, because the developing countries are not completely innovative...
The pre-financing chapter is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate debate series.
But it could be a pile of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
In any case, it is necessary to collect information from this first year of pre-financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of conducting the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and integrity and justice towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should discuss long-term funding deposits (other key chapters currently under discussion): we do not forget the question of "appropriateness" or how to calculate loans.
France should change its position to become as progressive in these investments as it is in the rest of the world.
It is hoped that everyone will join the new Ministry of the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
Amazed announcements on the fast start of France and on its vision of "appropriateness" and the use of loans could create an increase in international trust necessary to be able to continue in discussions.
A warning about pesticides that children see.
A 10-year-old child looks at one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published in this medium, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Hunting for the Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between the farmer and the grain of food commonly consumed in four foods and one easy meal as a light meal for one child in the supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five cups of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water daily - as well as sugars, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The measurement balance is striking: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are listed between carcinogens, potential or potential substances, and five of them are among clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could be treated as bad for internal exchanges (PE), according to a study of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see clearly that the reality in the consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogens, and/or PE is harmful," says the Association.
For breakfast, butter and milk contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three shown as certain carcinogens, as well as approximately twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Jablko, imported from Brazil, studied as a small pig, contains the proportions of six chemical substances, including other prohibited fungicides in France.
It also pays for green fascules in Kenya, including food, in which the study revealed the rates of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, biftocks from soft meat, tuna in the back and even in the back and back and the back were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of dust and chlorform was detected in the water from the coheuette analysis.
Steak from salmon to dinner was "better" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to burn food in the microwave troubus was not excluded.
The final risk for consumers of this "containing cocaine" is likely to be underestimated," says the study.
The Eco-European Greens Group (EE-LV) proposed "the creation of an emergency situation" to set up a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "nutrition of civilisation diseases".
In July the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the status of the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables in Europe from 76 in cereals.
