Noah helped Trabzonspor to the second place, truffled and Schkoda
Filip Novák helped the cave in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title vice-mister.
His team won 2:1 at the church of Kayserispor and held the third Besictas behind him.
Lieutenant Milan Škoda gave after a winter break from Slavia ten banks for Rizespor, which had been saved, even though he was at 1:3 on the Fenerbach hill.
Newly confirmed the excellent productivity of the 7th floor in this league year.
In 63 minutes, Kayserispor's goal was to shoot a bullet and the Czech footballist fired a sword into the network.
The house started five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor set up six minutes to shoot the winner on his side when he successfully finished four on one.
The damage during the second time of escape with Fenerbache was equal to 1:1 on the sun.
The dispute did not last long, but it did not stop him, for the results of his rivals remained three points above the composite song.
The competition ends the Sunday duel of the master's Basaksehir on the hill of Kasimpasy.
The well-kept Jesky in the woods in New York City was not actually a citizen
On the north side of the Lužic Mountains, near the New Borough of Českolopsk, in the woods that led the Croatian road, there are a number of sandy rocks hidden.
Natural and art created.
And we're going out with the human hand created.
The place is called Jesky in the desert.
In fact, there was never a deserter here, but he never lived and served as a hiding place, more precisely a hidden room, apparently on the green.
The ice is pressed from side to side in the rock alert and accessible on the sides of the shora.
Right away, but it's not practical to see it in the last minute.
It's exposed to sharp layers leading to a sort of rock gallery, from where it first enters the stairs.
Even though it seems that the chamber is very far from human sights, it could be on the top floor, where today is forest, field.
"The fact that the object has no window and even a traditional heating station, simply proves that no tourist here could ever survive winter," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Philosophy Faculty of Jan Evangelist Purkyn in Ústí nad Labem.
A simple object has only a stone hole behind it, which obviously serves as a reconnaissance.
"I see it as a room to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There's a backdrop on the walls.
The removal of the pen with the syringe was completely simple and fast.
It was enough to use the sand and sand to slow down.
According to the length of the step after the syringe, and even the method of cutting can be defined as a frame of reference period.
According to history, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
They are freely available, and according to the order in which they appear, they sometimes sleep there today.
If you're approaching the ice-cream from one of the forest roads and we'll take you under the ice-circuit and the short-drinking road, you'll probably find the bottom line too.
And the road from the forest needs you still to catch a small Havran scale.
Zokaj Minařík is after a severe fall in Germany in an artificial bed
"Filip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is set up for similar cases, and we have a family member in Hanover.
This clearly eases my situation and also takes care of the daughter of Finju," the server Jezdci.cz quoted the statement of Minarík's wife Katji.
"Everyone's doing the maximum, Philip now needs time for reconnaissance.
It doesn't make sense to give any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem with headaches and patients in an art bed knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a great warrior.
Now we all have to be patient and give him time," said the woman of the fifteen-year-old.
To the financial support of the wounded Minaříka, he called on Twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the Royal George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stackes on Saturday in Ascotto, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, who created the legend Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server, about 70 thousand euros have been selected today.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kroner).
Videomakers took photos of Sassula four balls, lost 0:2
The photobalist Sassula received four-fold sword to the opposite branch on Saturday afternoon in Neapolis, but finally they had to deal with the 0:2 strike.
Not one of their heads decided after consultation with the video about the abuse.
According to the Italian media, the record of technology is not enough, so many principles have never been passed on to one team.
"VAR was closer to Sassuolo than the railway radar and put it on as yet as no team.
New technology produces records," he wrote in a comment list Gazzetta dello Sport.
"Festival of unremarked Sassula's head.
The VAR has never been so strict on one team," added the list Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol was driving in 8 minutes on Saturday, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed that Sassolo had done the same thing.
Philip Djuricce’s head, but he was not recognized after the videotape of the obscenity.
For the same reason, they did not progressively pay for any of the principles and ways of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi.
On the other hand, the housekeepers added another head.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In Czech, they got the most in history
"The growth was as much as 30 percent increase in the number of stations on our network and the trend of more frequent offers on public stations, as well as rapid development of registration of new e-uts," said the Chief of Clean Technology ČEZ Tomáš Chmelík.
Its market share is also reported by other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, manufacturers of Tesla electric cars, but perhaps also the supermarkets of Bill and Lidl.
Operators of classic pump stations are also represented by MOL.
But there's no number yet.
"We started building our electricity network first," explained language company Jan Jusk.
However, the Danish edition exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stations operated by the Czech company.
It's because the drivers from the station were picked up at 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to a 100-mile drive of less electric motor.
If we mention a small break to 1 kWh, it takes two and a half hours of average sacrifice.
Then most of the tankers went through free tariffs.
If the motorists had already paid for the election, their typical loss would have moved around 330 kroner.
Electromobility will be removed primarily in the main city.
On Prahy's territory are all five of the most experienced ČEZ companies who represent their popularity throughout the country.
In the middle of the region, he's headed for Olomouc.
On the other hand, the least interest is in a remote station in the border, such as in Bohumín or Prachaticia, which often stay all day without use.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in Czech Republic.
Only in the first half of the year, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In the extensive Deník survey, "Cheši in motion" indicated eight percent of readers that they consider buying an electric car into the family.
Only three thirds of respondents, however, know where to find the nearest offer station around them.
Not just to keep water better.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to organizers, the government's efforts to protect and heal the Czech Republic and address the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more diverse approach.
Actions with the name of the last chapter were attended by representatives of large organisations such as Huntý Duha, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have here, for example, people who are long-standing against the expansion of the Turks down here, people who are exposed to the heavy scaffolding in the Uharish Islands are here, people who stand up against the building of pointless overhaul," said the organizers of Marika Wolfov.
It noted that the main requirements of protestors are the creation of a water conservation plan in the country, the different changes in agricultural policy and the system for supporting sustainable agriculture, and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to cover the interests of people, not the independent and destructive business," she said.
In the Malostransport, a petitioning representative of the Czech State was placed to establish a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and restoration of the Czech soil and territory.
Neighbors were equipped with transparencys with passwords such as "The End of Fishing" or "The Less Oil, More Shops".
From South Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda came from the town of Zad for the people who protested against the plans of the Chrysocopic hardship in Hodoninsk.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140 000 people," he said.
He added that the gardens represent the fifth most important source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned weight of the screech is only about 500 metres from the garden, and according to surveys it is certain that the quality of water will be threatened.
He came from the village of Valeč to Karlovarsk Vojtèch Veselý.
He warned of small farmers who are not married to profits and profits, and the citizens are being targeted at the site.
"The small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the whole population perfectly, and the plans do not make such a link to the outside and the living environment," he said.

At the end of the market they had 4.6 million.
The owner of the company is the Russian Financial Group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.

The map will also include individual measures for national health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employees.
"We want to solve this at the regional level because the situation in them is not unique," said the Members.
Water and Karolinka
When they're looking at Dr. Jonas and the millennial daughter of Caroline, they don't even have that simple.
Jonah’s love protects his father, the barren Hasterbuch, and Karolinka still has no feeling that her beloved Jonah is not a man.
Still there is young Libor who will do everything in order to protect all, especially Carolynk, from this watery dropout.
What about he's going to be interesting and lying?
Especially when he can prove that Caroline Jonas has rejected and gave priority to his beloved Libor.
In the meantime, it is clear who is able to warm the evening Convicky, marked by mud, fire of the mill and other lottery.
The differences in the village are arranged on a watercourse, and still on Jonah’s head will be an incalculable water curse.
And now Convic's baby Caroline!
How can you persuade the old Hasrbucha, convince the neighbors of Jonah’s innocence, find Jonah and release him from prison?

The experience of most failure is mild, only three percent of patients must be admitted to the hospital
Either the Czechs expand the calmer form of the coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved immunity.
Infectious sections of patients are progressive, even if the number of patients indicated increases.
"This situation today and in depth is completely different and is given primarily by a number of hospitalised people," Confirms Minister of Health Adam Vojtès.
It is recalled that on April 11th, when the first wave of the epidemic hit us, all Russians, the military commissions, the Republic was closed and Czechs were in need of disinfection for the previous year.
Still ten people died every day.
Now the daily growth of the number of people enrolled is higher, but every day with the 19 people die at least two people.
The highest number of inhabitants still have Karvinsko, the same number already has Jihlav because of the fire in the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 employees have already been ordered - 40 customers and 17 employees.

Starting champion!
Van den Bergh wrote my address, Anderson smtl
The great surprise of the tournament in the name of Dimitri van den Bergh presented an excellent performance even in the game with the player who won the second most prestigious PDC company in the framework of the PDC in 2018.
The introduction of the game was extremely balanced, the evil came after 8:7 for the Belgian sticker.
Van den Bergh took a 13-chip bill, and he's been planning since then.
His opponent literally grabbed his game and the most experienced "Flying Scots" only got hard to reach the adults.
The way she had the "Snare of Dreams" in her throat testifies to the fact that the divorced Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th of August.
In addition, young Belgian has mastered excellent checksouts.
Last he lost in a single leg, in a state of infamous condition, but "he caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson saw huge frustration.
The chips were just making him fall asleep, and the triumphal contest began to be subversive.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of the three dates and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The triumph of the trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian cyclists than his first winning major.
And it continues to pay so that the last player who managed to win out of Bergha, is Karel Sedlácek.
In Nantes, the charges for the fire of the cathedral, the man admitted
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original windmill windows of the 16th century and destroyed the walls.
In view of the fires of the three different places, the investigators checked that the fire was used by the temple.
At the same time, the police didn't find any signs of anyone getting violent in the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a nine-year-old Rwandan skirmish.
The police arrested him a short time after the fire, but then they let him go without a criminal attack.
Now the prosecutor reported that on the basis of new evidence, the man was again arrested on Saturday, admitted and accused of jealousy.
In case he'll be chased by a thief, he'll be under ten years of imprisonment and a high prison sentence.
According to his lawyer, his husband is sorry and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, Le Monde wrote.
Leaders: Monday we will present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system has to play a role in the pandemic, because of its absence from government and the Ministry of Health criticism.
"They will be gradually based on the strength of community expansion," the minister explained.
He added, for example, that the Republic of Moravskosles or Prague would reach an average orange level.
The system is proposed as a regional one, because the situation in different countries has improved significantly.
The Ministry worked with epidemiology and the Institute for Medical Information and Statistics (UZIS).
On a separate level, specific measures will be taken by the Minister whether it is already the obligation to carry rice or to organise special units in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie TV series, Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called on people to have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation gets worse.
The daily increase in certified cases in Czech Republic has been seen in recent days, although the number of hospitalised remains low.
The soldiers commented that there was no major incident in the area of the declaration of the state of emergency or the re-election of the state of crisis.
In view of the increasing number of persons charged on Saturdays throughout Czech Republic, the government has again assumed the obligation to carry Russians on domestic affairs over 100 people.
It will be limited to 500 people from Monday, now it is made up of 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear to the last minute, what measures and when they started to pay even when they were announced, was expected to be criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create a sense of security and compare the damage," Senator Marek Hilscher said in Question.
Measures can now be broken down according to the region, for example in Prague since Sunday, the obligation to carry Russians also in non-resident medical devices, for example in medicines or in medical wards.
The obligation to carry Russians on visits to medical and social facilities or doctors has also been imposed by the birds in the Liberian and Austrian countries.
It is necessary to carry Russians in the internal public spaces, MHD and medical facilities from 14 July.
On the other hand, anti-piedemic measures have been released in the Republic of Moravia, just as in the Mediterranean region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government has also adopted a so-called European semafor, which, in colour, distinguishes the risk of prohibitions in individual European countries and, accordingly, regulates the rules applicable to entry into Czech Republic from those countries.
In a country with a low and medium risk of the Authority from 15 June, no negative test on or instead of a quarantine shall be required by the Czech citizens.
They're responsible for returning the Czechs from the country with a high risk.
All EU Member States are now in low-risk categories.

About 2,000 people were on the scene on Saturday morning.
If he didn't reduce the number of participants, the police would be there.
On the TV series Prima Partie said it was Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants decreased below 1,000, the police assessed that the case was not necessary and did not require a health station or the Ministry of Health.
The Czech TV (CT) indicated on Sunday that the technology party was also expanding to the surrounding areas whose owners did not agree with the use of the technology party.
It is possible that owners of the surrounding lands will demand compensation for damages.

Bleeding snakes: She's finished in the hospital!
"The first annual case was recorded in Jeleznorudsk.
The change to the feet of a girl, 2010 whose parents brought herself to the bottom of a foreign rescue service," Daník told the national health care services of Maria Svobodva that children were then transferred to a hospital in Klatwes.
The snake is the only hunting hadam in the Czech Republic, and right on the island of Samoa these animals are being delivered in a higher number, so it is good to take care of them in the past.
However, there is no great danger of these animals.
The chance that you'll get lost is not too high, they're afraid of themselves when they're in regular contact.
And if there's room for it, he's happy to go out for a vote.
It'll only happen if you feel a lot threatened - for example if you're wrong about it.
Even her escape is not a tragedy, her diet is quite effective against little dogs, but people don't die.
This can only happen when a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from allergy.
The risk is, therefore, particularly for children, seniors and allergys.
"A man has often a feeling of withdrawal, sweating, increased fever, nausea, chest pain and vomiting, in weakened units and, in particular, allergic reactions can get into anaphylactic shock," she wrote for Daník Miriam Gredová from the Klatovska hospital.
The man threatened to throw the horse out of the window.
By the police, the wine and the gas supply.
After 9:00 a.m., a backup unit entered the apartment and a man kept it.
The prisoners immediately moved to the hospital, and a press report was sent to the national police in Markéta Janovská.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the police, after the police escorting him to his room, to his knife or to his window.
Several times during the surgery, he was relieved that he had moved out of the window with the child in his arms.
He even went out to the window on his own, where he came back.
The police are still investigating the man.
He doesn't want to publish any further information yet.

Sapa Market: Razia removed the meat, fish and eggs of an unknown origin
"One of the vehicles traveling to the area carried 1320 kussims of undisputed origin, in addition to the adverse conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in an assailant undertaking," the State Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the stock with live fish showed that the seller had no evidence of the origin of the product and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be long-term because of the issue of veterinary supervision.
For example, on the ground in which the veterinarians discovered illegal food sales, it contained almost half the tonnes of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not determined, some of the products were long-lasting and were damaged.
In five kilograms, the duration date was exceeded by three years.
In May, Loni kept a veterinary with the police in the area of the market for 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen cats, which were part of the dance.
Putin telephoned Zelenski before starting to go straight to Donbas, Kreml criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he has to start paying a new sample from midnight.
Putin, according to Kremlu's statement, otherwise criticized the Ukrainian Parliament's decision on the conduct of local elections; Kyev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
In the middle of the evening, Ukraine and Russia agreed to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The approach should begin after midnight at midnight on Monday, be "full and general" and open the way to the fulfilment of other peace agreements.
Putin, in his speech to Zelenski, said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organize local elections rejected the peace agreement from Minsk and threatened the prospects for a confrontation in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the elections held in local representatives would not be effective on the territory of the Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kyev will regain control of Ukraine's occupations by Russian separatists after giving these regions broad autonomy and arrange local elections here.
According to the Union Agency, the Green Office indicated that both states agreed on the prosperity of the existing region of Donbas and on the need to take further measures to support peace in this region, such as the abolition of the war zones or the withdrawal of part of the unit from the front.
The Green House also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied half of Crimea and in Russia alone.
The Minsk Agreement has helped to stop wars, in times of shootings and partial attacks, however, people still die on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since January 2014.
Ukraine and the West blame Russia for the military support of the separatists, which Moscow claims.
Zelensky made the war over in Donbas his priority, to the most important part of the meeting, but it has not yet come.
The unexpected mystery of the decade is Rykl, the seventh ruler of Novotna
The winner of the last two titles did not get to the end of the fourth-century Saturday program, Kopecký did not jump the foundation in the sky on Sunday.
Ten years later, however, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the task of looking at Joseph Karase, left after the discussion.
Rikol had already had two bronze medals from the outside MZR, this time being the only teenager who got across the seven-dimensional border.
Other medals followed by William Straske and Petr Urban.
He recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiry Sykory after the contest.
"I'm sorry there weren't the guys here and Kope didn't put it because those results would look completely different.
But the title is very good, and I appreciate it, especially because I've given myself 30 centimetres away.
Then I was still happy with the bottle and most of all I was disappointed with the disk, and there I was inferior," he admitted to the fresh facebook.
On the first day of the week, she won more than poor Katerina Cachov's move, although she was hit by a wounded knife on her back.
In the long run, however, she wrote only 570 cm, did not pass 40 meters, and did not reach the final osmosis anymore.
Newly collected 5878 points and won 241 points before Katerín Dvorák.
She went out first, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630s.
Yesterday I started to wear a hat, but I am very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't even limit me," said Novotna on his wedding facebook.
To Czecha, there was a LPG, promising organic transport
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in Czechia.
In particular, it is preferred for its main lower price of petrol or oil, which is significantly lower in consumption, and its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and oil, it has its ecologically sharp variant - "Bio LPG".
However, this is the whole news - first appeared on the European market and in Czech press reports, the Czech LPG has arrived a few days ago.
"In these days we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed in conjunction with the classic fossil LPG at our pumping station," says Jiří Karlíka from Primagas.
Also, LPG could not be treated as bioethanol or bionaphthalate.
According to the association, the chemical site is consistent with the classic red LPG, which is now tingling into its motor vehicles.
That's why it's also possible for both versions to move freely.
"The only difference in sales to classical LPG is the way of production," says the former Association President of the LPG Ivan Indraček.
This is also said to be one of the great benefits of the LPG to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and maintain and distribution infrastructure is relatively good, for example, compared with water or electricity.
Currently, this oil is obtained as a further product in the production of bioethanol from the residues of food and sugar.
In the future, it should also be designed and designed, e.g. from cell biomass, and from wood waste.
On the contrary, the classic red LPG appears partly as a secondary product in the refining of oil, partly separated when the soil is heavy.
Thus, depending on the technology of production and the source of bio-LPG transport, 40-70% is more environmentally friendly than the use of crude LPG and up to 90% compared with oil.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of cars, it is also about the environment of fuel production, so the part "well-to-tank" (Czech "source to maintenance").
Among one of the largest producers was LPG currently a petrochemical company, Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is examining the potential for production and company Unipetrol in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the estimates of the association in Czech countries, some 170 thousand vehicles are operating on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports in the NAP CHM on something higher, a total of 200 thousand.
According to the Ministry of Transport statistics, only about 6,000 LPG cars were stopped in the last year.
In the Czech Republic, LPG is possible at a total of 950 stations of different operators.

Mobile choice units or correspondence.
Politologists and sociologists were looking for options for the duration of the pandemic
In order for people in quarantine to vote in the October national and Senate elections, according to Vice-President and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáčka (ČSSD), the law needs to be amended.
Parliament could pass it in August or in September in an accelerated regime.
He introduced it on Sunday at Prima TV.
On Tuesday, he wishes to make a possible solution to Parliamentary representatives.
"If we do anything, it will have to mean a change of the voluntary law," Hamaček said.
The Senate called on the government in the middle to find a solution within the legal framework.
The Minister pointed out, however, that it would be necessary to correct the provisions of the law, so that people in quarantine could not vote because of the state of health.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained for example in patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, in the OVM series, indicated that the possibility of correspondence will be withdrawn since 2004.
And the current proposal of the law, which is in short form, is calculated by its introduction to vote in a foreign country, but not in Czech.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of the ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather be replaced by another type of party) from the corresponding choice for the above-mentioned.
Personally, it is against the possibility of electronic vote, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now there is a need for ad hoc to develop mechanisms (voebs) that could be implemented this year and with the least health risk.
It is therefore considered primarily to be prepared for the year 2021 when Parliamentary elections are held in Czech Republic.
Correspondence will be considered as one of the functional methods.
As is further seen by the above-mentioned electoral units, it may be possible to vote in favour within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections during the Coronavir period - resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
As a result of the expansion of coronavir bans, various types of vote have already been postponed this year in 67 countries of the world.
Protests in Buharsko: The haircuts of the ears of demonstrators on government building
The participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyka Boris and his office were found on the building of the government's dirty ears.
Another of the series of protests against the "Mafian style of governance" that have been held in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning on the middle of the national blockade, the DPA agency said.
Today's protest, which has taken place 18 days after itself, has, according to the Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom Station, had a lower share than before.
At 8:00 a.m., 300 people arrived, some streets had to be closed for transport.
Before the building, the demonstrators collected a theatre scene, where they symbolicly closed the prison cell of Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Geschev in connection with the arrest of two presidents, Romania Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
The rejection of both is a fundamental requirement of protestors.
They also called for the cancellation of the announced medical reforms and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea coast.
Today's protest organizer Nikolay Hadzigen indicated in a public statement that the "scaling peak" is on the centre of the "national demonstration in Sofia and the block in the whole country".
He repeated the request for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as for the release of earlier elections.
Those good things should be done in March 2021.
Borisov had already told me to leave without permission.
This has also led to the need for the Bulgarian people's 19-year-old pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team to ensure that the demonstrations did not interfere.
At the beginning of this week, the government of Boris left a vote on confidence in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants to play games with no monsters
The football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovic already has a lot of fun Italian leagues with no monsters.
The Serbian poet hopes that from the new season the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're doing here right now is not a football.
I've got a lot of fun teeth with no monsters.
It's a free football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those games are worse than a coach.
The game is so terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," Mihajlovic said before today's game against Lecce.
After the coronavir break, the series A matches are followed quickly, and although they play until evening, their players are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a horrible mood.
Under such conditions, he does not even know how the team is.
It's time for this season to end.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from the summit," said a guard who in the past also led Fiorentina or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovice, this season is unusual and because four months on the bottle were missing because of leukemia.
"In spite of my disability, the cancellation of the league and all the others have been directed to our team to assume a high level.
We want to keep growing and we need to make players mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of the cybersex of foreign states, says Iran.
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear devices have been reported to fire and explosions by fire, electricity, factories and companies.
Some Iranians indicated that the fire that took place this month in the underground nuclear power plant in Natanzu could cause cybernetic sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not been explained yet.
A spokesman from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abbás Musávi, said according to Iranian media that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic is headed by "tillions of cybernetic attacks".
He added that it's not about new apples and that most of them can be painted.
In recent months a number of more cybernet attacks have been reported, according to Mussavia, which has been reported to be "increased governments and groups".
However, he did not share any more details about potential customers.
The museum also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
The Iranian State Agency's member IRNA announced this month that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the United States, could be affected by recent incidents.
None of these countries, but were not directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the revolution in 1979 when Iranian military students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held for 444 days as the hands of 52 Americans.
The long-term relationship between the two countries increased in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that had a strong impact on its economy.
Another significant leap came this year after the US Army killed General Kásema Solejminga of Iran on January 3rd and leader of the Iraqi militia, Abu Mahdí Muhandis.
Then, on January 8th, Iran set fire to basics in Iraq, where the United States is headed, the number of rockets.
The U.S. admitted that tens of American soldiers had been wounded.
Israel considers Iran to be its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main supporter of the International Nuclear Agreement with Iran since 2015.

Coronavir is affected by the key markets of companies, such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Old Michael Kašpar (Modification for Kolin) said that the stay of the product in the TPCA is not registered in the city.
"From the beginning it was known, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filled, especially now since Monday, when it's a lot of loose.
So the city is full," Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications, nor do foreign workers who have stayed in residences.
"For the two months we didn't have to solve almost no problem," Kašpar said.
For example, young people in Skoda Auto, who also stopped production due to the Coronovir crisis, reopened it on Monday 27th in all three of its manufacturing companies in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works at 100% capacity.
The renewal of the product in Scotland has carried out more than 80 hygiene measures.
On Monday evenings on Tuesday afternoon, the young Boleslav and Kvasiná were the first to be re-produced after the third production, then the night shift.
At the same time, there are 2500 people working in the TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employees in Kolinsk.

To Brna, Uber will return to offer transport services
To Brna at the end of July, Uber will return to the company offering transport services.
This is the consequence of the amendment to the law, he stated in his fourth press release to the branch for the transport of Petr Kratochvil (ODS).
In contrast to Uberu in Brná, the taxis protested, indicating that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, since July the law has changed the conditions for carrying out regular taxis and these alternatives.
In the past few weeks, Uber's representatives have concluded a few meetings.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brna by the end of July of the year.
This step is the result of changes in the law, which enables this company to carry out its activities legally.
The city was marked by this change and we believe that the company will carry out its services within the limits," Kratochvil said.
Uber moved to Brno in the past.
They protested against him because of the absence of a vehicle as a taxi or a missing taxometer.
The Court issued a preliminary measure which prohibited Uber in the city.
Brno initially supported taxis, but at the end of the year, Markéta Vanęk (ODS) indicated that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brň.
According to the later court decisions, Uber was able to drive to Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now it's coming back on the basis of changes in the law.

Request to call Rafaje Try Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babish (ANO) plans to make a request on a proposal by the Head of Anti-Monopol (UOHS) Petra Rafaje on Monday with the coalic social democracies.
In response to Rafa's call, the non-profit organizations called for the government's anti-corruption council and also the Ustek country.
Social Democrats claim that the change in office is on the spot.
According to information from ČTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the government's office on Monday.
The second term of office ends in the next half of the year, it cannot be appointed by law.
His call is in the position of President Miloša Landan.
According to the challenges of non-profit organisations, he received a letter and a similar request from the Austrian country.
They're supposed to be outside the Rafa's cause since the last time.
In the past week, the prime minister refused to express his wish that he would be familiar with the material and that the government party would take "some opinion".
He also stated that he had not yet met with the president, that he had no meeting with him in the near future.
According to the Opinion of the Committee on Appeals, it is not justified because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Server IHNED.cz and Currently.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafa's meeting with Haytman Jiři Čunk.
In addition, meetings have resulted in a competition decision on the project of a controversial new criminal hospital over eight billion, which is seriously affected by the tsunami.

It also asks for the reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the EAGGF on public contracts under the scheme for the transport of Jaroslav Komínka is not transparent and has its mark.
Loni, a police officer in March, was in charge of the anti-monopolic authority because of the tendency to choose a myth.
This year in June, the server updated.cz warned that Rafaj used to be written on the company of the influential Záculus player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
The estimated 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Authority for the Protection of Economic Competition, Rafaj, appointed the President of the former Social Democrats for the second functional period of 9 July 2009, in June 2015.
Within a few years, Rafa's second six-year term will be extended.
The Anti-Monopol Law states that the President may appeal to the President of the Authority on a proposal from the government.
It may only be rejected if it does not perform the function for a period of more than six months, or seriously violates its function or independence and impartiality.

The problem also arose regularly in cultural rooms at lectures that visit tens of people.
After a few minutes, he couldn't breathe there anymore," said Dlapa.
Initially, the city's representatives wanted to make this year air conditioning in all the libraries.
In the end, only three rounds of five.

So it's actually such a little confusion," said the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition to its approach, the company wants to support the local business.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We are convinced that a large part of our collection has been created so much so that the base of the shirt - i.e. clothes that are excessive and excessive.
Globally, it is a segment of premiums that avoids any typical discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Mička adds.
The cross-graffiti represents the RAF Kurta Taussiga flight
"The task was to create something at the end of the war.
And I remembered our moving pilot who fought in the British Royal Air Force series in World War II.
The proposal for city leadership was popular," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He needed 300 litres of paint and 50 drops of paint.
Kurt Tassig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
As a result of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to the international camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, his brother and his organization, Nicholas Winton, managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Tassig arrived in Great Britain, where he voluntarily entered the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later carried out pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was employed in the war operations early in 1945.
Several times after the Samat revolution, he visited Czech and native Teplice, who had granted him a reputation.
Sixteen-year-old Kamil Vacek, who has been known in the street art industry under Camo's review, has been working in tropical streets for more than 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces that the former Prime Minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) set up for these purposes.
Bourière Hanna reached the coast of Texas
Hurikán Hanna reached the southwestern coast of Texas, Texas, on Saturday afternoon (before midnight at midnight).
He invaded the Texas island of Padre Island, 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and on his move, he landed on a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a serious threat to the inhabitants of the coastal areas.
He brought with him the same strong wind and intense currents; together with the local seas are reported by the AP agency for electricity and various material damages, including other damaged ships.
The Texas governor Greg Abbott has already declared the state of natural disasters and recommended voluntary evacuation on Saturday for 32 days in the southwestern Texas.
The most powerful warning came from the coastal passage between Port Mansfield and the siege of Mesquite Bay, but he had to cross the territory nearly 500 kilometers long before moving progressively over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, a cold rise, a dangerous supply and a single tournament can pose a threat," warned the United States National Centre for Horikan (NHC).
Today's morning of the local time (SELČ Sunday) the storm moved in the America-Mexico border area and extended the wind at a speed of 85 km per hour.
Hannah became the first Hurican season in the Atlantic in Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico he carried it at speeds up to 145 kilometers per hour, but he gradually reduced it to 112 kilometers per hour, which was once again assigned to Hann from the category of hurricanes.
The local authorities called for the storm to wait at home and did not forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to the United States, which is the country that is the most vulnerable of the people of 19.
In view of existing security measures and the need to maintain derogations, there is a major challenge and a case of evacuation.
The provisional exhibitions were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas period, Hidalgo was also caused by one of the buildings as a target after evacuated ones who had a positive test on coronavirus or otherwise had been subjected to a ban.
The local authorities have called on all evacuated to take Russians and disinfectants with them into hiding if possible.
"We don't even have it far behind us.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted AP Chris Birchfield, an agency that works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
The forecast states that in some places it would be possible to break up to 300 millimetres in a few hours, in some cases without 500 millimetres, which, together with the rise of the cold, could cause a series of seats on the coast.
The land enjoys the general value of Colonel Lipkov
President Miloš Zeman, in the middle of examining the generality of Colonel Paul Lipkov.
This is due to a review of the expected incidents of the Ministry of Defence.
As a result of the acquisition of the value of the Brigadier General, Lipky's Serbian approach to the post of Deputy Head of the Alliance of International Division of North-West Affairs in Poland is the result of the acquisition of the value of Brigadier General.
Lipka is now acting as the representative of the head of the Czech Army's underground forces.
The government proposed an increase in the land at the end of June.
Since the beginning of August, the Brigadier General Karl Øhek has been replaced by the Deputy Head of the International Division of the North East in Poland, which is responsible for the foreign-led presence in Poland and Pobaltí territories.
In March he became director of the National cybernetic and Information Security Agency (NUKIB).
The government proposed to the president to lend Lipk the value of the Brigadier General.
According to the Law on Military Appeals, the higher number of soldiers may be awarded at the time of the performance of the elected function or at the time of the performance of the service task required by the higher level of the acquisition.
The position of the Deputy Director of the Alliance Division is equal to the overall value.
The soldier to whom the value was earned has the same rights and duties as if he were named.
However, there is no way to fix the payment that would respond to the given value.
The acquisition of the quantity takes a minute for the reason for which it was provided.
"The Colonel Lipka is very professionally prepared and is a model for the underprivileged.
In a significant way, the task of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of the participation of the army in foreign operations, was involved," the Ministry of Defence indicated in June on the proposal for an increase.
The average increase will take place at 12:30 in the Prague City, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief General of the Aleš Opata.
EU countries have Coronavir standards for flights
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for the travel of the aircraft, which will help to limit the spread of the new Coronavir.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport, Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the maintenance of the distance or the loading of the tyres on the aircraft and on the aircraft, but the average seats on the aeroplanes will not have to be left unattended.
She's been informing the top Reuters agency.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted a German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to comply with these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by the officials and that they still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures shall include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to maintain the recommended derogation in safety controls and flight equipment.
The aircraft must also be equipped with clean air and all information must be available in several languages.
Aeroplanes will also be able to contain medium seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials comply with at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have also resulted in fines.
At the Arctic Spicbergás, the temperature record fell, measured there almost 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen, 41 years old record has fallen," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
On Monday evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, which increased by 0.4 degrees from 1979 to 1979.
The two-year-old Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicberkás, located about 1,300 kilometres from the north end.
Spicbergs burn faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other ends of the Arctic - from Aljašky to Sibiř, which is mentioned in the London report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study.
The average temperature in Špicberkás, according to it, grew from 70 C.E. by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it can even rise to ten degrees if it does not reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
The increase in temperature can result in the dense, ever cold soils, which threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause a greater number of lakes and lakes.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic faunas, such as ice beads or tunnels, which are dependent on ocean ice cover.
Britain, returning from Spain, is waiting for a two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also called on the citizens to avoid all roads to Spain, which are not necessary, because of the risk of spreading poverty.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, however, after their return, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force on Wednesday.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," said the British diplomat in his statement.
"We have always made it clear that if this is necessary, we will immediately remove from the list of these safe countries," he added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcements will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Brits are also concerned whether they will be paid powerlessly if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after their return from the holiday.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne had ten days' leave at Lanzarote, they had to fly on Tuesday.
They've been on their way since December.
"We were supposed to go all the family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a driver and I don't think my employee will agree that I'll be back for two weeks in quarantine," said Metro Hunter.
As regards Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemics.
Over the last two days there have been over 900 new arrivals every 24 hours.
In some areas, authorities have already speeded up coronavir measures, for example, Catalán is trying to limit all night life and to prevent people so that they can get into a lot of trouble.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs further warned of the increased risk of the prohibitions in Catalán, Aragonia, Basque and the region of Madrid.
Model of purchase of electricity from Dukovan perennial government
On Monday the government will buy electricity from the planned new block Jader power plant Dukovan.
The proposal of the law is based on the fact that in case the purchase price is higher than the price of power power on the market, the difference will be paid to all consumers by means of tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, it will have a negative impact on consumers.
Power power is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for the receiver.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for the UN) and the energy company ČEZ have already indicated that the most likely option is that people will be saved thanks to the construction of electricity.
However, analysts note that a long-term view of electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The aim has already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be as low as the market price of power electricity, above it.
The final impact during the application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact is spread between customers according to the size of the railway, either by lower consumption or by electricity consumption, by higher electricity consumption," said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO).
The harvester pointed out in May that he predicts that the wholesale price of power stations and people at the Dukovan building is being produced.
In a negative case, there will be an impact on the 10ths per family year, which, according to him, is far less than people pay for electricity bills in support of so-called supported resources.
It was previously estimated that the purchase price could move between 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 Kč) per megawattodine (MWh).
The previewed material does not contain any proposed amount, shall be included until the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, which is now the most expensive, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 Kč) per MWh.
"In the difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity in the amount of EUR 10 it could make an average household fee of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-wheeled households, which are standardly equipped with electricity, including electrical safe boards and pipes, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - less than 100 Kč/year," he wrote in the foundations for the MPO government.
"We live in a turbulent time.
Pandemic Coronavir showed us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecasting of market prices to be purely speculative," said ČTK's former executive director of the Investment Group Energy Financial Group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law is based on the fact that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO, respectively, by the legal person entrusted to it by the State itself at the advance price determined.
The agreement between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity to be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, and that is repeated, however, only until the completion of the low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production proposal is defined as the production of electricity with a nuclear reactor connected to the electrical system with an installed capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
The hacker pointed out earlier that a new shower block should have a output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodin electricity annually, corresponding to a ten-day expected Czech consumption.
The block should be introduced into operation in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukkovan block was approved by the government on Monday.
The establishment should be financed annually, with a two-percent rate for the operation.
The funding model does not agree with the opposition, and it also addresses the possibility of the Dukovan to establish Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should share 70 percent of the building.
The remainder should be paid to the ČEZ company, which will also rent all the additional costs.
ČEZ Director General Daniel Benez said in April ČTK that the expected sum for the construction of the block at the current prices is about six billion euros (about 162 billion kroner).
The contracts between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry for Local Development has become a two billion media support material
Material that the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to lose in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising allowed in Czech Koruna, a two-billion-dollar agency was set up.
The Ministry of the Interior (for the UN) of the server List of Reports.cz said that the material is still working.
The document in eKlepu (Electronic Library of the Legislative Process) was noted on Friday by Zdorsty.cz.
The Ministry of the Plan caused the spread of road traffic because of the Coronavir.
During the Coronavir crisis, there was a loss of income and media.
The proposal called for the criticism of opposition and representatives of the road movement.
According to the proposal now under review on the website of lydacstat.cz, MMR planned to provide public agencies to support CzechTourism travel money for advertising on television, radio, press, internet, billboards or platforms.
The biggest part of the money, and it's 700 million kroner, to get TV.
Most of them would get private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed data and weeks would get 400 million and the same share would provide MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
The Rozhlas station would get 350 million for the media campaign, from which most of the private stations are back.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LEDs and surfaces on platforms or in meters.
The campaign to support the travel movement in Czech had to start in half of August and last year.
"The material is still working, which is certainly not in the form that should be presented," said Dostalov, without further details from the server List of Reports.
Material criticised opposition, according to the head of the TOP 09 Markets of Pekar Adams, would benefit from the media from the religious funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babish (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this showdown will be made at the bottom of the wave of the wound between the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
Despite the fact that it's actually about helping the media with the crisis.
"It can be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," said Denik N on Friday.
According to it, the budget is two billion oriental.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," he added.
Initiatives Save tourism does not provide a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion dollars for travel companies, not a major advertising campaign," said the president of Tomáš Barčík's initiative on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are found in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, never media, write an initiative in an open letter from the government.
Life-threatening, boiling beer and death as a form of grass
The third album is also dead with name A death is the style of a fireman's chair, an outstanding organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erika Friche, who also left the year ago, on 24 May.
In Fričo's discography is a fifth position and similar to in the previous titles and here is the main focus on Fričo's poetry, which is the very real interpreter.
Frič, in 1949, was deeply influenced by the American Beat generation, and this inspiration was also observed through his own personal experiences and also by many non - religious experiences.
There was also an agitating on him if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, simply tolerant.
He attacks me in this relationship with Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Janu Zahradníčk), masters of passage.
Frič's album offers record of author's reading from 2006, but also the performance with the singers who always made it very sensitive, whether it was already a violinist Josef Klić, or Honza Bartonj and the winner of the Holata.
Help me - love - the words of the Austrian poet Petra Hrušky on the long basses of Frič.
"It has sent a cruel and endless wrath," says Hruška, "to the position of our world with a threatened reward.
The world, which is increasingly falling into the perpetuity of condoms and greed, is increasingly alienated from what his soul has been created - from the mystery of faith, compassion and human intimacy.
He called them the list of those who know that the values for which he was created are interesting, but who also knows that because of the general lack of interest, they can't get rid of them.
They certainly reminded us that a person may have to come to everything dear, but it is not necessary to do so.
If he sells himself to a common accident, he refuses to be skeptical, he is afraid to fail, or he stays in calm and proud of what he believes and what he loves."
Parubek is not my counselor, Hamáček said
The former Prime Minister and President of ČSSD Jiří Parubek is not a paid social democracy advisor.
The President of the Party and Minister of the Interior, Jan Hamáček, only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamack said it on Prima Partie's TV show today.
About Parubek should be Hamáčk’s advisor, the server informed on Friday ListZrávy.cz.
"From time to time we write an essay, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that he did not agree on official and paid cooperation.
According to him, ČSSD does not have the means to spread it for similar purposes.
"That sometimes I read his opinion, so many of such people," he said.
In the next discussion with ODS Ambassador Janu Montenegro's Minister said many ODS members are still "indistinctly listening to the views of Václava Klaus".
This is according to him, because it is an experienced policy and the former chairmanship of the party, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that they're making an affair from that media marked the annual crop season.
On Friday, server ListZrávy.cz wrote that Parubek is the role of Hamáčk's informal consultant.
He also wrote that, at the fourth place of the candidate of the party in the eastern country, the former president of the foreign cell of Peter Bend, who is associated with Parobek and acted as vice president of his party LEV 21.
The Hamaček said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a love jump, he's a cop in the back, he's a Swedish challenger
A 22-year-old American poet has ambition and potential to become the most important competitors of the new ruler.
Now he knows what it is about two years younger Duplantis to win, Loni won her at the NCAA University.
"We had a fight a year ago, then he won and I was second, then we passed it.
In both cases it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who won a 5.95-metre win.
Since then, only Duplantis has been shot at a steep mountain and is currently found in the highest mountain ranges.
In just 20 years, he became a world recordman, and on February 8, in Toronto, he crossed the lake at a height of 6,17 feet [6.17 m], and a week later, he added another centimetre in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters in 18 years when he finished high school," recalled his founder, Nilsen, for the World Games web site.
"It was clear that as soon as he matured from a boy to a man, all his potential and talent were real.
Twenty years is a good time to jump the world record," it is thought.
Being Nilsen's success account is more about knowing the dance than the duplants do, the American is pursuing similar goals.
Meanwhile, he pointed out his chances at the NCAA race, which he won regularly this year, with one of them improving his internal personal record at 5.93. Loni won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima in August, and in 2017 he was engaged in American training at the World Championship, where he finished 13.
The closest milkman for him is first to taste the diamond ligature.
"It is definitely my priority to get to the professional area and run the most in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name," he says.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly carry on the same actions as the Olympic Games, the world's mysteries or the Pan-American Games."
Because of the pandemic, however, these high holidays are rescinded, which gives Nilsen and the others time to improve.
But will it be enough to take Duplantise, which can easily turn the race under five circles into a single glass file?
"Everyone's trying to reach it, but I don't think it'll be possible in the near future," Nilsen says.
"This boy's been jumping for 16 years and he's got over all the other love jumps."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he'll want to find her again.
A woman lost statistics on invalidity pensions for an unaccompanied son.
She's waiting for trial.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily designed to improve the quality of his life.
She's been under the threat of rape for eight years.
Because of a poor health situation, the judge of the patient’s right to sovereignty and his mother established a guardian who was to save his sons’ money.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to January 2013 used part of the financial resources of the disabled son's pension for her needs and prepared it for 440 thousand kroner," reported police spokesman Dana Ladman, stating that the accused woman was obliged to cover the interests of the injured woman in particular.
According to the instructions of the Court of Justice, a woman had set up an account for her son, since his pension was allowed to be sent to her account.
"After payment of the costs associated with the stay of the son in the medical facilities and the compensation of the necessary medicines, she used the remaining financial resources for the purchase of vehicles, electricity and household goods," she complained.
That the son's money can't be used for his needs, the woman admitted.
But she felt that she helped them pay for family expenses.
"We had problems with our income to prevent homelessness.
We've never bought anything that's too standard.
It was always on the things the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't feel like I'd let this criminal act go," the woman explained to the police.
She promised her son's money would come back.
North America has been isolated for 30 000 years, says scientists after finding tools
The findings of the Chiquihuite lake in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include the 1930s instruments of heating, among which there are also fine sharps that could be used to cook meat, and spicy objects that could serve as shells or copies.
The researchers found that the oldest of the instruments were from 33 000 to 31 000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this old age.
But they're here," said archeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published in the journal Nature.
The latest tools reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the people of Chiquihuite lakes, located at the great sea level, lived for 20,000 years.
After all, the generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens passed through the fortress bridge of today's Russia in Alaska 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique sizes of copies used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, showed that this cloning culture has subsequently expanded in much of North America.
This model, however, was obtained in recent decades when several long sentences were discovered, which were two to three thousand years old.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, there are 42 different locations throughout North America that show human presence on the continent already in the period from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that small numbers of people could come to the North American fortress before it was predicted.
Some could get ships in America.
"It is clear that people in America were long before the development of so-called classical culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Canada, Albert.
The interest in flying is already filling up an optimistic scenario, claims the seller.
The prices are gradually reduced.
He sells a plane in Czech, growing every week.
In contrast to late summer, interest is still high on average, but demand increases by up to 20 per cent each week.
After the crisis, according to the sellers, development complements the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of the flight are gradually reduced.
The most sought-out destinations are according to the sellers, in particular the southern European States.
According to the Kiwi.com data, they lead Spain, Italy and Greece.
The airport of Letuska.cz is the largest to sell flights to the Croatian Split.
Other countries, then, are the most sought-after Great Britain, which is also the most experienced destination ever.
The average flight price is also reduced.
In the Portal of Latvia.cz in half of the month, the hole moved around 6250 kroner, an average of 3000 kroner less.
This is prompted in particular by an increase in demand for a European destination, which now generates about 85% of sales.
They also offer the same prices in some European places, such as Spain or Italy in the past weeks, about five.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who now buy flights much smaller than before because they fear further developments in the coronavir situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the buy-in period before the departure has reduced the average noise for 10 days.
"It confirms this future trend when people will order flights with much less advance, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President of Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
The number of renewed flights from Česka with sales increases is also increasing.
At present, regular lines to more than 60 destinations are operating on the Prague airport.
It's about half the destination against the late summer season.
Big finals already tonight!
Follow the jumper battle of life on New Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organisation has led to a great final.
It presents an experienced 19-year-old Scottish poet Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson ordered Justin Pipa in the first wheel, then found his neighbor in the table pocket.
However, he consulted James Wad, and in the quarter, he was badly injured with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent the world's unit home.
"Flying Scott" had a little bit in the semi-finals when Michael Smith crossed.
But for the last time, he fled the dignitaries from the thief, in the extension of his domain, and, as a result of 18:16, he fought a place in the final tournament, which he ruled in 2018 when Mensura Sullivice 21:19 was defeated in a great battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play just fantastically.
The six-year-old skipper first miraculously organized the world's sixth, Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle, and also Joa Cullen, and in the fourth round after the sharp move, followed Adrian Lewis.
The big check was semi-fixed.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the start, but in the calmness of the Belgian player, then the winning series got a hit, and then most of the time, without problems, he kept up to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high tendon, which caused temporary insecurity on the doubles.
Coronavir events occurred at least from the beginning of the week, decreased the number of tests
Since the beginning of March, when a new coronavirus in Czechia first appeared, 15 212 people have been reportedly raped.
About 9,600 of them have already been treated, 368 patients have died.
At present, there are 5,254 patients.
This is based on data from the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of new certified cases in this week was four times more than two hundred.
The maximum was 281 cases.
On Thursday, there were 235 positive tests, 246 days ago and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of the week, 169 persons were enrolled.
From the 19th century, 9 590 people were already treated in Czech, and 63 percent of all infected people were already infected.
In most cases, she had a disease of peace.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people are treated with coronavir, 19 of which are considered to be important.
In Czech, there's a couple of fires inconsistency covid-19.
The largest recorded in the last seven days in the budget for the 100 thousand inhabitants continues to be shown in Karvinsko, which is almost 59.
It follows the period of Jihlav with 56 and Frídecko-City with 36 registered 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
As a result of an increase in the number of payments received in Czech since Saturday, new measures against the spread of coronavir have been taken.
People have to wear roses on internal collective actions over 100 people, it's cultural and sports, but it's also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, then, the capacity of these actions will be limited to half a billion people.
In the world, the number of people who have been deliberately raped by a new coronavir has exceeded the limit of 16 million.
It was introduced by the U.S. University of Johnse Hopkins, which is a global pandemic development.
The balance of the victims who died from poor people-19, according to this source, is close to 645 thousand.
The most recent million infected have come to statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on 22 July.
Most of the rapid increase in the number of cases occurred in recent days in the United States, which already accounts for more than 4.1 million infected people, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where there were almost 1.4 million people, according to the authorities.
There's a record temperature right now.
The World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday, more than 284 thousand new cases have occurred worldwide, which is the highest daily average since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to an increase in the number of new cases in recent weeks in almost 40 countries around the world, in the United States, Brazil or India.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, or Israel.
The ban has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, and the first case has been officially announced today by KLDR.
The air in the homes is up to five times higher than the outside.
Treatment of air pollutants and deodorants
Health endangers not only the bad air quality in outdoor areas but also the home.
The Israeli team on human health, Carol Abraham, quoted the newspaper The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for creating the Israeli Ministry of the Protection of the Environment, it is necessary to focus on damages in homes right now when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the U.S. Environment Agency (EPA), according to which domestic air quality is up to five times higher than outdoors.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that because of the bad air quality in its homes, it kills 3.8 million people a year earlier.
"Because of the Coronavir epidemic, which has caused many people to work from home, people have to spend more hours at home than before, so it's time to focus on the quality of the air in the homes," said Abraham.
In Israel, according to it, there is almost no one remaining in the "home air" quality.
The danger can be things that a person usually comes into contact with — nature, air pollutants, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"The burning gas also produces clothes that we regularly carry into the kitchen," said Abraham.
The most threatened are children, elderly members of the home and people with breathing problems.
Otherwise, healthy individuals can begin to suffer problems such as headaches, nausea, difficulty in walking, nose bleeding, vomiting, or skin allergy.
In the long term exposure of undesirable substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all damages but come from items inside the house, the source can also be material from which houses are built.

Karel Gott didn't like Václava Havla?!
Dominica's daughter took it off.
"My father didn't have him for many years," said the eldest daughter, Gott Dominica, with the fact that the Minister couldn't come to Havl's name and whenever the word came to him, Karla was always angry.
It's hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute has sometimes begun in the mid-1990s.
"The father, in an article after the revolution, said that he had more than he had.
That Havel could write in the dark of time into the hole, but if he got a little upset, he would have finished his career," says Gott.
The return, however, adds that in the end the great ones have only found their way to them.
"I know that the word Havel couldn't even hear in his sixty.
But then the president congratulated him by writing to his parents and immediately began to change his relationship with him," Dominica recalls.
Ten years later, even Gott invited the former president to celebrate his seventy years in the hotel of Ambassador to the Václav city.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because then Mr. Havla regularly called home to Bertramk," added the blonde whose father died in October.
The festival also held that Václav Havla never received a national registration.
However, he was only expected in 2009, even though it was already with his successor in the function of Václava Klaus (79).
The next poem is a memorial, the current President Miloš Zeman (75) has yet to give him the Red of the White Lion and thus learn his memory.
