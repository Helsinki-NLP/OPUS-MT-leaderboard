Since how much do you feel about these symptoms?
and all the thoracic pain must be treated in this way, especially at your age.
and especially if you have the fever.
and your cholesterol and your tension must also be controlled.
Did you have the fever right now?
Do you feel thoracic pain right now?
Do you also have difficulty breathing?
Can you tell me if you have any other symptoms?
And how many of you have I had to be?
And I'm all right.
And I've got a little rhyme and I'm all
And I'm really sorry about the poet today.
Is the current period conducive to your smell of beans?
And I've got those pain in the chest.
And I think I have a little fever.
Can you tell me where you feel the thoracic pain?
And they have a little of it, too.
and with your diabetes history
And you know I've got the impression that my chest's going to collapse.
And you know people touch me all the time.
and you have pain in the chest.
And you said you felt a pressure in the chest.

Is there any other sick people in your home with the same symptoms?
Have you had any other symptoms?
Are you out of your mind?
You still have pain in your chest?
'Cause it's the flu season
but we should no longer remove the possibility of a thoracic pain associated with a heart problem
but this pain in the chest is a more important problem now
but I have difficulty breathing
But I know that many people touch me.
but we must deal with all the pain in the chest with the greatest care
But you're usually breathing right now, aren't you?
Because I completely forgot about this pain in the chest
is that you have the impression that you understand the powder
you are still offline
Are they complaining about being sick or having similar symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic affection such as hypertension or something similar?
Do you have other diseases, chronic medical problems, such as diabetes?

Do you know what symptoms she had?
You see the picture?
a lot of liquids today
but I'm testing for diabetes.
but it has symptoms that are rather similar to those of men.
How old are you?
What's your tension?
if you always have a strong fever

I have some difficulty breathing too.
I'll send you an image
I'm sorry about the poet today.
I've got headaches and a little fever today
I think it's the flu
I think it's a little flu.
It's like a very heavy person was sitting on your chest?
it started with headaches with fever at the same time
It hurts in the middle of my chest.
It's an oppressive pain in the chest

It's at the center of my poitrine.
It's in the center of the poitrine.
I have a pain in the chest
This thoracic pain worries me very much
I want you to describe this pain in the chest
like hypertension or diabetes
as a pill at the center of the poitrine
now against fever you can take paracetamol
Mary, it's been a long time now that you have symptoms
you now say you have a pain in the chest
I've sometimes been hurt by the poitrine.
Okay, you have other symptoms in addition or just this pain in the chest.
Or any seat on your chest?
almost the same as fever and cough, headache and muscle pain
in the middle of the poitrine
Show me on this picture where you're wrong
since you've had the fever.
So do you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?

Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The combined incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows a similar evolution in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
Italy's experience shows that countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a small number of COVID-19 patients in need of care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an unknown epidemiology pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control identified the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been baptized with coronavirus (COVID-19).
To date, about 80 per cent of COVID-19 people are suffering from an illness, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are healing.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 has a more severe impact on hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a serious form of disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the COVID-19 cumulative impact in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (U.S.) and compare it with the evolution known to the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri and al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe following the definition of WHO cases.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (U.S.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPCM), the number of cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as health departments, national and regional health authorities in different countries as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data have been used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to establish a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we have calculated the impact combined with 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country from 15 March 2020 to 8 p.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the incident combined with 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the combined impact of COVID-19 has begun to grow around 21 February before a dramatic increase in around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This evolution was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have presented a similar increase in the cumulative impact of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in relation to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases reported by COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that pandemics progress at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in the definitions of cases, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purpose of confirmation of COVID-19, including for retreading tests.
In early March 2020, Italian doctors indicated that about 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (not presented).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed an important difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 litres per 100,000 individual in Germany to 4.2 litres in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 litres in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios on the saturation of the capacity of care, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalised cases associated with a risk & gt; 90% of excess capacity in intensive care are provided in the sixth update of the CPCM's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally welcome a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care should be set at level 2 of the Statistical Units Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare for a Community-supported SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of care, in particular intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out by the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, through an initial approach to an early approach to landing, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases could not be allowed enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if nothing has been implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also covers public health measures that will reduce the impact of pandemics.
There is a short window in which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without it, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a few patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The disease epidemic in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 deaths in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its approval, SARS-CoV, which causes thousands of cases of SRAS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by noise keys and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 presents a greater seriousness and mortality than SRAS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people than young people and increases men and women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide an adequate and comprehensive review of the subject of full research.
We will address the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will participate better in the understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The spring Festival, on 25 January 2020, has never seen the Chinese, who have been forced to stay closed for all the gold week and for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to Coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003 and is therefore baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and associated disease called Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before it expanded to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nej.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 work was published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 on the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review aims at synthetizing the progress of research on this new topic in full.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SRAS and another coronavirus disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic in 2012).
We will also focus on what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and predictation, and we will address some issues still pending but urgent.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered to be non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common rhumms 4.
However, during this century, we have known two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for the Human, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused an epidemic that had begun in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of coronavirus in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1, pneumonia outbreaks then unknown were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Commission for Health.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic was rapidly spreading to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with the interruption of its entire public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan marine fruit market, considered to be the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified for the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of the drafting of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure.2).
To the extent that the situation is rapidly changing, the final extent and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, of which 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overall view of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly within 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in caves, mainly in the province of Hubei and in Periphery.
The average duration between the occurrence of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base production rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC to 95%: 3.51-4.55), and R0 adjusted was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected has increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincides with the mass movements that took place before the spring festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (human), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large infected viruses containing a simple brin ARN.
They can be classified into four species, namely alpha, beta, gamma and Delta, known coronaviruses to infect the Human belonging to the alpha and beta species.
Spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope is attached to angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme and peptidase-4 dipeptidyl (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane merger occurs.
The viral ARN gene is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the genomic ARN accompanied by glycoproteins of cover and nucleocapside protein forms of vehicles containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken on the site of the epidemic’s origin, the Huanan marine fruit market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the help of the transmission electronic microscope, SARRS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in respiratory pathways.
ACE2 was identified as a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S is associated with ACE2 less human than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-COV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the Orf3b and a secret protein coded by the Orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 Orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNB's expression; however, the Orf8 does not contain known areas or functional reasons.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., presented the ECE2 complete cryo-ME structure to a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the transporter B0AT1 amino acids.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compliances, was assembled in diameter and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening in order to eliminate the infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Original host and intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-COV and MERS-COV are sourced with raw keys and that they have been transmitted to the Human via civilians and camels, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the sauries were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SRAS-type coronaviruses from the souries called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that has allowed the virus to break the barrier of species to infected Man remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be elucidate.
Ji, and al., have issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted to humans by snakes, which would involve a homologous combination within protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a mammifer in the long museum feeding furmises, often used in Chinese traditional medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by genetic homology by 99% between a coronavirus found in the pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % between two genes is a difference of importance; it is therefore appropriate to wait for final results to establish concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40 to 50 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
It would seem that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; Ether, ethanol at 75 %, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively disable the virus.
The entire human population is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously carried out on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4.4).
In general, when a host virus is infected, it is first recognised by the immune system in which it is introduced by MRLs, including type C lectin receptors, Toll receptors (TLR), NOD receptors (NLR) and RIG-I type receptors (RLR).
In various ways, the virus induces inflammatory factors, dendritic cells mature, and type I interface synthesis (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophasis of viral antibodies.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response combines the fight against the virus.
Lymphocytes T, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in the defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells that produce specific virus antibodies, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humanitarian immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes localized explosions of free radicals, which can cause serious injuries to the lungs and to other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multi-visceral failure, death.
The infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by a feed appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with conorbidities and pregnant women.
It is widely acknowledged that persons exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are committed are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be from 1 to 14 days, but more generally from 3 to 7 days after a study on the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a feeder ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, has concluded a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) following a demography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after a period of incubation as clearly as possible, in order to avoid the transmission of the virus by persons infected but asymptomatic.
In general, persons exposed to, or infected by, the virus are stored in quarantine for 14 days.
Does the quarantine have to be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often the first and main symptoms of COVID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, rash, muscle pain, vomiting, headache, headache, diarrhoea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had a dyspnoea and/or hypoxia a week after the disease appeared.
With regard to serious cases, patients have rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients presenting fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those presenting acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiographic anomalies, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 showed that patients were suffering from fever at 98 per cent, drying at 76 per cent, dyspepsia at 55 per cent and diarrhoea at 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients needed ventilator assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies conducted on a family and on a site that appeared following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80 per cent of patients with COVID-19 require ventilator assistance, as well as patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher MERS loyalty compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and gastrointestinal disease (21%) have also been observed in patients with MERS.
With regard to SRAS, it was found that the main symptoms were fever (99 per cent to 100 per cent), dry cough (29 per cent to 75 per cent), dyspepsia (40 per cent to 42 per cent), diarrhoea (20 per cent to 25 per cent) and stomach disease (13 per cent to 25 per cent), and that ventilator care was required for about 14 to 20 per cent of patients.
On 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, for 66,576 cases confirmed worldwide.
Similarly, the mortality of SRAs in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) to 95% of 5,71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only reached from 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less subtle.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it has been for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a nest often intervenes within a family or in a collection or vehicle, as in the case of a cruiser.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or in other affected regions, or have been in contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to the occurrence of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carriers of the virus without such symptoms for more than two weeks and that retable patients can be re-porteurs of the virus, stressing the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and a virus were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels high in blood, and most had a higher rate of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte seduction.
In the most serious cases, the D-diener rate, a fibrine degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
Anomalies of thoracic radiographation are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral inegal clouds or an opacity of glass depletion at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the gas trade.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surface rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increase the risk of pulmonary collapsing.
As a result, the most worrying theoretical examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a decline in pneumocytitis, hyalinic membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleus syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, coincided with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and appeared to patients with SRAS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was then not only on the RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SRAS.
Thus, the combination of medical ancestors, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological tests is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using an active band in less than one hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice, if its use on clinical specimens would be complete.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of treatments that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MSRS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, retable plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even retable patients plasma has been proposed for treatment purposes.
The pharmaceutical companies are all used to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects lungs in the first time and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve the symptoms and save lives; it includes general oxygenotherapy, high-debital oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, according to the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should receive an extra-body membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivative technique used to treat heart failure or critical respiratory failure.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that an excessive reaction of the immune system causes cytokinetic shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a systemic inflammatory response form characterized by the release of a whole range of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNβ, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multi-viscera failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, particularly for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokinetic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinetic shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, blocking IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokines 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SRAS in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, high dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would have serious side effects, including osteoencrosis, which would significantly affect the forecast.
However, the use of low-moderate short-term corticosteroid cycles was recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
No effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed at the time of the drafting of this report.
However, the intravenous administration of reddesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has proved effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Reddesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed from Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
As a result, the amdecivir has also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other viruses to simple brin ARN, including MERS and SRAS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the composition to China in order to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon α, lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatment for patients suffering from acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury, and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir association.
Interaction with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Plasma for retable patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients with infectious diseases in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from it is an anti-straal practice.
In fact, retable patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies against pathogens.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
The plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients with COVID-19 gyri and was injected into 10 serious patients.
Their symptoms have improved at 24 hours, associated with a decrease in the inflammation phenomenon, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some adverse events associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
Antibodys, for example, may cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and plasma demand to treat patients severely ill is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce very quickly specific antibodies to fight a global epidemic.
As a result, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells from retable patients and identify genetic codes for the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the major proteins of the virus.
This would speed up the production of antibodies.
The MTC has been used for thousands in China to treat a wide range of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis, based on the MTC theory.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their best associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective COVID-19 treatment, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or severe disease recovery.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have found effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 have been observed in the provinces of China which have applied to MTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the province of Hubei, with only 30 per cent of the patients receiving COVID-19, represents the lowest cure rate (13 per cent).
However, this is rather approximate because many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study that compared treatment with Western Medicine (MO) only and combined treatment with MO and MTC.
It appears that the duration of return to normal body temperature, the duration of loss of symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were much shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the severity rate of symptoms (severely mild) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); also, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and inequity of the MTC remains to be clarified through more and more controlled tests.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of the treatment of MTCs or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a living concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those places in quarantine also experience a feeling of anger, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoglycaemia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments such as corticosteroids, can cause increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SRAS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotive excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, in response to public health services at the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and cause some of the diseases to be blamed for the effects of contamination, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other individual in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and specific updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans, as well as the use of electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain of animal reserves and human beings infected with vulnerabilities, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Life-threatening vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on models submitted to lethal provocation as well as their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as long as no clinical study has been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SRAS grew up 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, the cases and sporadic shelters of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and in other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Several vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS with the help of an inactive virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and combination protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunised individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important duration (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in coronavirus.
As a result of an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the disease is gradually resuscitated without delay.
However, in the context of SRAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, setting a prognostic model is essential for health agencies to be able to give priority to their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies so far, the factors that can affect or be associated with the forecast of patients with COVID-19 are the following (Table 33):
Age: age was the main factor for the SRAS forecast, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over 50 years, according to a study of 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients with a need for intensive care were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a predictor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more people than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart attacks and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in SRAS patients.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2's positive cholicholycytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interact with each other.
abnormal laboratory results: the rate of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or Tissular lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the rate of CRP and severity and the forecast of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT) and kinase creatine (CK) may also participate in the development of the prognostic.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, including the heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
Therefore, they are traditionally marked for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiographics and the gradual progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with other elements for the determination of COVID-19 prognostics and complications.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are common immunosuppressors used to treat infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
Since high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used for severe cases of SRAS, many survivors have presented osteoencrosis resulting in permanent incapacity and quality of life.
Therefore, the administration of steroids in patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration, if necessary.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has caused a large number of cases of exceptional stress, often known for long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of close or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 seems to present different epidemiological characteristics of SRAS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 also effectively responds to higher respiratory pathways and does not treat or treat symptoms in the first phase of infection, including coronavirus in the origin of common rhumms.
Consequently, newly infected individuals or during incubation period may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-COV was transmitted by patients seriously ill, with very low transmission probability in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than it was in SRAS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued deployment of quarantine of almost total population in order to interrupt the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
While these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the growth phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., I believe that the COVID-19, which seems to be much more infectious than the SRAS, will not extend in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., developed a model to predict the outbreak of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the removals of the average nasal cornet and the gorge of patients retables, two weeks after their hospital departure, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode at the start of the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, Ebola virus had to lead to up to one million cases and one half million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 decreases in terms of infection to eventually expand or develop into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SRAS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by waves or aliens, as well as possible by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in cells, thus opening up a new possibility of feco-ral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41 per cent of the cases were possibly caused by noccomomal infections, with 17 patients with prior diseases and 40 health professionals.
Thus, precautions should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or persons affected.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected goutlets or their deposit on surfaces where they may be transmitted to other persons.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of viruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5 per cent of the virus capable of penturing completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, since they both measure about 85 nm.
Since the individuals are able to pass through five surgical masks improvised to each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients carry N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjustable insulation blouses in order to further reduce contact with the viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye route.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor found himself infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he carried a mask N95; the virus could have damaged his body by eye contact due to inflammation.
As a result, health professionals should also carry transparent visas or protection nets to the patients.
For the populations of affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash your hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to stay confined to the maximum and to limit all contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for Human, its high level of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, has to have placed China in high alert status after the SRAS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention would reassure the population by stating that the new virus was harmless, that it had a limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message has resulted in a remarkable relief, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missing.
The Chinese disease control agencies must learn lessons and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more careful in their public announcements, as each word can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) demonstrate greater sensitivity and reactivity to the unusual clinical data than to wait for formal reports of doctors or official bodies; (3) show more restrictive to contain potential epidemics at their beginnings than to try to encourage the population; and (4) to achieve more targeted and relevant exercises to raise the population's awareness of epidemics, but also to test and improve the system of society's response on a regular basis.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it extended to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that COVID-19 symptoms are also close to SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as a pre-vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SRAS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and increases men more than women; pregnancy and mortality rates are also more important among older people.
SRAS presents a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SRAS was mostly transmitted by patients seriously ill; therefore it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection tests may appear negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, rebound patients can be re-positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of proliferation.
Despite the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of critical issues remain pending, including:
Where's SARS-CoV-2 coming from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SRAS-type coronaviruses, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-COV-2 comes from chiropteres.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, such as the sauries, to the Human?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can take place at any time.
A molecular modelling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate directly into respiratory cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Is the virus also present in the cells expressing ECE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve on the genetic level during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear as SRAS or re-surface regularly as flu?
It is essential, even if this may take time, to get answers to all these questions as well as to many others.
However, regardless of the costs this must entail, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the period of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodeficiency patients have had severe respiratory infections below.
The first case of SRAS occurred in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Without counting the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could probably trigger two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV are initially exposed to myalgia, headaches, fever, malaise and fever, follow-up of dyspnoea, swelling and respiratory stress such as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver failure tests and high kinase creatinine are current anomalies observed in laboratory analyses in SRAS suspected cases.
In patients with SRAS, spread of epithelial cells and increased macrophages have also been observed.
Some 20 to 30 per cent of patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodeficiency patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was common among young children, elderly people and immunodeficiency patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is present in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal removal of a boy of 8 months of pneumonia, in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is in fact present in the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called chroup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and bronchioliitis.
At HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
In general, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and keep themselves continuously in man, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestations are similar to those of SRAS and are characterized by evolutionary acute pneumonia.
Contrary to SRAS, many patients suffering from MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to pathology in HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high rate of death, 34.4 per cent, which is one of the most deadly viruses known in man.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the six other HCOV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the period of incubation and the duration of HCV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community HCOV (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in cell samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-term spread after transmission to humans, will have an impact on the final target of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four Community HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms are well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
In order to produce this, HCoVs must be applied to human beings in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the host's restrictions.
In this perspective, the more SARS-CoV-2 epidemics persist and the more infected people are important, the more chance the virus is to adapt completely to man.
If appropriate, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or by other measures to control infections.
For many years, the four CVs acquired in the community are moving around within the population, triggering a simple rhum of immunocompetitive subjects.
These viruses do not need to store animals.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogens, are not well adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zootic reserves and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate and amplifier guests.
SARS-CoV-2 presents similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOVs acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired in community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will move around among these last without reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing HCV animal origins, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, reserves, intermediate and amplifiers of HCV.
An animal serves as a evolutionary host of a HCoV if it opens a close-up with a high-level homology of nucleotide sequence.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogen for its host.
In the same way, a reservation host opens the HCoV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to the intermediate guest and even establish a long-term endometrial.
In this case, the intermediate hotel becomes a natural reservation hotel.
In particular, given that 80% of Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also serve as amplifier intermediate guests cannot be excluded.
These sound keys are positive for anti-SARS-COV antibodies and for the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the basis for a new concept whereby the raw keys are the host of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that the WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that the raw keys are not the host to reserve SARS-CoV immediately.
That's why noise keys can't be the intermediate storage host of MERS-CoV.
In addition to studies conducted in the Middle East, thinkers have been sero-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize the MERS-CoV, as well as the original camels of the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camel excavates the virus not only by breathing pathways but also by faeces, which is also the main route of excretion of the souri keys.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal guests.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-COV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from Pangolin.
Recombination is a major factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOV, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be above the CV key, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rats.
On the other hand, HCV-229E was genetically associated with another Souris Key CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while Camelians were also suspected of being intermediate guests.
When HCV-OC43 opened the barrier of species to human infection from domestic beet to about 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of the inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the close key of the HCV-229E has been found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have a contact with raw keys in a shared ecological nest.
On the contrary, humans have close contacts with the alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the souris key as shown in HCoV-229E are numerous and not pathogens in the souries, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga has caused a respiratory disease in the infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, noise keys are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that noise keys can transmit HCoV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the sour key serves as the genetic reserve of HCV-229E, alpagas and ruminants could serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-COV.
The MERS-COV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of raw keys to ruminants and to ruminants to humans.
The evolutional origin of the MERS-CoV found in the souri keys is known through its initial identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been present in the miners for decades.
It was well adapted to these camels, which have been served as an intermediate guest hotel with stable natural reserves.
Contrary to the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of Pangolins in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-COV is highly pathogenic in the pangolins.
Several inter-species of SARS-CoV-2 have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, noise keys could be the host to store a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological nest with the sour-keys through the pressure or carbon mines.
Second, Pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifiers to which a virus associated with SRAS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Human beings contract the virus by depletion and consumption of gibir meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species that have been both in contact with the souries and pangolins.
Research on SARS-CoV-2's animal origins is ongoing.
Compared to other simple-bred ARN viruses, estimated CV mutation rates could be considered to be "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, according to the CV adaptation phase to new guests.
However, CV mutation rates are approximately one million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CVs do not fit well into the host.
With regard to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already been adapted to another nearby host of people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the rummers.
In theory, genetic origin is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 inefficient in short term.
Thirdly, the CVs change slowly and often models when replication of the ARN through a single "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for the CoVs observed in the animal, such as SL-CoV and the BatCoV-HKU9.
Interaction virus-host in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors listed above, the viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
The SARS-CoV combination is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to human beings.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit means that the closet of this S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic chryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between SARS-CoV ACE2 and SARS-CV protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In addition, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl silic acid for HCV-OC43.
The divergence of human protein and HCV natural reserves, such as raw keys, ruminants and rounds, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
New HCOV Emergency: Back to the Home Case
The diversity of key-sourish CVs offers many emergency opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this sense, the CVs are genetic reserves of HCV.
Among SARS-CoV's accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered to be important in human adaptation, given that SARS-CoV key viruses were isolated, but were coded by different ORF8 proteins.
This removal divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is presented as an adaptive change that contributes to the change in the host.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has been known to combine episodes between different lines, which have occurred in the miners in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the noise and chamomile viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple nucleotide insertion, which will trigger a decline in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also encouraged by the selective pressure exerted on their reservation guests.
Cases of asymptomatic or moderate symptoms have been detected when noise keys were infected by the CVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CVs and the noise keys.
It seemed that the sound keys were well adapted to the CV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the soybean keys effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen (DRO) derivatives generated by high metabolic activity of dry keys could both eliminate the replication of the CV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and lead to highly pathogenic viral suctions when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogens of CVs could also develop by recombination, triggering the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, this is not a hazard if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
The CVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to be reserved for such keys and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where they live the secrets of the observation of asymptotic carriers and the cause of severe infections in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivity of immune response and cytokinic shock; the more immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was obtained from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of infection to SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammase is weak in the dry keys.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammase with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-Cov of soybeans sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a CV of Souris sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-COVs were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate guests or that Pangolin's beta-Cov may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CVs have come under fire because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV exists in the miner for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as this has been done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurring MERS epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CVs travel in nature.
In particular, key-sourish CVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity of contamination.
Continue monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of CVs and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoos is to stay away from the ecological networks of natural zoos.
Firstly, if the souries transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the Pangolins, it would be interesting to note what conditions the souries and Pangos could share the same ecological nest.
Second, if noise keys play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans get in touch with noise keys.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, sour keys and penguins.
Whether it's a sour key, a pangoline or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural guests.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhum, for example, by preventing the hands from touching your eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reduction in the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of respiratory infections; and reduction of respiratory infections;
and the reduction of infant mortality rates at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea may be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in the soap.
The pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of death among children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The washing of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Small hand washing can cover the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could result from excemism or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and dementia, and particularly frequent in health workers.
The excessive washing of hands is also considered to be one of the symptoms of the complex obsessive disorder (TOC).
The elimination twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands to the soap and brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothbrush, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of experts and researchers is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleaner given that lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to solve in the water.
The solid sand, due to its reusable nature, can recover bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antibiotics or recommended disinfectants allows the target of antibiotics resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotics resistant strains are not the product of antibacterial knowledge, these latter may not be as effective as announced.
The most complex formulas may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) which are used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menhol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the public health school of the University of Oregon indicated that ordinary knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate manicures.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, cold water and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural salts and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of hot water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-acoustic hands hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with an exacerbating agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a freezingr such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or mussel for a greater ease of use and reduce the effects of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol effectively eliminate the germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERW), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as champagne.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to well swallow or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products has led to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace an adequate washing of hands unless you have no water and sufficient washing.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emulsifiers and/or skin hydrating agents.
The alcohol sensitizer can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial swabs or detectors.
The dermatitis of allergic contact, contact urticaria or hypersensitive to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, products not those products do not eliminate the organic material present on the hands, but only to disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogen agents, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formula used in benzalkonium chloride has presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin discomfort.
The earth or the earth can be more efficient than the water alone, but less than they know.
In addition, if soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of cold.
At the end of the shower, the sink is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends the burial or sand as an alternative to the sand when it is not available.
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of the boiling water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to differ).
To move a generous amount of soap on their hands by chasing each other, without forgetting the two hands, between the fingers and under the angles.
The soap removes the skins of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than water alone.
Flotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of fracter creates friction, which helps to eliminate the wounds of the skin, and to freeze longer times remove more breasts.
Swimming enough to the current water.
Retaliation in a steaming water pool can lead to hand retamination.
Seat with a free or private service.
The most often forgotten areas are the dust, the poignant, the area between the fingertips and the bottom of the angles.
Artificial angles and vertebrate angles can be hosted by microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when robin water and/or soap are not available. For example, to warm up water from a bitwood or a suspended and dry soil and/or use it to cook if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as typpy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a cord, and a pedal that allows a small amount of water to be poured on the hands and a soap bread.
The effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper services are much more hygienic than electrical dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in hot air drying, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by 194 per cent on the lungs and 254 per cent on the lungs.
The drying in the air by jet resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the dust drop of 42% and on the ground floor of 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations of the bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different hand mill manufacturers, and hand mills have been compared to drying using paper services.
Washing hands with disinfectant lips is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical wash of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to wash and wash each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper service must be used to close the robin (and open the exit door if appropriate).
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogens (“brothers”) and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
after exposure to blood/to a biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All the bees must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and hands up to the breast, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During the rinsing process, it must be avoided that water on the front arms does not reach the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of the brothers, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of Staphylcocal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved in the first 20% of wash, and that there was only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of washing hands more than 35%.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robins to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, the low washing rate of hands can also be imputable to heavy habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in manual hygiene campaigns to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Hand washing Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural developments.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emejo to illustrate hand washing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing hands is much more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetish fevers called miasmes.
In Germany, for example, exhibitions depicting the "good hand washing techniques" have been placed on the side of the eves in public toilets and in office furniture and airport toilets.
The expression “to wash your hands ” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicated by something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having this kind of thinking are less inclined to deliver themselves to other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as the volunteer.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
and all the thoracic pain must be treated in this way, especially at your age.

'Cause it's the flu season
It should also be stressed that artificial selection can contribute to involuntarily changes in the genes of the virus, which are likely to result in the pressure exerted during the selection, including by the host immune system.
For example, the loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E may be mentioned due to a delegation of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the noise and chamomile viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple nucleotide insertion, which will trigger a decline in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also encouraged by the selective pressure exerted on their reservation guests.
Cases of asymptomatic or moderate symptoms have been detected when noise keys were infected by the CVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CVs and the noise keys.
It seemed that the sound keys were well adapted to the CV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the soybean keys effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CVs.
In addition, the activity of natural harmful cells in the solids is deleted by the receptor’s positive regulation of inhibiting the natural harmful cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low degree of expression of molecules of the major class I Histocompatibilities complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen (DRO) derivatives generated by high metabolic activity of dry keys could both eliminate the replication of the CV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and lead to highly pathogenic viral suctions when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogens of CVs could also develop by recombination, triggering the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, this is not a hazard if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
The CVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to be reserved for such keys and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where they live the secrets of the observation of asymptotic carriers and the cause of severe infections in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivity of immune response and cytokinic shock; the more immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was obtained from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The answer to the interview is particularly strong in the sound keys.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of infection to SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammase is weak in the dry keys.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammase with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the overall scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-COV emerged.
While a beta-Cov of soybeans sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a CV of Souris sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civilians and other animals present on the markets have been detected as carriers of identical viruses at SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-COVs were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate guests or that Pangolin's beta-Cov may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions exist, there is no evidence to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man either voluntarily or accidentally.
The CVs have come under fire because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CVs in raw materials and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCOVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from raw materials and are transmitted to humans by intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civilians present on the markets, the closure of the markets for expensive products and the slaughter of civilians found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, Pangolins should be removed from the market for free products in order to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of many lines of beta-Cov of Pangolin closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by Pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission is produced, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV exists in the miner for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as this has been done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurring MERS epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CVs travel in nature.
In particular, key-sourish CVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no lack of opportunities for these zoonotic CVs to evolve and combine, causing the emergence of more transmissible and/or deadly new CVs in the future.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the threats caused by SRAS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and intervention plan should be put in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity of contamination.
While noise keys present many features that are favourable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of man being in contact with noise keys and other wild species can be minimised if people are sensitive to the need to stay away.
Continue monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of CVs and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoos is to stay away from the ecological networks of natural zoos.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SRAS-CoV-2 are known yet.
Firstly, if the souries transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the Pangolins, it would be interesting to note what conditions the souries and Pangos could share the same ecological nest.
Second, if noise keys play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans get in touch with noise keys.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, sour keys and penguins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it's a sour key, a pangoline or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural guests.
Future research in this area will enhance the evolutional trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "substantial cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick recommendation directive for diagnosis and treatment of new Coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this e-mail, we responded to a comment on our directives and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "support case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Commission for the Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus was designated acute respiratory syndrome to Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO qualified the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team made a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
She has been paying much attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge progress slowly on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Directives published by the National Commission for the Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/) were published in seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially amended.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou and al., presented a simple assessment proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided further evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (test seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspicious case must associate one of the characteristics of epidemiological events with two elements of clinical manifestations in order to constitute a complete analysis, or correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological events:
epidemiological background: (1) a travel or residence incident in Wuhan City and in neighbouring areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) a contact incident with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acid); (3) a contact incident with patients presenting fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City or nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) a prior contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases (with a positive test of nucleic acid); (3) an incident with patients presenting symptoms in the city of Wuhan or in nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the previous class days prior to the appearance of symptoms; (4) a case with a case with a case with a case of CVID19 cases in the case of the disease; 2 cases in pre-types;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imagine showing the characteristics of an infection with COVID-19; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte counts from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on suspects with any of the following elements of pathological or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire viral gene showing a strong homogeneity with the new known coronaviruses; (3) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; or a modification of the specific IgG antibodies of SARS-COV-2 to positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase relative to that appropriate phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear acids in respiratory or blood clotting pathways has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood transfusions was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers to find an optimal kit for the detection of nuclear acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples including the removal of blood, with increased availability of different species, and have contributed to the positive outcome of the specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of the caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou and al. should be updated as they classified people who did not present clinical symptoms such as “low risk”.
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and future studies.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “supports” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in time to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus registers a death record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of registered infected persons included 114 active cases and 33 healers, who were confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport started on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still authorised.
On March 19, these three persons were already repatriated.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobayinin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the siege of the city until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the extension of the 15-day national emergency status; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
The zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe acute respiratory diseases (SRAS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal where HCOV infection could be fatal and potentially fatal.
Most of the HCV come from non-pathogenous keys.
The intermediate reserves of some HCV are also known.
The identification of animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CV-hôte interactions in animals could also help to better understand the CV in humans.
According to differences in protein sequences, the CVs are classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV type contains the majority of HCVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown the role of sour and rounds as genetic sources for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-COV, while birds are the main reserve of gamma-COV and Delta-COV.
To date, seven human coVs (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV includes HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The trace of the zoonotic origins of HCoV offers a framework to understand the natural history, the motor forces and the restrictive factors of the spread of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for preventing future contamination.
Animal CVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCOVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients with a upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to increase in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of classical rhumme, including headaches, nausea, nausea and vomiting, with fever and coughs observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 are both present in the world, and they seem to be mainly transferred in winter, in climate-terminated countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the quantity of toilet paper by purchase
Monday and Saturday evening, Australian stores chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase restrictions on two-to-two toilet paper and a package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the caches and on the channels' Facebook pages.
The buyers apparently gathered reservations for the COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Mercredi, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to a package by order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four purchase packages introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In its press release of 8 March, Cole stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock-breaking at the time following delivery", and qualified the request for "no previous", while ALDI, in a publication on Tuesday Facebook, has qualified it as "expected".
Sales have known a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths speech port.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the shortage, Cole ordered larger packages with suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a planned promotion of Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of detailaries, said that detailaries are trying to increase stocks, but the restrictions of the local council on truck delivery time make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to respond to the demand, with fewer promotions.
Mardi, ALDI announced that after the pre-disposition of stocks, some stores are unable to honor the promotion of mercury.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the department of the distribution of the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores resupply stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a volume-based article, resulting in stockings of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leaves large empty spaces in the radius, strengthening the impression of a pendulum.
“ Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [preserved] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic, ” explained Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The recycled toilet manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were breaking stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleineex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, an real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first trainee when inns in Melbourne, while less than sales in the shops were organized because the buyers were on vacation during the long weekend of the Work Festival.
The edition of NT News, a daily journal printed in Darwin, included an eight-page booklet designed to be printed and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's 3 March report in which they announced that they did not intend to introduce restrictions on purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Also, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization qualifies the COVID-19 pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
Although the word “panedemia” refers only to the extent of spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries fail, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
"We are very concerned, not only by alarming levels of propaganda and severity, but also by alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Control and Prevention Centres, the pandemic is “no previous”.
He stated, in a report published by CNN in February, that “no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued spread at the global level.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never been witnesses of a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "And we have never been witnesses of a pandemic that can be mastered at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WTO decision to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said regarding the epidemic: "To make it short, the situation will end."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a disease epidemic that has been in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The fertility rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Current symptoms include fever, swelling and nausea.
The complications may include acute respiratory depression and pneumonia.
The duration between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be oscillating between two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth, staying away from other people, and monitoring and restricting people suspected of being infected.
The world's authorities have responded by placing restrictions on movements, quarantines, fires, risk controls on workplaces and establishment closures.
The pandemic has created serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the report or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalized damages caused by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and cases of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against the Chinese, others of Asian origin and appearance in the East and South-East, as well as other people who have come from regions with many cases of the virus.
As a result of the decline in the heavy-duty travel and closures in the industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown case of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened early in January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the large sea fruits market in Huanan and it is therefore believed that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered and closely associated virus related to caronaviruses, pangolins, and SARS-CoV. Consequently, it has been found that the first known person with symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and this person had no apparent link with the subsequent feed of the free product market.
In the cases of the first seal reported in December 2019, the two thirds had a link with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be resumed on November 17, 2019, to a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, the WHO noted that, as the new cases seemed to decline in China but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, including those that present positive symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19 years of age and less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population should be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases refer to the number of persons tested at COVID-19 and whose test was confirmed positive under official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who presented only positive symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that in China, up to 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections were not detected and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Control and Prevention Centres concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people who attend the COVID-19 are in charge.
For those who do not recover, the period between the occurrence of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been committed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years old, and 75 per cent were preexisting health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official death accounts related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who have been tested positive for COVID under official protocols.
The number of actual victims of the COVID-19 could be much higher, as it could not include untested persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partly data from Italy show that the mortality figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of deaths of COVID.
A U.S. Control and Prevention Centre spokesman (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotic evaluation reports to the United States. Such an estimate is often carried out in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death out of mainland China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death out of Asia took place in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside Continental China, more than a dozen deaths by country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many indicators are widely used to measure mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and with time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time taken from the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-decession report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the worldwide case-of-decidal report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) by 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the incidence of cases reported decreased by 17.3% (for symptoms reported between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms reported after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the rate of lethargy (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who suffer from a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rate), which represents the percentage of contaminants (diagnostics and non-diagnostics) who suffer from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and are followed by a specific population of disease-related contamination.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the incidence of pandemic infection in its overall population is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this sample is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the tests on the estimates of the fertility rate.
WHO supports that pandemics can be controlled.
The peak and the final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and can vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of the University of state of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then start to regress when the disease becomes unavailable.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen. ”
Chief medical adviser to the Chinese government zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be done since June" if all countries are able to mobilize themselves to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to attract the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circle, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus—because it passes very easily—disappears completely" and that "may become a seasonal disease that can be repaired every year".
The virus of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms are sometimes not specific enough and people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry tissue (68%).
The current symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion (mukositis), osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, muscle and articular pain, back pain, headaches, fever, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea, or cancer. WHO claims that about one person in six is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult revelations, and the face or lips; immediate medical care are recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with results in the test confirming the infection, so researchers have made recommendations that those with close contact with infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
The Chinese assessment of asymptotic ratio varies from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between contamination and appearance of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people wearing the COVID-19 who lost their appetite was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and through good-byes produced by touching, external, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that all without protection can design rubber tiles at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fines that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be designed to be spoken. The respiratory goutlets can also be designed when breathing, especially when speaking, whatever the virus is not usually airported.
Postillons may fall into the mouth or nose of other people on the side or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as incubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (RCP) may cause respiratory secretions that are pulverised and thus cause air dispersion.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that they can pass through the cells, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China excluded the possibility of a féco-ral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days following the start of symptoms, but the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for disease for up to three days before the outbreak of symptoms that suggest that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few signs of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not know exactly how easily the disease spreads, a person is generally infected two to three others, and the virus lasts for hours on the surface.
In particular, the virus could be detected for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after a day on the carton, and for four hours on the cover.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals were tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend that they wash their hands after touching animals, such as after contacting other surfaces that infected people might have been affected.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated from three people who have pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronaviruses that appear in nature. During the human body, the virus is destroyed by the manoeuvre, which is removed from its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be a zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the Betacoronavirus, to the subgene Sarbecovirus (Ling B) associated with two strains of dry keys.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another sample of rabies key virus (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the gene sequences between pangolin and human.
The comparison of the entire gene showed today a maximum of 92 per cent of the common genetic material between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but the final confirmation is carried out by reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase (rRT-PCR) of the infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing the PCR and the scanr in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, because many of its imagery functions coincide with other pneumonies and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner should not be used for depressing or as an initial attempt test for diagnosis of COVID-19".
The WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first break on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood withdrawals.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on rhinopharynx removal but can also be used as a gorg removal. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them appeared sufficiently reliable to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories alone.
The characteristic imagery elements on the radiographs and tomodysitology (scan) of people with symptoms include opacities in asymmetric peripheral depletion and a lack of plural expansion.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently an international online database of confirmed case picture results.
Due to accumulation with other infections such as adenavirus, the unconfirmed imagery by PCR is limited to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of the thoracic scanners to the PCR and showed that if the imagery is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, highlighting its view as a test tool in the areas of the epidemic.
Convulsive neurons based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in the image both on radiographs and scanners.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of disease include overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and touching or permanently in a pig and throwing the pig directly into a powder bag.
It was recommended that those who had already been contaminated carry a public surgical mask.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads into the communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how it has been contaminated, and health professionals are advised that someone who might be infected with the usual precautions and contact precautions, and with the use of protective devices.
The use of localization data by Governments in this regard raised confidentiality problems, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for restrictions on such monitoring.
Several mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of volunteers, and since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on relevant solutions for private life, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other portable phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in contact with someone who has been tested positive to the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulated about how to prevent infection; for example, cutting the nose and loading with the mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in toilets or when the hands are visiblely salted; before eating; and after being moved, touched, or destroyed.
It's because outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the manoeuvre, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based disinfectant containing at least 60% alcohol volume when soap and water are not easily accessible.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, noses, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be detonated in several ways (in a minute of exposure to the disinfectant for an stainless steel surface), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodine povidone 0,2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a facility as an office building or crèche, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, telecoms, and automatic distributors used by sick persons are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their flat cuts or a mollusc when they touch or devour, and to throw all the meat away immediately.
The surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the posterilons designed by speaking, externally, and touching.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at the University of Leeds, "Bringing a mask can reduce people's ability to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of hands."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who are potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended the port of masks to healthy people only if they are at an important risk, for example if they are dealing with a COVID-19 disease, even if it recognized that the port of masks can help people not to touch the face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical masks in fabric. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks for healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or outdoors.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make facial masks and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public exits without mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the port of masks around the world in public places so that everyone would protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government ordered everyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to carry a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced tens of millions of masks every day since the mid-sea, imposed the port of the mask on interurban train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for all exits, while recommending the manufacture of an artificial mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections intended to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closures of schools, workplaces, stations, theaters and commercial centres.
Social distance methods can be applied continuously at home by limiting their journeys, avoiding crowds, by saying hi without contact and by keeping a physical distance with others.
Many Governments now order or recommend social isolation in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by the United States government and health agencies was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 persons, and later to 10 persons.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and other health organizations, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system, were invited by the CDC to stay home as far as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by providing them with physical contact, as often as possible.
The use of the term "social distance" meant that it was necessary to promote total social isolation rather than encourage people to keep contact with other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation not to have sexual relations with anyone with whom we live, who does not have the virus or does not present symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people with positive diagnosis at COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended the establishment of individual quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to the most vulnerable groups.
People who have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to sit in quarantine for 14 days from the time they were exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of an epidemic are the induction or removal, and the attenuation.
The outbreak is introduced during the first stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts will be made to move towards the phase of extinction: measures are taken to slow this spread and to mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Measures to be taken to catch and catch can be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures, in order to focus the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions below 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic consists of trying to catch the epidemic peak: this is what we call the spread of the epidemitic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and provides time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, masks and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; and environmental actions such as cleaning of the surfaces. More drastic measures to play the epidemic have been taken in China since its severity became apparent, such as the introduction of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and localized quarantine missions, and has warned of the movement of persons infected.
Singapore has provided financial support to persons who have been infected in forty years, and has been affected by serious amendments to those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has punished the acquisition of medical supplies. The simulations for Britain and the United States show that attenuation (the slowing but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and removal (reversing the development of the epidemic) pose important challenges.
Optimistic warming policies can reduce the demand for health care of 2/3 and half of deaths, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are undermining.
The removal may be privileged, but must be continued for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), because in the contrary, the transmission is rapidly renewed when the measures are reopened.
Long-term action to eliminate pandemics has a social and economic cost.
There are no prior treatments approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including existing treatments.
Taking medicines without order against smoking or consumption of beverages and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several components that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO stated that some "traditional and artistic remedies" may be affected by the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including the allocation of laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, by canceling emergency interventions where possible, by separating and isolateing patients from COVID-19 positive tests, and by strengthening the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could be resumed on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the market of large sea fruits of Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia feed was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, who informed him of the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SRAS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were punished by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was punished by his superiors for giving warning.
The City Health Commission of Wuhan then published a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities of Wuhan to initiate an investigation early in January. At the first stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the migrations of the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pool as well as a major railway station.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people were killed and more than 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have limited movement and border controls.
National responses included starting measures such as quarantine (also called house-to-house orders, on-site or bordering) and fire cover. On April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were subjected to imprisonment in the United States, with more than 50 million people being confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world knew a form of restraint, a figure rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would be resumed on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown occurrence of pneumonia on 26 December, which she reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CD on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SRAS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have received a warning to have "progressed Roma" about the epidemic.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "explain evidence" of human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" to end the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest establishment in human history”, a health cord was announced on 23 January to stop the journeys since and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.

The United Kingdom's response to the virus was first seen as one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government imposed no social distance or mass-measure against its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its lack of activeness and vitality in response to public concerns.

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and eradication of the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the SRAS epidemic 2002-2004 where Chinese authorities had been accused of dissimulation that had hampered prevention and initiation efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government "has provided regular reports to avoid panic in the wake of the New Year's Moonary.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a movement ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, although it was not a WHO recommendation, it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and spoke of a fact "without precedent in public health history". On 30 January, following the confirmation of an inter-human transmission out of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO stated that the epidemic was a public health emergency in the international press, which was reported to be the U.S.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom stated that the USPPI was responsible for the "risk of global propaganda, particularly for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of movement restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures are ineffective with international trade travel and trade" and "the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movements".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute to an amount of $675 million in order to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent support of those countries that “have no systems necessary to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was on the point of arrival”.

On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to provide international and WHO-based experts in China with support for national management and to assess "the severity and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and by conducting field visits in order to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county level, including urban and rural levels".

This virus may be on your way and you must be ready," adding that good response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan then indicated that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, the WHO stated that coronavirus epidemics could be qualified as pandemics.
The Director-General indicated that the WHO was "exceedingly concerned by alarming levels of propaganda and severity and alarming levels of action." WHO faced important criticisms regarding its management of pandemics, inadequate judgment, particularly because of the late public health emergency and the classification of viruses as pandemics.

Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) have been removed from their functions following their management of the quarantine in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of political officials to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus epidemic.
Some high Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that coronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspirationist theories, claiming that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump qualified the coronavirus of "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that in China "Censored a virus now becoming a global pandemic", which was then taxed by some opposers and was designed to "distort the inability of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast sought a telegram from the U.S. government that exposed the major lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "All came from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including at press and television conferences." Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus were part of a campaign to gain influence at the global level.
EU foreign policy leader Joseph Borrell predicted that there was "a geopolitical component involving a fight for the influence of the rhetorical and gender policy".

Russia also sent a medical aid aircraft to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov stated that “by offering his help to his fellow Americans, [Poutine] is part of the principle that when American manufacturers of equipment and medical equipment have won the speed, they will be able to do the same if necessary.”

The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the year 2020: "In the current public health crisis, he not only endangers the lives of American troops and many European participating countries, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with at least twenty members of Parliament infected, as well as fifteen other former or current political personalities.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for assistance on 14 March 2020 indicating that his country was in a bad condition to combat the epidemic because of lack of access to the United States international markets because of sanctions against Iran. The epidemic caused appeals to the United States to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, a paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the 2020 presidential election. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “ambient and passive efforts” after the latter announced that every person coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
South-Korean society was at the start divided on the response to the crisis of President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be charged with the poor management of the government's epidemic or otherwise in response to its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until the new order, to suspend Parliament and the elections and punish anyone who would have been charged with spreading false information about the virus and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus epidemic has been charged with several cases of supply interruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of the operation of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Medical Products Agency has issued warnings regarding drug and medical injuries due to increased demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of first-needed products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, radios, and pendulums.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the application for individual protection equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This request has led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and has also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also resulted in a reduction in individual protection equipment throughout the world and the WHO warns that it will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Australian producers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a reduction in infant milk in some supermarkets and has subsequently been banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the strong demand for food that followed, these two areas have been separated by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illicit storage and trade in essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding serious food shortages that have been planned in Europe and North America.
As a result of its important agricultural production, Italy in the North did not find a significant reduction, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rations were empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government have broken down porcine reserves to provide sufficient population survival.
Similar laws exist in Italy in order to store reserves for food producers.

The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving important groups have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, and private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass collections, including the prohibited City of Beijing and the ruins of the traditional temple.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the holidays of the New Year until 10 February, imposing in most of the workplaces not to open before this date.
These regions represented 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has gone through its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared a state of emergency, shutting down schools until March and canceling its New Year's festivals. The distribution sector has been affected at the global level, with reduced hours of opening stores or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America have decreased by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a 50 to 60 per cent decline.
This has also resulted in a 33 to 43% decline in peeton traffic in commercial centres in March compared to February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America with regard to a situation without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves locked in internal provinces or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
Coronavirus epidemics could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The restriction in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily salary) to unemployment. Angus Reid Institute survey observed that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900 000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the restriction imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowance, and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies have turned their employees into a partial activity device subsidised by the government called Kurzber.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts sectors of the exhibition and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employees and independent, worldwide.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions have been closed to the new order and their exhibitions, events and reports.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated effects of disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion failures.
The film industry also experienced a interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the Christian period of imprisonment in the Caribbean, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Sunday's Mass; some churches distribute their religious services to radio, online and on-line or television while others propose to practice their religion in "drive-in".
In the wake of the Roman Catholic diocese in Rome who closed his churches and the chapels and the place Saint-Pierre, which was seen by all of his Christian pilgrims, other religious authorities also canceled their services and limited public meetings in the churches, mosques, churches, temples and gu everaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of prayers on Friday in the areas affected by the epidemic and the sacred places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia forbade the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of La Mecque and Médine.
The pandemic has caused the most important interruption of the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events have been cancelled, including the 2019-20 UEFA Championships League, the 2019-20 Football Championship, the Euro 2020 EEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NNH season.
The epidemic disturbed the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which was initially due to begin in late July; the Olympic International Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than 2021". Casinos and other world-wide games facilities have been closed and live poker tournaments have been reported.
This has moved many players to join online, and many online games sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new recordings. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concert tournaments.
Many great theatres, such as those in Broadway, have also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and direct concerts or online "festivals" to make artists produce, disseminate and promote their works.
Online, many Internet games on the topic of coronavirus have been promoted because many prefer humor and distraction to the uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, a collection of prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been found against persons of Chinese and Asian origin, and against persons from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Threats to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Pacific.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in various groups across the world, according to which Chinese merited the virus or received a justified sentence.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians living in the first European country to face a serious COVID-19 epidemic could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have for the first time signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become angry on Twitter.
The Chinese, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported an increase in racist hate levels, as well as aggression.
American President Donald Trump faced the criticism of qualifying the "Chinese virus" coronavirus, a term considered by his tractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked foreign buses transporting Ukrainians and refugees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Indigenous students from the North-East of India, who share a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities would have been subjected to harassment in connection with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Bengal-Occidental Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took his revenge on them".
The notes were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which defines them as "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinans were attracted by the pandemic, foreigners are described as "foreign wastes" that should be "reliefed".
Many access journals have withdrawn them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results with public officials such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory diagnosis of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the ARN of coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the ARN of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including people with symptoms too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of disease and collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
This variable is likely to significantly affect the reported profitability rates, which are likely to be significantly higher in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharingated ecuvilon or inspection sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngous ecuvils is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat while it continues its multiplication in the lungs.
In patients tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by aspiration catheter, or a crack (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 through a reverse transcription followed by a real-time real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR) and was the basis of 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2-based clinical quality kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the “E” gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the authorisation of the Chinese National Administration of Medicinal Products for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnosis by RT-PCR in real time of the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories via the International Ressource.
Among the ancient versions of test kits, a genetic test of three was obtained inconclusive results due to defective reactions, as well as an extraordinary test goulot in the Atlanta CDC. Thus, a average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and that is only when federal and local laboratories received permission to start the investigation.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre in virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was announced that an infection detection test had been developed at COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA authorization for a test that could be carried out in large quantities at 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests at 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency authorisation (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hlólic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an U.S.A. from the FDA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermal isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify production to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibodies specifically related to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is under development in Taiwan, hoping that it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as a quick flu test.
One March 2020 bibliographic study concluded that “pulmonary radiographs present a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodedensytometry] can be concluded even before symptoms appear. ”
Among the typical symptoms visible on the TDM are oscillations in multi-lobar bilateral depletion with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
A sub-pleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation develops as the disease develops.
A study comparing PCR to Wughan TDM, at the source of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is more sensitive than PCR, though more precise, to several of its imagery results consistent with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. Radiology College recommends that "TDM should not be used for testing or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19".In March 2020, CDCs recommend PCR for initial testing.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and in the monitoring of the population.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLC) or by test at the patient’s head (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-debt systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the TLC, one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For the PCT, one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, no stage of extraction is required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities who were duly informed of the agency and can therefore now distribute their anti-corporate testing tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.In March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitype Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
The antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the beginning of the infection.In April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits for antibodies purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan in which suspects can remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients who fear inside, send it back and receive the test results later.The British NHS announced that it will launch a pilot project to test suspects at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient does not harm others by getting into a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the case of the COVID-19 suspects, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The “drive” centres enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most exciting tests in the world.In Germany, the National Medical Association of compulsory health insurance announced on 2 March that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in an ambulance, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by sickness insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19th, test drives were available in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of 483,295 samples were tested to the week 12/2020 including 33 491 samples (6.9 %) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, technical researchers and Rambam hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients both, grouping the samples and not doing the test if the sample was combined with positive. In Wuhan, an unprovable laboratory for detection of 2,000 square meters (6.9 per cent) called "Huo-Yan" (in Israel) was developed and tested using a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at once.
Due to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modelization revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of the installation in quarantine would have doubled without such detection capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities in total.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity rose to 50,000 tests per day.The multi-plex free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for the COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without liquid-handling robots.
In March, minors and insufficient reactive amounts became an extraordinary hole for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has prompted some authors to consider sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genes to continue testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the Arab Emirates were now the largest part of their population per capita for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been obtained through a combination of the ability to drive and purchase a high-cost laboratory with Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to run tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first laboratory to be operational outside China.
Various test formulas targeting different parts of the gene profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for producing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources needed to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations of health experts.
Instead, specialists indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
The deployment capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of research programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for tests leading to the wide spread of the virus has led to the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States' private laboratories, and the reserves of ecuvillons and chemical reactions have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC were "debts". The government then removed bureaucratic barriers that hampered private tests.Spain bought test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the kits that had given the wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic produced false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits that were missing in China.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be cast into the Danube. Atesh Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were useless.
The survey, followed by forty of those who obtained positive results and the traceability of people who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the place of the first death associated with the COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of approximately 3,400 people, at about ten days of interval.
Nearly half of those receiving a positive outcome did not have symptoms, and all cases were detected in quarantine.
With the restrictions on movement in the community, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracking of contacts, the restrictions on entry travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail sales facilities.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay with them on March 28, but schools have broken to the date scheduled for the end of the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries that have performed most of the tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower levels of loyalty, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and national laboratories have only a limited experience of COVID-19 sending their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to carry out confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the 'Positive in % of tests' column depends on the national testing policy.
A country that does not test that people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of higher tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors are the same.
The washing of hands, also called hygienic of hands, consists of cleaning hands in order to remove salts, fats, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by an oro-focal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhum, for example, by preventing the hands from touching your eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key points of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning the steps of a baby or changing its legs, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling of meat, fish or crustaceans.
If you do not have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in the oven. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after preparation of meals;
before and after the appointment of a sick person;
after changing the legs of a baby or cleaning a child who is attached to toilets;
after being moved or pushed/unseen;
after touching an animal, feed for animals or waste of animal origin;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or producing medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people handling food or working in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reduction in the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of respiratory infections; and reduction of respiratory infections;
and the reduction of infant mortality rates at home.
According to a study carried out in 2013, improving manual hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea may be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in the soap.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
The implementation of actions to promote hand washing could reduce approximately one third of the diarrhoea episodes, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands to the soap allows a 48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that must be done automatically in the homes, schools and communities around the world.
The pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of death among children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing almost half the deaths from diarrhoea and one quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health measures in water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Small hand washing can cover the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could result from excemism or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and dementia, and particularly frequent in health workers.
The excessive washing of hands is also considered to be one of the symptoms of the complex obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key times a day to reduce the air-focal transmission of diseases: before and after using toilets (mixing, defecation), after cleaning a baby's feet (or changing its legs), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling of meat, fish or crustacean birds.
It is also necessary to wash your hands properly in order to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after taking care of a wound or wound, after being injured, injured or moved, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, the rate of clean-up hands in soap is low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 in 54 countries and taking on the hygiene of hands, 38.7% of the average households were washing hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that in Saudi Arabia the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China showed the lowest rate (23%). Today there are several methods to develop behaviors and democratize the use of soap for washing hands at key times of the day. It is particularly visible in developing countries to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a primary health care programme to promote the health and education of children.
The elimination twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands to the soap and brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothbrush, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the micro-organisms present on the skin, it is necessary to add soaps or water-stainers.
The main action of experts and researchers is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleaner given that lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to solve in the water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
The solid sand, due to its reusable nature, can recover bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were mixed with the mouse.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable".
Antibacterial knowledge has been strongly recommended to those concerned with their health status.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antibiotics or recommended disinfectants allows the target of antibiotics resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial knowledge contains current antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have many resistant organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotics resistant strains are not the product of antibacterial knowledge, these latter may not be as effective as announced.
The most complex formulas may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) which are used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menhol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the public health school of the University of Oregon indicated that ordinary knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate manicures.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, cold water and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural salts and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of hot water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-acoustic hands hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (now called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to popularize.
Most are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with an exacerbating agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a freezingr such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or mussel for a greater ease of use and reduce the effects of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol effectively eliminate the germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERW), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as champagne.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.The disinfectants for the hands are more effective against the bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to well swallow or cover both hands.
The paume and two of both hands, as well as the interstitials between the fingers and the angles for about 30 seconds, should be dealt with until liquid, muscle or dry gel.
The American Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visiblely salted.
The increased use of these products has led to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace an adequate washing of hands unless you have no water and sufficient washing.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emulsifiers and/or skin hydrating agents.
The alcohol sensitizer can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial swabs or detectors.
The dermatitis of allergic contact, contact urticaria or hypersensitive to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, products not those products do not eliminate the organic material present on the hands, but only to disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogen agents, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formula used in benzalkonium chloride has presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin discomfort.
In low income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use more than the land or land.
The earth or the earth can be more efficient than the water alone, but less than they know.
In addition, if soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of cold.
At the end of the shower, the sink is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends the burial or sand as an alternative to the sand when it is not available.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands properly to prevent transmission of diseases, following the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of the boiling water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to differ).
To move a generous amount of soap on their hands by chasing each other, without forgetting the two hands, between the fingers and under the angles.
The soap removes the skins of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than water alone.
Flotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of fracter creates friction, which helps to eliminate the wounds of the skin, and to freeze longer times remove more breasts.
Swimming enough to the current water.
Retaliation in a steaming water pool can lead to hand retamination.
Seat with a free or private service.
The most often forgotten areas are the dust, the poignant, the area between the fingertips and the bottom of the angles.
Artificial angles and vertebrate angles can be hosted by microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when robin water and/or soap are not available. For example, to warm up water from a bitwood or a suspended and dry soil and/or use it to cook if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as typpy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a cord, and a pedal that allows a small amount of water to be poured on the hands and a soap bread.
The effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper services are much more hygienic than electrical dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the whole paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper services, hot air dryers and hot air dryers.
After washing and drying hands in hot air drying, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by 194 per cent on the lungs and 254 per cent on the lungs.
The drying in the air by jet resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the dust drop of 42% and on the ground floor of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper service, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76 per cent on the lung and up to 77 per cent on the lungs.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other users of toilets and the environment of toilets based on each drying method.
The air-conditioning dryer, which breathes from the air out of the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of disposing of hand and device micro-organisms and potentially contamination of other toilet users, as well as the environment of toilets in a perimetre up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air dryer allows the spread of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper services have revealed that there was no significant promotion of micro-organisms. In a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated in 2005.
After hand drying, the following variations of the bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different hand mill manufacturers, and hand mills have been compared to drying using paper services.
Washing hands with disinfectant lips is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study revealed that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical wash of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to wash and wash each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In the case of residuals under the angles, it is possible to use a dust brush to remove them.
As the brothers present in the water are likely to stay on their hands, it is important to wash well and wash with a clean service.
After drying, the paper service must be used to close the robin (and open the exit door if appropriate).
This helps to prevent the retracing of the hands in contact with the surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogens (“brothers”) and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical establishments, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which contributes to the transmission of micro-organisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catalytic blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and washing hands in the field of health.
The draft manual on the hygiene of the hands established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
Devices available in trade may measure and certify the hygiene of hands if compliance with the regulation is observed.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" relating to the hygiene of hands:
after exposure to blood/to a biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after contact with the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (such as "medical" or "antimicrobials") to the washing agent seeks to destroy the germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotics resistant organisms are very scarce. To "frott" their hands for surgical surgery, it is necessary to have a robin that can be opened and closed without touching the hands, a product of chlorohexidine or iodine-based washing, sterile services to dry their hands after having washed them, a sterile brush to chew themselves and another sterile instrument to clean under the angles.
All the bees must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and hands up to the breast, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't need to shake your hands for 10 minutes.
During the rinsing process, it must be avoided that water on the front arms does not reach the hands.
Once the hands are washed, the hands should be washed using a sterile line and a surgical cassette.
In order to reduce the spread of the brothers, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of Staphylcocal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved in the first 20% of wash, and that there was only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of washing hands more than 35%.
If you compare the washing of hands done with an ordinary shower with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Also, by comparing the washing of hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average period of 30 seconds each, it is found that the first reduces the bacterial contamination of 26 per cent per second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and difficult Clostridium tracers present on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible to train personnel to wash their hands, to make more alcohol-based products available and to address written and verbal reminders on this subject.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap washing is considered to be a small cost-effective and essential tool for maintaining health, to be properly fed.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soaps or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robins to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, the low washing rate of hands can also be imputable to heavy habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of soap washing and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, make known the benefits associated with this practice and bring about a long-term change in behaviour among the population.
In order to achieve this objective, follow-up and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective to increase the rate of hand washing in low-income and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting hand washing in schools, the example of the UNICEF 's three-star approach, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, despite other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in manual hygiene campaigns to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Hand washing Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural developments.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emejo to illustrate hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness report of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy life (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing hands is much more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers coming to the hospital or wounded soldiers, was identified for the first time in the mid-19th century by two pioneers in the hygiene of the hands: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of Modern Nurses" in Britain.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetish fevers called miasmes.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and noccommodal infections have led the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively the hygiene of hands as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The appearance of porcine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, exhibitions depicting the "good hand washing techniques" have been placed on the side of the eves in public toilets and in office furniture and airport toilets.
The expression “to wash your hands ” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicated by something.
It is derived from a Bible verse by Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washes the hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has been widely distributed in some English communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in a more energetic way to try to clean up an imaginary task, a symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and that she urged her husband to commit.
It has also been observed that some people, after being remembered for having committed acts contrary to ethics or having intended to do so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having this kind of thinking are less inclined to deliver themselves to other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as the volunteer.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the washing rituals of hands first placed in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, the immersion (tevilah) and the ritual abolition of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianity and the Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygiene purposes, particularly after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash their hands after going to toilets.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace identify the implementation of working health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls on the workplace vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of workers that may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk employment has a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic anti-infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are ill, respiratory label, and maintaining a clean and routine of the working environment.
Average exposure risk employment covers those who need frequent or close contacts with persons without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected because of an ongoing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, as well as basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, hygiene vitae and the provision of an individual protection equipment in case of encountering an infected person with COVID-19.
The OCHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known COVID-19 as having a high exposure risk, which are at very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or removals or manipulations of samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
The COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they are sick, have to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both in terms of goods and means of purchasing them (i.e. making their courses out of time or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the dispatch of articles from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community-related risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also seek the necessary controls to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may result from the epidemics.
The preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations and reducing the adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the undertaking is located affects the answers applied.
The hierarchy of risk control forms a global framework for health and safety at work in order to integrate risk controls effectively.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, administrative controls and individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers, and they can be the most economic solution to implement them.
Administrative controls refer to changes in employment policies or procedures that require action by the employer or employer.
The individual protection equipment (IPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of IPOs must be selected according to the risk for the worker, correctly adapted according to the needs (e.g. breathing masks), properly and systematically carried, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced by the needs, and correctly withdrawn, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid any contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk employment has a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and minute hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, breathing label, including covering the mouth and nose to swallow and swallow, providing infants and villages, preparing the television or working hours that are needed, encouraging workers to use the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining the cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees who are presenting symptoms of respiratory disease should stay at home until they are no longer fever, fever signs or any other symptoms from at least 24 hours without using fever or other symptoms; they also recommend applying flexible disease leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member and to inform employees of these policies.
According to OCHA, jobs at risk of average exposure include those who require frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m) of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected by SARS-COV-2 because of a Community transmission running around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international journey in a region with a COVID-19 broadcast.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density working environments, and some high-voltage retailing environments. Technical controls for this group and those at the highest risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic windows and the installation of a smoke window for the customer. Administrative controls for this group and those at the highest risk of the promotion of the work force, the replacement of high-risk workers at home, the replacement of meetings with high-risk and high-risk water filters, and the increase of natural air quality, the installation of ventilation, the installation of ventilation and ventilation systems, the installation of physical ventilation systems, the installation of physical barriers, the installation of physical barriers, the installation of plastics and the installation of high-performing facilities, the installation of high-performal systems and the installation of high-performal systems for the safety of the safety of the safety and safety of the safety of the safety of the safety window.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick on board a plane, appropriate controls for the protection of workers and other passengers include the following measures: to separate the disease from others by a distance of 6 feet, to designate a member of the crew to deal with the disease and to offer a mask of protection to the patient or to ask him to cover his mouth and nose with the aid of infants when he or she is sick.
The cabin crew must carry stable medical gloves when it is occupied by a sick passenger or touches organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the patient is exposed to fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
The gloves and other spare parts must be taken into a bag for dangerous biological wastes and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected accordingly. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the report of the journey in the event of disease, as well as auto-insulation and immediate information from the medical centre if it develops a fever or other symptoms once on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring must take place in the home of the isolated person. For school and child care facilities, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has become in a school building, regardless of community propaganda.
In the case of moderate minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of pedagogical exits, assemblies and other important collections such as physical education courses or coral reefs or canteen meals, increasing space between offices, reducing hours of arrival and exit, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate nurse for children with flu symptoms.
In the case of major transmissions in the local community, as well as social distance strategies, an extension of school vacations may be considered. For the forces of the order that perform routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
Officials of the order forces who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of an adequate individual protection equipment.
In the event of close contact during a arrest, workers must clean up and disinfect their equipment and service station before re-use using a liquefied tongue or spray to maintain and follow the standard procedures for the use of IPOs, as well as the cleaning and washing of clothing.
OCHA considers some health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become very high-risk exposure workers if they conduct procedures producing aerosols or removals or handling samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Procedures producing aerosols include induction, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental examinations and procedures or invasive removal of samples.
High-risk exposures include workers who are involved in the preparation of bodies with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they are at a very high risk of exposure if they practice an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolate rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when conducting aerosol-producing procedures.
A specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
Samples must be manipulated using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients enter separate waiting rooms depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other IPI, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons working at least 6 feet of patients with suspected or known infection by SARS-COV-2 and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or superior must be used in the context of a full and written respiratory protection programme, including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide higher protection and better comfort to the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
The WHO recommends the port of a surgical mask only by the entrance testing staff.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective lenses or facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given the insufficient global supply of EPI, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a location occupied by a patient COVID-19 to those directly involved in its care, the use of the EPIs required for the specific task alone, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without withdrawing it for the treatment of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the EPI supply chain and the dissuasation of the use of masks for sufferable individuals.

We find this month in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response depends on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and kindness that we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud of you all to count among my colleagues.
Last week, someone gave me his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol is the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible through your work, which keeps you operating sites, ensures the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
It is a moment when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will proceed to the subsequent adjustments in the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our work of time
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our time employment in the days and months to come.
During this discussion, we have considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the organization's viability during this period.
First, we have to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take the rest, don't worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily work time target will be approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until the new order.
We will not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the present time, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, run courses or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say it.
No sickness stop or cancel payment required: simply prevent your superior and help your team review the schedules and time jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are positively diagnosed at COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the department T&amp;C Ops for T&amp;C to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention of the management).
Time staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced it, and we will renew our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our fellow employees and staff members.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his usual working hours carried out under normal conditions.
That's true if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a means to relieve their stress in the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly grateful, especially in periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and how to take the necessary provisions.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Trust &amp; Security and Fund Collection (including others) teams carry out essential work that may need to be strengthened.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There's enough work for each of us, we're just going to focus on the most important projects.
Relaxing now won't do any harm later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to save time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to make additional hours to respect the deadlines now unrealistic.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new goals and opportunities where appropriate.
What about the PPP (Annual Planning) ?
In order to adapt us to our new reality and to our daily working time goals, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which requires more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, care for themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or wish to see their working time reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of the stages considerably reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps of confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with extra caution, we have called for an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They used a hospital-quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our stage.
The building has used its own protocol of duty to use products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork area, which has shared with us and all staff members based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York knew, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continued but could be updated.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our colleagues who used to be away from work realized that adaptation could be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings at meetings at a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider distributing them for several days.
Set the meeting clearly, have a agenda and send documentation ahead.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage direct collaboration and exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable cache.
Use your well-being refund for collatings.
Join the channel #remotes on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team studies ergonomic guidelines based on web-based web-based guidelines to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimédia, such as the edition-a-thon, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We have explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
The next week, we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad to the confusion and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikipedia and others.
As a result, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and to continue our communication with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for an extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday staff, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us, and we are here to help you in any way.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with members of staff living in countries currently severely affected.
If you have questions about movements, events, important workflows or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support and secure the connection if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to Brian Juden, Director of the International Global Operations RH.
None of these changes should be considered a waste of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it should be recognized that at present, our work and our obligations will probably need to be adapted in an unprecedented manner.
These are the steps that we consider necessary to support each other and to continue our work, to provide the help that we need, and to provide the service that everyone can count on.
Our work will be there to wait for the time has come.
For the moment, it is time to get up and prepare for the important work that will take place in the weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, so you need to keep and take care of your family so that you can give the best of your own time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is an enzyme associated with the external face (cellular membranes) of lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
The ACE2 is opposed to the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and by increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising medical target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 area of peptidase at terminal N and an area of a transporter area of renal amino acid at terminal C.
ACE2 is a unique type I membrane protein, whose active area on the enzyme level is exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular area is cut from the transmembrane area by another enzyme called Sheddase; the solvent that results is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related mainly to the cell membrane of type II lung cells, vertebral intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and the blood cells of most organs.
The expression of ARNm of ACE2 is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain trunk.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE releases angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictr.
The ACE2 is responsible for phenylamine amino acid in angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also detect several other peptides including [des-Arg9] bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and graine.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the AMA-neutral ACE carrier and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus of the SRAS) ; and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus of the origin of the COVID-19).
More specifically, the link of S1 protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzymes on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and in both transfer of the virus and enzyme in endosomals within cells.
This process of entry also requires the introduction of protein S by the host protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of this latter is currently being carried out as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help to fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended that the standard treatment be continued with the assistance of the ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ECE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to witness subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular AVC victims and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less profound than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Angiotensin 2-recombinant human enzyme (rhACE2) is present as innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the porcelains with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes plus 24 hours of effect.
Several conclusions suggested that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for people who are intolerant to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (SRA) or for patients with high angiotensin II circulation. rhACE2 under infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the trace of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons likely to be in contact with an infected individual.
Several applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the tracking of the geographical location of users of applications, raise questions about respect for private life.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the presence of a user with other portable phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems with a functionality that enables them to handle these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Acholia, has launched an application in China that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with COVID-19 porters.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, as far as it is concerned, chosen for a app named TraceTogether.
Having been developed by a local community of informants, it was provided with an open source and will be returned to the Government. The North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!" a Bluetooth application that ensures the trace of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with the health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was pending approval by Google Play Store and App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed over the next few weeks. A similar application was planned in Ireland and France (‘StopCovid’).
Australia and New Zealand intend to put in place applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geosurgery application for patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentioned several practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including positive errors and lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the promotion of false or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple only allows “official” or generally worthy trust agencies to add applications related to Coronavirus to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Soldiers for the protection of private life have been concerned about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass monitoring, in particular the possible maintenance of the surveillance infrastructure created to face the Coronavirus pandemic once and for all.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations have provided eight conditions for compliance with government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extension of control and surveillance should include closure clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19 ;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the Act;
Protections should be provided for against abuses and remedies for citizens in cases of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "participating parties concerned" would be mandatory, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Without Border Reporting (Reporter Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published verification lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the continued monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as long as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid traceability.
In Israel, network traffic has been approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geocalization data present important potential problems in respect of private life.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need to access personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for inter-communication, thus ensuring respect for private life (see below).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application has been used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including data on tracking of mobile devices and transactions by card, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the Government has also made information on the location available to the public, which has been authorised following the profound changes to the privacy of information protection laws following the MERS epidemic that have affected this country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralised systems for private life.
Details have not yet been reported on 6 April 2020.
The trace of contacts with respect to private life is a well-established concept, consisting of a large volume of research data from 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on solutions for private life, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other portable phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that is associated with centralised and decentralised approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralised Privacy-Conserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, previously called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data will never leave the device and that all matching tasks will be carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of private life conservation techniques in the collection and use of location or contact data to follow the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private life protection technologies initially based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure material technologies to enable users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and basically equivalent protocols, with a view to reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communication tracking initiative, stating that it would enable it to maintain private life and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology with a cryptography that ensures confidentiality.
They also published the specifications of basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official applications for Coronavirus traction in respect of private life
Direct integration of this functionality in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to address the problems of the adoption of the solution and the persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through upgrades of the operating system and by removing it further in the same way once the threat is removed.
Reposition of a medicine (also called reorientation, reprofilation, re-affection or change in therapeutic indication of a medicine) refers to the conversion of a medicine approved for a disease or for a different medical condition for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research agency currently under study to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research activities include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfer of plasma by convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 presents approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several links.
The analysis of these links offers the real development project of an effective antiviral medicine against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the Papain-type protein, the ARN polymerase ARN dependent, the helicase, S protein and ADP phosphatase.
Hussein A A, and al. studied several candidates who were then optimised and analysed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicine in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the apparent chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four drugs studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State tests on chlorquin and hydrochloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquine sulphate and chlorquin phosphate under an emergency authorisation (USA).

It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procrastinate.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit has been observed”.
These medicines have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV related to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these medicines to find a component that is related to SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
The dementesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences such as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that it had an in vitro antiviral activity against several filviruses, pneumonia, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more disease and transmission.
Some pre-tested studies suggest that reddesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by Cleveland university hospitals; one bringing on people who suffer from moderate pathology and the other on those who are more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).

Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
The low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which motivates the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have concentrated on the recovery of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for prior epidemics such as MERS, SRAS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many development attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, virus of the origin of the disease, at least 18 months ago.
In April, five vaccine candidates were conducting phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been reported worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genes published to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the introduction of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms held research and development projects in early 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform carried out in phase I safety studies include:
Nuclear acid (DN and ARN) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As reported by ECI scientists in April, 115 vaccine candidates totalled at the first stages of development, 78 (79 after the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with little public information available (presumed during planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres all, determining more accurate doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a group of witnesses, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in the prevention of disease, while monitoring the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development (conferencing April 2020), 74 were not in the human person assessment phase (preclinical research) yet.

The vaccine candidate is in the laboratory, the testing on human beings is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that American President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong amounts of money to obtain exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which led to the protest of the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for joint development of an ARNm vaccine.
The vaccine candidate based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinical test phase with the start of the expected clinical trials in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of its final vaccine candidate could begin at automune.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in the Preparation of Epidemics (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a fund for the research of a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing ECPI's total investment in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$ 29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novamax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started tests on the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifier vaccine against COVID-19.

On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stated that “the SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits administered by microaguillas started an important response from the anti-antigenic antibodies [in rats] observed 2 weeks after immunization”.
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a vaccine candidate based on DNA in the potential form of a nasal spray.
With bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to reproduce in human bacteria to produce non-violence particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud-based IT resources.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can provide benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another survey conducted in Australia includes 4, 170 health professionals.
It is possible that developing vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using specific animal models at COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 rats, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates the need to implement biosafety control measures at level 3 for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protection vaccine against SRAS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for the governments and health agencies of the world.There is no vaccine tested against MSRS.
When the MERS were involved, it was thought that existing research on SRAS could be used as a model for the development of vaccines and medicines against an infection with MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a single anti-MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were ongoing; all vaccines were viral vector, two adneviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have published a theory of the compost that the virus from the origin of the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various publications of social networks refer to existing patents bearing genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms include fever, swelling and nausea.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, stomach pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The duration between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be oscillating between two to fourteen days.
While most cases of moderate symptoms occur, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organs failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been cured. The virus is spread mainly during close contact, often by gouttelettes produced by touching, outdoor or speaking.
These gouts are produced in the air, usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than represent a long-range risk of infection.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days following the occurrence of symptoms, although the infection is possible prior to the occurrence of symptoms and during the subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the port of the mask by the public generally vary, some authorities recommend their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, vomiting.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips; it is advised to consult a doctor immediately in the presence of these symptoms.
More often than not, respiratory symptoms such as ovulation, nasal excretion or back pain may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China have initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of non-symptomatic people is currently unknown and in the study. The Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Commission for Health began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; of 166 infections reported on this day, 130 (78 per cent) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Exploration and discharge can both carry important viral loads.
The fact that you speak more freely than you normally do.
A study in Singapore revealed that all without protection can design goutlets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors in the outer color of the patient's rooms produced positive samples to the viral ARN.
Some medical procedures such as incubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (RCP) may disseminating respiratory secrets and thus cause air dispersion.
Although there are concerns about a spread by the cells, this risk is understood to be low. The virus is the most contagious when people experience symptoms; although propaganda may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not know exactly how easily the disease spreads, a person is generally infected two to three others, and the virus lasts for hours on the surface.
In particular, the virus could be detected for one day on the carton, for three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (ISI 304) and for four hours on the cover at 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and solvents are also effective if used properly; the soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which disables and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salt samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five patients in six, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronary virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the outbreak of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus appearing in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic snake, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is a close parent of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by the COVID-19 because the virus reaches host cells via angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in allveolable cells of type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to connect to ACE 2 and penetrate into the host cell.
Acute heart attacks have been reported in 12 per cent of those admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system problems during the progression of the disease, however acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ECE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) have been observed in patients with COVID-19 intensive care and can be associated with an adverse forecast.
While SARS-COV-2 presents a trophisme for the epithelial cells of respiratory pathways expressing ECE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 experience systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
These are particularly secretive T cells of GM-CSF which have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngate removal; however, nasal removal or inspection may also be used.
In general, results are available within a few hours, up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks of interval and the results are of low immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a coronavirus strain and have published the genetic sequence that laboratories around the world have developed independently of chain polymerization response tests (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, anti-corporate tests (probably detectable of active infections and prior infection of a person) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test to be used by the patient on 21 March 2020 at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines published by zhongnan University Hospital of Wuhan suggest methods of detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multiple-lobber bilateral depletion with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution is typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Plenary Dominance, crazi paving (interlobular septal advantage with variable alveoliary concentration) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on COVID-19 pathophysyology.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopic: Plenary, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, prolonged atypical pneumocytitis, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multinucleus gene formation
severe pneumonia: diffusive alveoliary damage (DAD) with diffusive alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
gastric pneumonium: organization of exudates in interstitial alveolary cavities and pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation disseminated (CIVD) ; leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding cold places, washing hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a muscle when it is crushed or continuous and using the inside of the chest in the absence of the muscle.
A proper hand hygiene after touching or shaking is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with a fabric in public places, with a view to limiting transmission in case of symptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact of persons infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacements and canceling important groups of people.
The distance directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known medicine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine has not been expected before 2021 at any time, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is attempting to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "spleting the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in toilets or when the hands are visiblely salted; before eating; and after moving, touching, or drying.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for trade hands are not available, WHO proposes two forms for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacteria spores in alcohol, which is not “a antiseptic active substance for hands”.
Glycerol is added as amusing.
People are treated with support care that may include hydrotherapy, oxygen therapy and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of carrying the virus carry a simple facial mask.
The extra-body oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure cases, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a way of life and healthy nutrition have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people for COVID-19.
Renewable and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamineopene) instead of ibuprofen in the first line.
Warnings should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly under care conditions where procedures can generate aerosols, such as incubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals who are suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an insulation room adapted to air infection (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of individual protection equipment (IPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blue, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the respiratory masks are privileged (for facial masks).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unlisted uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens or, in the last resort, artificial masks.
The majority of cases of COVID-19 are not strong enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases in the east.
The type of respiratory assistance for people suffering from respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalised people. Some evidence indicates that incubation can be avoided by using a high-debt nasal channel or a positive pressure of double-level respiratory pathways.
We do not know whether one or both earn the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to keep invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles relative to high-debt nasal channel. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the capacity of the care system to treat a small Sudanese number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance, and 1.4% were killed.
In China, about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices that offer high pressure control modes and a high PEP are necessary to optimise the release of oxygen and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumonia.
The high PEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatment to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are the subject of clinical trials.
It seems to be the most promising one.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several testing drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in potential treatment efficacy and safety tests, and the FDA has granted temporary authorization to plasma convalescents as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. The analysis of mass data from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phones location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and those with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data from persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The aim was to ensure respect for the quarantine and protection of persons who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect the quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Minister for Health Giulia Gallera has been reported by mobile telephone operators that “40 per cent of people continue to move.”
The German government held a 48-hour Hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, displacement restrictions, side effects of treatment or the fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying that "an increasing social isolation, solidarity, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect stumbling block to the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may have a mild or non-sympathetic evolution, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as rhum.
The moderate cases are generally re-assembled in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
pregnant women may pose a higher risk of severe infection to COVID-19 according to the data from similar viruses, such as SRAS and MERS, but there is no data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress to develop into a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-viscera failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, problems with coagulation and heart, kidney and liver injury.
Coagulation problems, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases treated with COVID-19, and renal failure was observed in 4% of the population.
Some 20 to 30 per cent of COVID-19 people have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminants).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in hospitalization.
However, patients with intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total of six to 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men presented a mortality rate of 2.8% while women presented a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present a widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudations in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytitis.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
At 11.8 per cent of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Commission on Health, heart attacks due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest have been observed.
According to U.S. March data, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had preexisting pathologies, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region could also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The low number of moderate cases may result in a death rate overestimation.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previous contracts may indicate that the current rate of death is being underestimated.
Smoking was 1.4 times more prone to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and poses a 2.4 times higher risk of intensive care or death compared to non-smokers. Concerns are also expressed in relation to long-term cycles of the disease.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong observed a drop of 20 to 30 per cent in respiratory capacity in some disease-treated people, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intense post-giersonian illness.
In March 2020, it was ignored whether an earlier infection had an effective long-term immunity in people treated with the disease.
Immunities are probably considered to be based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 treating people following positive tests of coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and animal origin, by spreading infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of infection was almost exclusively caused by a human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed that the most recent date of symptoms occurred on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to evaluate mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and in time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time taken from the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health.
By the end of 2019, WHO has affected the pathological emergency codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed deaths in the SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 diagnosed deaths from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection to SARS-COV-2 confirmed in the laboratory. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time range.
According to the statistics at Johns-Hopkins University, the worldwide death/cas report is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240,191) until 17 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region. Other measures include the rate of fatality (CFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who suffer from disease and the rate of infectious lethargy (IRF) who reflect the percentage of people who are infected (diagnosed or not) who are suffering from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and are followed by a specific population of disease-related contamination.
Although not all infected persons develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and in young people, it will change a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths associated with COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people can have antibodies, according to a blood donors assessment.
69 deaths (0,004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates are different in men and women.
Death is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk is among 50 men, the difference between men and women who only disappear at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The specific reasons for this difference between sex are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be involved.
The immunological differences in sex, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidity such as hypertension at a lower age than in women could have contributed to a higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected individuals were men and 72 per cent of the COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not collect the data associated with COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS are affecting different men and women.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nurses, are women and pose an increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with the recommendations of the international nomenclature to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and " Wuhan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the names of chronic disease 2019-nCov and respiratory disease as well as 2019-nCOV for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Taking into account the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care materials such as ecuuvilons and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the supplier could not provide it at any time, a local start was delayed and printed the 100 valves required at night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, complex theories, false information and misinformation have emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and have spread rapidly.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find viral replication evidence in pigs, canards and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "the SOLIDARITY trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral components presenting the most promising effectiveness.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are developing active vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use both ACE 2 receptors to paint in human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are the subject of research.
First, researchers are trying to create a vaccine for all viruses.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims at creating a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on protein S to the spinal cord that helps the virus to filter into the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nuclear acid-based vaccines (absorption by DNA or ARN, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an indefensive genetic code copied on the virus causing the disease. The dependent activity of the antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing.
Seven studies have assessed previously approved treatments against palulism, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reversible antiviral drugs are the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials in phase III on reddishvir in several countries where reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of vaccine candidates and medications against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including reddesivir, clloroquin and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of redisciprative in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with undecidive use.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, some request an independent analysis of research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquinine.
However, Wuhan’s virology institution, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydrochloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency authorisation for the use of physicians on the discretion of patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for the follow-up of an in vivo study following a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein starting with serum transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ECE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azathromycin show major limits that prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without additional studies. Ostelamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not play a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic anti-choc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
There is an ongoing phase 2 test that has not been randomized at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people who have a severe form of disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify the cytokinic shock, it must be opposed to such developments that are suspected to be the origin of the death of some affected individuals.
Interleukine-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractional cytokines in steroids caused by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective SCR treatment.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of people with COVID-19 cures to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SRAS with little final results.
Viral neutralisation is the mode of action expected by which passive anti-corporate treatment can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as the cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other passive antibiotics, such as monoclonal antibodies produced, are being developed.
The production of serums from the liquid part of the blood of war patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, subsequently contracted COVID-19 and died after paying attention to the spread of the virus.
