Tampere's 9-year-old son was found
The police have had to search for a 9-year-old boy because of his arrests at Tampere on Tuesday night.
The report on the disappearance of a boy from West Tampere has been published in the social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no risk to life and health.
The boy's father told the night-sanom that he had found the boy.
He's all right, and now we're going to start the follow-up.
The boy found the house next door, Dad told me.
Ronaldo resuscitate - repi meal in the Messiah
Cristian Ronaldo had five lands over Spain for a week and continued to work in the Mestres.
The link between Lionel Messin and Christian Ronaldo from the Mesterian overseas became at least a few minutes’ noticeable progress.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the bottom of all the ages of the painting industry when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetskin into the network of two shootings and one game scene.
Ronaldo was in his 80 ’ s when he was in his 80 ’ s when he was on vacation with him in Barcelona Messil, where there are 77 pieces.
Real won the prize 4-0.
Juventus has originally been compromised by the Italian football team in Serie A, but in the D-loc of Mesteria, it began with a strong 2-1-wishing force from Manchester City.
The battery was about ten minutes before the end of the Youth Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack broke down the fragile Sergei Aguero's escape.
Aguero, who was shot in the weekend election game, came to the field for the last ten minutes.
Also, Manchester's second follow-up to the United experienced severe PSV in the Netherlands in the face of the 1-2 battle against PSV Endhoven.
Luke Shaw's visit, a 20-year-old representative of ManU, is always just a matter of waiting.
The PSV's dangerous appearance of Hector Moren became so dangerous that the attack against the ManU package was so bad that Shaw probably got confused.
Shaw sakg Eindhoven's home at ten minutes before his medical staff took him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay will take you to the 41st minute, 1-0, but ManU's joy lasts only a few minutes.
Moreno recovered before he fell asleep in the extra hour.
The PSV’s battery was on the other side of Luciano Narsingh.
On the way through the landscape, the cross of the Mestres started in the Paris St. Germain.
In the case of Manchester United's successor to the PSG, Angel Di Maria was replaced by Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria was moved right through the palace to the end of Malmö's capital, Johann Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half of the PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been weakened by a number of long-term successes.
It is not wrong to be angry, but Malmö, which is too young, is not the best possible comparison point.
PSG's major actor Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional team at Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmös in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moskova TsSKA lost the B-class in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party called for an immediate difference - the president had made a mistake.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe spoke the same way he had been in months ago.
Mr Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has spoken again in the country's Parliament, which he had to speak at the end of the month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe did not appear to have felt the same thing.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91st year of Mugabe is in full force.
The MDC party requires Mugabe to be different because this is too old to rule.
The supporters of Mugaben were quick to say that the scandal had occurred only in Mugaben's presence and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben spoke earlier and now the impact of China on the economy of the country.
Germany and Austria want more summits on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have introduced the summit of EU leaders for the first week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council for Summits, assesses the request.
According to Germany's Deputy Director Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with non-members and how they will be able to achieve more effective registration.
According to Merkel, negotiations on the quota for asylum seekers are part of the internal ministers' window.
A teacher will give his shooter his girlfriend during the emergency call
I'm just saying a few color university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "cult dog" is alive and probably confused, and said that the contact of the woman’s closest neighbors was found on this phone.
The police in the house found a message written on Amy Prentiss' body and hate page: "I am so sorry I wish I could take this dear Amya and he is the only woman who has ever loved me," says the letter, which experts say is signed by Lambi.
No mention was made that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Minnesota Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school campus where the police believed in his shooting and killing history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this workroom.
The police officer of Delta State University Lynn Buford told the university staff about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
He told Lambi to call his lawyer some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths had risen again: Lamb had committed suicide by limiting himself to the police.
The authorities were still trying to find out the motive of Lambi after the student and staff had to leave behind the doors locked behind.
In both parts of the state, researchers have published information that, according to them, students and staff described Lambia as a gift teacher who, however, had problems.
The students told me they were waiting for her feelings.
I'm the Prentissian, Gautier, police say that Lambi has not had violent history or criminal records.
Schmidt himself had included Lambi in writing his book, where he thanked "good people", with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught social information and history at the institution where there are 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of each man.
On the other hand, there were some significant problems.
The student, Brandon Beavers, called Lambia, but said that she was also affected by her nervousness and untidyness, "nothing like something was wrong with her."
Another student, Michael Sykes, told Lambi that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked a nurse from Delta State University to say that he had some health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's remuneration principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not tell him about the automatic development and the responsibility of the assistant professor.
Director of the University, William LaForge, said that Lambi and Schmidt did not know any differences, but that "there was something in Lambi's mind."
Lamb can't answer these questions anymore.
After Lamb had escaped from the camp, the police came after him when he moved back from the state of Mississippi.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself in a .38-caliber gun at one of the back of a building, about half a mile south of his parents' house in the city of Mississippi Greenville, told the death researcher Methel Johnson of the Washington area.
The Lamb's car was still on the road.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he thought Lamb knew people there.
Lamb was in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and learned farming and growth skills. There are 3500 students at the university, and it is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb worked in the doctorate's growth data in the summer.
One of Lambi's old friends described him as smart, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 when they met with fellow friends.
Hairston's friend was in the library, and Lamb was a fun, older friend who had been trying to teach him to play the guitar for many years.
He was a bit of a horror at those times.
All the girls were in pain when she was in the place, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the city of Jackson in Brandon.
Well, Lamb and Prentiss were obviously out of line for a while.
In the emergency, Lamb told his wife that he had killed her, but there is no evidence in their marriage.
They had a bright-fashioned dog that lived with them at the railway station in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was okay.
Prentissian former husband Shawn O'Steen told them that they were divorced 15 years ago, but they are still friends, and they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Stepe described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said she didn't meet Lambia, but she had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb had been interested in music and called blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when Lamb and Abigail were both in the summer market three years ago.
Later on, they called together in some places.
O'Steen told her daughter to make and sing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different network companies.
The Julep Room bar and a temporary winter organizer, Mike Shaffer, located near the Gautier, told him that he saw Lambi and Prentiss at the last night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and leather career to a rare public.
Nothing made me feel like I was in hell.
"Only a happy marriage," he said.
We went over and we threw our kisses to each other.
So they were both pretty tight.
The dead teacher Schmidt conducted the first-year student seminar program and had specialized in the Indians and the history of the transition, told school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married, and he had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas Emporia State, as well as at the president of his community and the school management.
On Tuesday morning, in Cleveland, Delta State, a poll was held, involving about 900 people, including the teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt’s wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the event that during the summer college, they sang songs to Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching goes on in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to get our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
Now's the time to make a move.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police now say that Lambi was called after Schmidt's emergency call, and that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss' wife during the call, there is no evidence that they would have been married.
Toys R Us plans to pay less workers for the loan
Toys R Us says that it does not pay as many workers as last year to rent, but the resurgence of toys and baby products says that it is possible to make more hours for the current stable and long-term workers.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in traffic and distribution centres in different parts of the country, when there were 45,000 employed in 2014.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the applicants' questionnaires began this month, and the number of staff rose from October to December.
Although the holiday period is months, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the sale, delivery and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox smiles at his "treffet" with Princess Diana
Back in the future, Michael J. Fox had an important moment of professional greatness.
It was also significant for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for royal arrivals, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I ordered that the place in Princess Diana was next to me," he said the next documentary back in Time trailer.
The film begins and I think I'm just in the middle of an activism and a handcuff with Princess Wales.
Back in Time is a document back to the future, which was challenged by Foxia, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the leader of Robert Zemecki and producer Steven Spielberg.
He'll be back in the future 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "I don't think it's the best time for me."
Back in Time is available on a free video, DVD and some movies in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria is not resolved by means of arms
Mr. Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "does not solve armed conflict", and only increases violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations called again on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told the press on Wednesday that he was going to see five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional authorities "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban asked five permanent Member States to show solidarity and unity in dealing with the Syrian crisis, as they demonstrated in the context of Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support request results showing that Donald Trump is real
Some have tried to find him as a fireman.
The others just like him.
Some of us are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to delay Donald Trumpi from the petition of support, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In the last 11 national issues, Donald Trump has been led by a two-digit chapter, and some have started seriously what this means with regard to the appointment opportunities of the building king.
The choice is exactly the same as at the beginning.
These results do not yet mean that it is likely to be the subject of the Republicans.
The commentators note that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing its leadership to Herman Cain, who had been unable to return to any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, foreign groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth have noted the presence of Trump and have begun to use his resources to cover it.
The following recent applications for asylum indicate that there is not only a final stage in the building kingdom:
The members of the team have made a final decision.
Just before Donald Trump announced his proposal in the middle of June, Monmouth University's support questions showed that only two of the ten republics had a positive attitude toward the capital city.
By mid-May, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six of the ten Republicans have welcomed Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they're negative.
These chapters also take their place in the first Member States.
At the university of Quinnipic in Iowa, 60 percent of Republicans reported their positive attitude toward Trump last week.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if the Tromp was to be asked.
In the CNN/ORC issue last week, 67 per cent of Republican citizens said they would either be "invited" or "required" if Trump was willing.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "reproached" if they'd be willing.
Only Ben Carson gets the same level of enthusiasm at the same time as Trump (43% "innovated" vs. Trump 40%).
Next thing you want to be interested in?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican voters would be "unnecessary" or "accused", if they were to be offered the consent of the citizens of Jeb Bush.
The nature of the storm is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpie has been widely criticized for his excellent speech and speech, according to the ABC News/Washington Post, 52 per cent of the national voters at the national level think that the seat of the king of the building is suitable for the president.
According to Quinnipic's survey last week, the number of Republicans in the first half-session in Iowa is the same: 52 per cent of the Republicans think that Trumpil has an appropriate nature for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Postin, 44 per cent of them think that their nature does not apply to the operation of the President, and almost six out of ten believe that their nature does not belong to the White House.
The representatives of the Republic of the Republic are committed to the idea.
When the Republicans think as commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, it was likely that, in the case of the most likely option, Turkey would be designated as a candidate for the Republicans.
By the end of July, four and a half people supported Jeb Bush.
Release of information: The Republican party's voters have not always had a potential crystal ball in their use.
At the last election this time, four tenths of the Republicans felt that Rick Perry would be appointed as a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the voters in the Republican side consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Although the Republicans were determined to support another candidate, Trump would win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the Overseas Field is likely to have promoted the direction of Trump, as the anti-Trup support has divided between numerous other candidates.
However, at the beginning of September of the multimouth University, the issue showed that in a hypothetical two-dimensional case between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority of support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina on 13 points, Marco Rubiota on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bushia on 19 points, and Rand Paulia, John Kasichi and Chris Christie on every 33 points.
He's with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to Trumpin?
If they were to be held against, Ben Carson would win the deal with Mr. Trump's 18-point difference.
Just as the majority of the supporters of Donald Trump have been informed of their decision.
The new CBS/NYT issue shows that only a few more than half of the supporters of Trump have decided who will vote.
The situation can naturally change, and no one can be absolutely sure that they will never change their minds.
46 percent said they could possibly change the candidate.
In any case, the biggest competitor of Trump is currently a second unlikely winner, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but the voters who said their decision are twice more likely on the side of Trump.
Six of the ten Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the move.
Since two months ago, Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants in his campaign initiative, the migration has been in the middle of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned about the fact that the magnitude of the Tromp is driving Latin voters away from the republican side and harming the re-insurance companies.
According to a new ABC/Post questionnaire published today, six of the ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it turns out that as long as migration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
The government has grown to the point of a new hole.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their political position outside the country.
Six of the ten Republicans said on the ground in ABC/Post question that they prefer to choose a political outsider than a person with a government experience.
They are also hostile to the Government of the United States.
Two weeks back, the Des Moines Register/Blomberg questionnaire from Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans have been contaminated by the Republicans at the Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "very angry".
Jeremy Corby's priority at the Prime Minister's session
Corbyn's priority was eagerly expected from his selection
The new director of the Labour Department, Jeremy Corby, will meet David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's session.
Corbyn will raise his first six questions after a few months, and probably both media and labour-sustainers will confirm his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show of "lower theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to take care of his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial to be conducted by Corbyn after he was appointed as a security guard and spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Organisation for Trade.
At the same time, the decision of the Head of the Labour Party to stand in silence during the national ceremony in the memorial service organized on the 75th day of the British Air Force has raised the appreciation of the Conservative Party's representatives and in many pre-trial cases.
Corbyn's decision to sing without singing has raised his voice
The representative of Corbyin said that he was "regardably silent" and that he recognises "the sport of Royal Air Force in the Ison-British Air Station."
Mr Owen Smith, a member of the Corbyn Security Council, pointed out to the BBC Twin Newsnight programme that he would have called on the Head of the Labour Party to sing a national song despite the fact that he thought the palace should be stopped.
Nearly a thousand foreign ministers have refused to be involved in the internal affairs of the West Bank in the economic, defence and external affairs of Corbyn.
BBC policy writer Robin Brant says that the lines on the position of the party in the European Union and the government's aid burden have also been "used" since Corby's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Central Organization of Professional Unions that the working party would present a change that would remove the entire burden.
Years later, the Secretary of Labour and Housing of the Security Council Smith stated that the party was "very clear" in that they only opposed the government's plans to count 26,000 points to 230000 points.
Corbyni will be the fifth head of the working party, whom David Cameron has met during the last decade, during which he has been the director of the conservative party.
The Head of the Labour Party has promised a new approach policy, and now he has "complicated" ideas to the Prime Minister, and has received over 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, rapporteur for the Islington North, has said that the prime minister's nature is too contradictory and that he is going to hold on to exact words and promise to cut down on such serious issues as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the Department of Economic Affairs, Angela Eagle, is acting in his place in the hours of question when Corby was not involved, for example, when Cameron is outside.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he is close to the chairman of the lower room, John Bercowia, on the subject.
When Cameron grew up in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theatre, which is often combined with the Prime Minister's comments, but later he had to admit his failure.
From the time they were started on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's polling hour has been an important measure in assessing the ability of the Director to consider, manage his premises, and his position on behalf of other citizens, even though the assessors have criticized the fact that they have become a mere figurines that require long-term reforms.
Pictures in Joburg: Uneducated young people are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former children have found a way to learn skills and learn a new way of life.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a winning non-profit studio where young people are taught how to take pictures in their neighborhood and get it won.
BBC News met one of the first young people in the project.

Red value increases in the rate of the Iso-British growth
The red value fell to the top after the numbers showed rise in Iso-British wage growth and at the same time the FTSE 100 index increased through SABMille.
Between July and July, the wages of the Ison-British, including bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same date in the last year.
The rate of growth was rapid after 2009, and it was considered to be estimated at the rate of recovery.
The point rose by over a percentage against $1,5505 and EUR 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
FTSE 100 index was closed by 1.49 % to 6229.21.
SABMiller was a separate market share and increased by 20% after the offer of AB InBev was approached by the competitor.
The agreement would combine two world-wide pressures and other brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9% after the competitive luxury product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales conditions were better expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is the opening market in Burberry, had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5 percent after the miner said that it had accumulated $2.5 billion by counting the shares to move as part of its debt strategy.
The Packaging and Paper Group Mond's shares were the largest bidder in the index 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation on the business form "my".
JD Sports increased 3.1% after the company published a half-year of production of the information before the tax: 83% increased by 46.6 million points.
According to JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
JD Sports, director of the company Peter Cowgill, says that if the minimum wage of workers is raised in the UK, it can mean "the potential consumer purchasing power".
However, this purchasing power is probably not above the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill is real.
The costs could be linked to the company's enlargement plans, and he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash begins the campaign against the Aldin earthquake
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA son from Aldin attack in South and Western Australia.
Metcash food support campaigns have been launched to defend the market share of IGA-gas companies in South and Western Australia before Aldin's assault of $700 million.
Aldi prepares two distribution units and the first opening of trade in South and Western Australia first in the first year, where there are up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food distributors and build IGA brands through the marketing of government and social media, as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA's traders and buyers have agreed, and brands such as from Dunsborough's producer Simmo's offer pets in IGA's shops, and merchants sell discount prices to customers on Australian football.
Metcashi is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this strategy for food, alcohol and iron is organised on the annual day of the investor strategy.
There is a lot to play, as South and Western Australia totals nearly 30 per cent of the Metcashi IGA area, and the production margins are higher than the Metcashi IGA network of the former Member States.
The buyers of South and Western Australia are known to be Norwegians, and IGA resellers have a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the south and 24 per cent in the west compared to 14 per cent in the former countries.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will shoot about 5 percent of the food market in these two Member States within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In his weekly report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA’s resellers could spend $360 million a year on sales and Metcash could spend $250 million by the end of 2016.
This prophecy is based on the assumption that Aldi is opening up for the first time in the year 25 and 30 in the south, producing 500 million and 600 million turnovers in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities in the Metcashi high-cost support point can pay Metcashi around $13 million prior to peaks and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in the former countries mainly for Aldi and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA's customers were all more faithful.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food and food consumption will be 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the managing director of the Investment Report and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said in Melbourne that Metcash can "as much as possible destroy within ten years".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcashi Government should have contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has been calculated by 18 per cent since 2010, and the products from Metcashi food and food business, which concerns about about 1200 IGA customers, have been calculated 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the reduction in the debt management of activities when pressures are imposed on sales and margins.
However, the aid costs are half and have invested more than $150 million annually on the basis of the calculation of the prices of hundreds of products at the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA customers to improve their sales prices by increasing the growth of food and by making market products better selected for personal brands.
President Ian Morrice says that the calculation of prices and the adjustment of sales has increased the volume of sales, and he hopes that the aid will return to the road to production in 2017, for the first time in four years.
The president of the Australian Tennis Union, Steve Healy, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more respect than criticism for its use
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer in a recent drought, which has broken his friend Nick Kirkios around. He deserves more respect than criticism of his own use, says President Steve Healy of the Australian Tennis Union.
The two younger members of the "Special Ks" gift, called "Special Ks", had to be invited to attend a public event in which Kirgios was hosted by Stan Wawrinkaa Montreal Masters in the contest.
Shortly after this, in a prison trial in Cincinnati, the final judge had to two separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison from the other, when Harrison announced, "Wawrinka should have been looking for Kyrkios, and I should have been looking for that bitch."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen throwing his country away after the cramp hit his possible victory of Richard Gasquetti in the US Open, Healy has been an innocent advocate of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is at Glasgow to compete with Sam Grothin in the second place with Bernard Tomic in the British semifinals.
"I'm pretty strong about the idea that Thanas has only been given a little water," said Healy.
He broke his mail to destroy his mail because of a crack in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when it's dirty, and I know Thanas needs to know that he's not successful.
But she's been doing very well, even in almost provable situations with the US Open in Harrison, and so on, and I think she deserves cancer.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been hit a little hard.
He is well capable of 19 years of age, he works closely, according to the team, and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is valued in the gambling room, he is actively practicing well, he is very well and is very peaceful and capable young, and I think he should evaluate them according to his reasons.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take the important games that started on Friday, describing this "common decision" for all your good solutions, but I still support the Canberra return to the team's insurance office.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all non-profits around [Kyrgyos]," Healy said.
And Nick has been hit really fast, as Federer and Murray have noticed, and he's grown up in the public, and has made some mistakes and deserves all of his criticism. However, we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it's best for both the team and if he's sometimes gone away from the public on the basis of these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary publishes emergency, closes borders, keeps immigrants
The Hungarians published an exception and closed the southern border of Serbia with respect to those who were trying to come to the country illegally.
At the border, the chaos was followed by hundreds of immigrants flocked to an isolated area, and the Serbian authorities responded with a shock.
People who have taken their homes violently have now been able to stay and set up for an unlimited period of time between the two countries.
However, there was an increase in obesity.
While the police helicopter stopped at their top, the immigrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted applause to the Hungarian melka police.
Some rejected food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it is an "impossible acceptance" of the transitional return from Hungary as they get more from Macedonia and Greece all the time.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of a solution, not cause damage to citizens.
The debate must be held in the near future with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The Sekasorto was born between Hungary and Serbia following the failure of the 28 Nationality Group to establish a common immigration policy at a large meeting in Brussels.
Ministers were of the same opinion of the same year as 40 000 asylum seekers, who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers were actively talking about reaching the final agreement - first month or first year by the end of the year - about what EU countries take from 120 000 additional seats, including part of Hungary.
For the first week of the EU summit, the Federal Republic of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, have already called for a debate on the country's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not expect its neighbours or Brussels to act in the near future.
In the two southern regions, however, the emergency gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed you to be shut down and the security officers could be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that aid is available at Serbia's borders, the country is also going to be able to enable a small part of the rural aid to stop its borders across the country of immigrants.
CBS News writer Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners had been colored by the last visit between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and access point for refugees from the European Union, many of whom are fighting from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of the achievements are economical in the pursuit of a better life, and not the refugees who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly disputed with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in Hungary are now defined as a crime to exceed or damage the company from 4 metres (13 feet) of foot-and-mouth disease, which the government has built against the southern border of Serbia, as well as contain further criminal penalties for convicted persons.
"Because of the situation caused by the change in the landscape, Hungary's government announces an emergency," the government rapporteur Zolta Kovacs told reporters in the south of the city of Szeged.
In fact, we are very clear: crossing the Laiton border is a crime.
Parliament still has to accept the war situation expected for the first week, but the Associated Press suppliers have seen heavily armed military personnel armed with vehicles and guns for days.
Orban’s domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bacondi, said that the authorities had arrested 45 people while they were trying to cross the border, and 15 of the country’s most prolonged occupations.
They have been able to help, they are now a police prisoner, and they are accused of crimes defined in new laws.
Officials will be quick to fix my help.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven outposts against Serbia after they had sent one of these sites to the border.
Near the border crossing point, Hungary was hidden in a cave when the Hungarians opened a small metal count for the treatment of the people and the mob were trapped inside.
About 20 came in, but thousands remained outside.
A group of immigrants supported the main engines between Serbia and Hungary saying they refused to eat and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 options: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has been disappointed
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to be a two-digit leader of democracy, but Senator Bernie Sanders has arrested him.
Clintonia now supports 47 per cent of the Democrats (less than 58 per cent) and another 27 per cent of Sandersi support (up 17 per cent).
The vice-president, Joe Biden, has not yet reported whether he will join the Presidential Council, but he will support 15 per cent of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-war, most of the Democrats are saying that it is still too early to say that they would have decided to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice rather than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's recommendation has been calculated by several groups in the last few months after the CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time, Sanders has risen to some level.
Clinton is a strong leader of women and Maltese couples, but his leadership has been disappointed.
His recommendation to a couple of men has been greatly calculated, and Sanders is only 5 percent of the units behind.
Clinton's progress has been lost within the ranks of the 50-year-old Democrats, and he is now at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly responsible for some of the parents' voters.
Last month Clinton led Sandersia on a double-legged list, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democracies say they are actively supporting Clinton if they come from the side.
On Thursday, he says he's supporting him with some savings, and 15 percent would just support him because he's willing.
Six percent wouldn't even support him.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more consistent with those who do not currently support Clinton - only the fourth would actively support him.
In which 48% of Democrats say that they would actively support Clinton, the Republican community member Donald Trump says that the Republican voter (35%) says the same.
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the recommended answer was that he had an appropriate experience (16%). Afterwards the most recommended responses were that it is now the right time for the president (13%) and that he is the best candidate (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions and the possibility of complaint were also mentioned.
Since the vice-president is acting as the presidential candidate, 57 per cent of the Democrats would like to see him in the trial, although there are different opinions on the third side.
When asked about democratic candidates, who chose the second half, Biden is the preferred choice.
In the middle of Clinton's supporters, over half said they chose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides to be unintended democracy, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden goes, the lead is 20%, but if he leaves, the count is 30.
55% of Democrats believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning presidential elections, but this figure has been reduced by 78% over the past month.
By this measure, Biden remains long, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the voter has grown.
When asked what is most important in the proposal, however, they raise their views on the need to vote.
Also, in recent months, no one has been regarded as a candidate for democratic candidates or potential candidates for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates will be able to make a good deal of progress in the medium of the voter.
Most think of Clinton, Sanders and Bidenia as real, reliable and powerful leaders.
Biden's going through three of the best in reality, when Clinton's strength is the driving force.
30 per cent of Democrats say they do not consider Clinton to be real and reliable, which is twice as likely as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrats also generally consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be ideologically identical.
When we look at all these steps, about a quarter of the Democrats say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and the use of a servant as a foreign minister continues to raise questions, most Democrats are satisfied with his explanation and say that the matter did not affect their general leadership.
However, it's different when it's considered American as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third of them are satisfied.
The people's opinions were divided in March shortly after the day came.
Most Americans say that the e-mail didn’t affect their overall message from Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinions had fallen from him.
More than six of the ten Republicans say their views on Clinton have changed worse.
Although Clinton's voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is the problem for him in the middle of all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has been calculated 8 percent units in the last month and 15 percent units in May.
62% of registered voters say they do not consider Clinton to be real and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 per cent of registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be real and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered a good leader.
The six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush, are considered more realistic.
Sanders are generally considered to be true, but many have no opinion of him, just like Carson's.
The wrong margin in the study involving 351 Democrats is 6 per cent.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trumpi on the national issue
Ben Carson comes to Donald Trump next to CBS News/New York Time
Two of the candidates joined the new party on the subject by leaving all the votes to the other side of the fight against foreigners.
Through the Republicans, the country still supports the country's strong support for Trump, whose support has grown earlier, before the last month of the CBS issue of the Fox News.
However, Carson grew from six percent to 23 percent at the same time.
The question also revealed that Carson was very different from the demographic groups and was cut off from the centre of the Republicans of the High Schools of Trump.
The finals of the field have been left, with the exception of Carly Fiorinaa and Ohio Governor John Kasichia. Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker's support has been calculated at the latest: 10 percent of the current rate of 2 percent in the last month.
Former Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio, are at the level of 6 per cent.
The latest issue in September of this issue of 376 Republican voter is +/- 6 per cent.
Last week, the latest issue of CNN/ORC showed that Carson was growing in this area: he has 19% of the population's support, and Trump is still 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post issue, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
In the wake of Carson's suggestion last week, Trump criticized her pension for remaining neurosurgery, even though Carso asked for forgiveness for the evolution of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last night in the campaign show in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of the first year of Baruch College.
Nearly two years after the student died in the concentration camp at the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountain area of Pocono, there was a murder of five people.
The members of the Baruch College in New York City, Pi Delta Psi, visited the Society at the time of Chun "Michael" Deng's campaign in September 2013, and then rushed to his hospital after his death, after which the police reported.
Officials say that Dengi's eyes were attached and his eyes were weighed more than 13 kilograms full of snow, and then he was taken back to the ground again when he tried to walk the black hole towards the ground.
In the end, Deng chose to suffer his head and then lost his consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood did not call the emergency number Deng, but they waited for an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Dengi's clothes to search for information on his infection, and to contact the national president of the brotherhood, Andy Mengi, who asked about this advice, the police officer Chris Wagner told the press department.
"In this case, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, established the welfare of the brotherhood to Michael Deng," said police officer Wagner.
It's not gonna work out, and he died the next morning.
According to the Dead Sea Scroll, Deng was restored to the bones of the bones of the head, the backbone and the journey.
"A large number of families have had to suffer at least one student's death every year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, an expert representing the Deng family, in his opinion.
Brothers and their families must be held accountable, and this is an important step in the administration.
On the part of the Major Party of the Monroe Region, the first five members will be charged with the murder of the third stage.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also guilty of violent crime and crime.
"We do not want to be responsible only for individuals. If there is any organization behind the incident that has officially or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held responsible," Wagner stated in a certain press release.
Baruch College rejected the association of the brotherhood and the national brotherhood as a part of the local community.
This happens when the United States Central Bank raises a high level of credit.
There will be an alarming rise, and the market for rising rates will disappear, the outputs of mass bonds will rise and the economy will have to collapse.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this whole thing goes or how long it lasts.
History does not just help the timing of what is to be referred to as the economy.
The first rise has taken only 11 months, sometimes for as long as 86 months.
In the United States, the aggressiveness of the Central Bank in the rise of the peaks has often, although not always, to be determined by the way the economy and the financial resources react.
Therefore, the officials of the Central Bank in the United States have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on the rise of peaks, but rather on the normalization of the situation in the course of the development framework.
In fact, there's a lot of change.
In the end, however, market parties may find that all mergers involving coronation have been exceeded.
"The first increase in the global economic crisis following the first global economic crisis is without a doubt to be interpreted in some areas for the end of the term 'mean money'," said the Global Economics chief economicist Julian Jessop in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the United States to return to normal, even if it is still weak, to such an amazing degree that many feel afraid.
However, this does not mean that it would not have any effect.
There is a view in the field of how some of the economic sectors will react on the basis of previous development:
As the market has seen in the last about a month, waiting for the rise of the hill can cause uncertainty.
When it comes to raising the truth, the effect is not so dramatic.
"It appears that the capital product will stop for the first 12-24 months after the first increase, which may re-examine the reference to monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, about 14 per cent of the increase, 250 days after that situation is fairly low (meaning 2.6 per cent) and normality has been achieved in the last six-year average production of 14.4 per cent, is reported in a recent analysis of the capital strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management company Bob Doll, published in Barron's newspaper.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the growth cycle when the products start to count.
Students are part of the economy, but pride often promotes their income.
In the present situation, the Central Bank has yet to face certain challenges that have not been before and which can be accelerated.
This is particularly a gross product, which must be almost at the lowest level of all time before the central bank collapses.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP of 118 in the post- 1950s was less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, it is rare to believe that when the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, the reserve bank of the state of Atlanta says.
The rise of the peaks in this terrible economic situation can be risky and raise the question, "Is this a different time," said Deutsche Bank.
The market participants have reserved the central bank for growth throughout the year, and all are waiting this week for a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end in Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, it is expected that only 25% of the increase will be possible.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all growth cycles have been shown to be in the supercycles of increased virulent effects, in which BKT has stopped hitting its front peak very soon after the beginning of life," the report says.
On the other hand, at the start of this period, there has been an exceptional slowdown in the development, which has been worse than the discovery.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has looked forward to the end of the last decade: the forecast has been 35 months, and now it is already in the course of 74 months.
The solid product has also been uncertain as the market waits for coherence, and the model reminds some of the findings of some tax capital.
The point is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are seen in debt books faster than in shares.
The direction of the small products appears to vary immediately in relation to the first increase/reduction of the cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, the cost of debt is calculated immediately," Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the rise of peaks leads to a closer approach to the products of longer- and shorter-term debt registers, thus reducing production gap.
High-performance batch lists often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still alert to the search for a product", according to the Schwabin-based product analysis of Kathy Jones in some studies.
Amazingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's line approach.
"In addition to the calculation of the dollar's strength and inflational expectations, there are many signs that the market has adjusted to a more precise approach to monetary policy," he wrote.
The short-term thresholds are higher, the production rate is higher, the credit margin has increased and the uncertainty has increased - all these are private markets when the central bank has increased its line.
In general, by taking companies whose business is mainly invested in the United States, they will win when the prices rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-stakeholder companies, which have a lot of debt, do better when the value of the dollar increases from their products on the world market and their profit will be higher than their funding.
"The history shows that 'quality' shares are generally more productive in the first three months after the first collection," Goldman Sachsin's analysts pointed out to customers in their report.
Companies with a strong trade change ended up in decline after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increase by five percentage points.
Companies with high capital output and low volume shares were more effective than low-fat companies. The first mean was 4 (percent unit) and the last 3 (percent unit).
There's gonna be a big problem with the brother.
The companies that have a lot of variable debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
There is also an opportunity for consumers to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also benefit from higher products, even though experts agree on how fast the impact is.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, citizen Andrew Bingham says
Conservative sponsor Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "citizenization"
He claims that its separation from the commercial competitor will become even more difficult.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards prizes saying they were just traveling Brit Awards tickets.
Damien Collins criticised The Voice said that it was not the same
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" for Classic FM, claiming that the leading producer's pressure in addition to the production company proves that it does something that commercial manufacturing companies do not.
Conservative promoter Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio station had an impact on the content of the "citizen" and that it is even more difficult to distinguish itself from a commercial competitor.
"Between that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "citizens" - is changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also took the lead in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"Last year's BBC Music Awards affect only a variety of names from the British Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two direct examples of how you actually copied something that is already available on the market," Bingham said.
The president of the BBC questioned the allegations that BBC Radio 3 is a lot ahead of its commercial competitor to live music and to share information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, one of the primary categories.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and in order to present new texts," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the channel had to do more work than before for the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer that was criticised for the arrest of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Damien Collins of the Conservative Tory Party criticized The Voicea, a music competition that the BBC purchased from the Dutch production company Talpa Media at 22 million points, according to estimates.
Do you understand why I often discuss this programme, since it is not original and it is not entirely independent?
Rodri Hall claimed that this program of BBC1 canals, where Paloma Faith and Boy George are involved, has been produced in "the style of the BBC".
He added that he wanted the company to "find success within its own house" the next time it started the winter season.
However, he did not consent to prevent future production of The Voice files, or to determine that the funds of the taxpayers would be used in other late forms.
Netcomination rose second in August, Black Friday may be the cause
Networking increased by 7% in 2015 in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase after the start of the statistics.
Three years ago, the network came to strengthen the use of mobile devices for purchases.
Experts believe in November Black Friday may delay spending
The production of plant farms has increased significantly over a decade and has transformed many British mining cities into mining cities.
However, experts say that the air is now marked by a levelling of network communications when the latest lists showed only 7 per cent increase for the first annual report of 2015.
The total expenditure in August was then reduced at the beginning of the year 2000: only five per cent increase over the last year.
Experts say that there are signs in the air of a reduction in network traffic, when the latest lists showed only 7 per cent increase for the first annual year of 2015.
"If we look at the growth rates for the next few years and return to the year 2000, it was clear that the situation would be reasonable over time," said the supplier of the JMRG sales index, Guardian.
He explained that three years later the network came to an end when buyers began using their mobile phones for purchases.
It meant that most people made online purchases and that they were able to do them in different environments, as well as in the summer.
But now it's equal, and (growling) can count.
From America, Black Friday's science has been regarded as one reason behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will slow down the production of purchases before the last spring of November.
In recent years, the average value is five times higher than that of the purchasers for mobile computers to throw goods into a lot of trading sites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got buyers to suit the findings, can stop buying.
In a study published by the British Retail Consortium, only one point was used on the network.
More than one third of the purchases of certain products, such as television and swimming pools, are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and blankets from the network instead of using purchased formers.
The Muslims bury the deaths of the Meka as a result of the failure of hunger strike, the consequences for the Bin Laden family
Muslims buried 29 corpses dead during the first funerals in Mexico
Saudi Arabia has been partly accused of falling victim to the construction of Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that, in total, 394 people were injured when the foot-circuit dropped down
29 The dead were cast into the lake of fire, and hundreds of Muslims were gathered to bury them. The victims died when the tower fell in the cave of Mekah.
In particular, white - haired mortals carried out their journey to honor the first of the dead who had made their last trip to Al-Moaissem's homeland.
The sad journey ended in a holy place, where just a few days later, the hill tower fell through the valley of the mosque and fell down to worship.
The bodies were released to be burned when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family as a criminal disaster, which also killed 394 people.
The bodies of the 29 bodies killed in the Great Mechanical Hemisphere were buried in the cave.
The group of dead had four children from Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, where he was the first to leave the shrine when the tower fell.
Akram had been in a big box with his parents before the start of the annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already vowed that the Gulf of Mecca will continue as thousands continue to reach the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the nest on the ground when it wasn't in use.
In an Arabic version of the decision published by the Government’s Saudi Press Agency, the Binladin Group was said to be partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the company did not mention this detail, but it was said that the directors of the company had been prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman announced that he had found out, which led to the destruction of the great monasteries at the site where hundreds of Muslims had gathered before this month's scheduled pilgrimage.
The Binladin Group has not published information on the collapse of the Roma and its representatives have not been able to make a comment.
The Royal Decision also found that it did not use time-consuming safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are about ten o'clocks around the mek's largest elevator, which are part of a large building building building run by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi Arabia family for decades, leading large construction projects.
Former leader of Al-Qaida Osama bin Laden was a capillary son whose family rejected in the 1990s.
It happened in the wind and in the sea, only days before millions reach the kingdom for the sacred absence of any Muslim who is able to do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities determined that a million riel (174,000 pounds) should be paid to the owners of the deceased and to the victims permanently.
Other broken-offs will receive half of this amount.
B&Q-Pomo says that European workers working in poor Eastern Europe are recommended behind
The British are still using more services for immigrants, Veronique Laurie says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe has increased
As a result, more 200 more Screwfix caps are opened for professionals.
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q mines around the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, city writer for Daily Mail
Britain is said to be free from taxes and pensions, and to pay more people in Eastern European workings for civil society.
It looks like if you're stuck with the left or you're going down the wall, you're at least right now.
The British sees are paying more and more helpers to handle road-se-se-tems in their codes, reports the company's bomb behind B&Q.
The new President of the Kingfisher, who owns the Kokonremonte market, Veronique Lauri, said that the recommendation is that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe be paid and that they offer them at their price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new workers for Screwfix and close 60 B&Q store.
Lauri said she wanted to add more women to work in B&Q, because eight out of ten shopping decisions are the most beautiful sexual activities.
Today most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population need to be taken into account: there are now more than one woman's economies in which more households are made than before.
Laurie said, "The most important part of our sales are still men.
We need to apply for a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the product purchase decisions are women.
Women have a great role to play in decision-making.
Lauri is one of only five women who are leading the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index, and she has restructured her leadership group so that there are a lot of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 percent of women are in the group, including its head and financial director.
He said, "This was a known decision - the difference here is an important matter.
There has been no difficulty finding good women in the leadership group."
Kingfisher announced the decrease in both productions for a half year and sales after the group took up the costs of closing the retail shops.
As a result of the trend, the Kingfisher owns the Screwfix and B&Q models are opening 200 new traffic.
The three governments soon decided to secure the proposed legislation in order to save the economy of the country.
We'll get the visible effects soon enough.
The decision taken by the SAK and other employers' organisations began to impose the same way and therefore the country stands at noon because of the broad opinion of the workers.
There is also reason for many of them to think.
Let's ask you if you'll be able to support the bill when it's going to be bad.
It's even established the counterattacks.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already reported that they are not going to participate in the media, but they are going to work.
That would have been impossible in the old age of consensus.
Of course, there was no net where to protest, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small person's political suicide.
Millions of professional organizations have little interest in the protest of a few tens of thousands of people, but it is a matter of thought.
The position of the trade union is no longer as clear as it was a year ago.
Not all are aware of the mobility goals, values have changed
The solutions to the government's interest in the operation of the Ai movement can also be seen as a direct gift to the sky.
When things have been going on for years, it is now late in the alliances that the rights of workers are protected, visible and well.
In this way, the government may wish to take over the role of the ay movement when the membership of the professional community is seen to be more important than earlier.
There are organisations doing whatever they like, so it is important that last year's opinion will somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for a while.
For example, industrial production has been estimated 31 months ago.
Gross income continues to decrease, and unemployment is rising.
You think these things will force everyone's head.
Heavy stock exchange at the University of Lepidenska: 8.5 million savings, personnel reduced by 130
The Technical University of the Children's Fund will start the savings period, which is aimed at obtaining total costs of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will launch the total staff consultation of 6.5 million each year.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 workers.
Another operation is to save two million more.
At the end of the YT negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to fall by 8.5 million under way.
This will also affect the government's settlement procedures.
In this account, the university is making about 2.6 million underscoring.
The costs will increase slightly for the first year, but the same amount from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and another EUR 3.2 million.
The total university budget is about EUR 85 million, so the target is 10% of the total budget.
The impact of cuts in mass education and research and the reduced impact of enterprise funding on our university level is very important, says Dr. Anneli Pauli in his report.
Before long, the effects of cuts were even more marginal, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trustees shall be initiated in the first week of the week and shall continue in the law within six weeks.
More: Onnibus wants to ride to Finland
The Dutch bus company Onnibus's owner, British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company is also referring to rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in going to the Finnish railway transport.
My Stageceach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter tells us.
The transport of bicycles shall be open to competition from time to time.
The first is the traffic of the capital city in the year 2017-2018.
After the traffic, you've got your truck on the hill.
Souter tells you he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport considers the plans of Onnibus to be welcome, according to Ylen.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport, at least in Transdev (formerly Veolia), which has an age of bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other European countries.
In the United States, the Central Bank must make high-level decisions
The rest of the world follows up when the United States Central Bank assembles for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether they are raising their high levels for the first time in almost ten years.
In Reuters I asked 80 economic operators a little more than half of those who still believed in the central bank's peaks last week now believe that the situation is still not resolved and that the rates are currently 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank broke down its debts in zero, it's seven years.
For the first time, we are in a close position, where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising high levels," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics, senior co-w.
In the United States, the economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought billions of dollars to the level and has created little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore less negative global views.
It has warned markets that they must be ready to rise, but the signs also show that they believe that the likelihood of increase is high.
The decision shall be published as Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi on Monday morning, before her colleague shot at the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was "failed" for his first murder and hoped, "you couldn't break it," the authorities told him frankly.
Missisipin Gautier's police told me that Delta State University's teacher of land and social information called the emergency number about ten o'clock in the morning.
yesterday and he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send constables to his home.
He said "his wife was killed last night" and also mentioned that in the house there's a "skin dog", which "does not bother anybody" but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller this name, but he didn't tell them.
Lamb didn't give the explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, they found 41-year-old Amy Prentiss in the body and 45-year-old Lambi, writing a message that read: "I'm so sorry that I could take it away.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who has ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb walked nearly 500 miles [500 km] to Delta State, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself after being arrested by the police yesterday.
Director of the University, William LaForge, said that Lambi and Schmidt did not know any differences, but that "there was something in Lambi's mind."
The authorities said that despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb had believed in Prentiss' relationship with Schmidt, there was no "more information or evidence" of any kind of "three-year-old".
Shawn O'Steen told me that she was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as "good for humanity."
A couple separated 15 years ago, but he remained a friend.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "skinned".
O'Steen said Prentiss and his daughter were "the best friends in the world."
According to Lindsday Knowles, Prentiss worked all over the network. According to Sun Herald, Prentiss was a close friend.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lambin for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police told Lambi to call their relatives somewhere on the ground to tell them that "he's not going to jail".
When the police wanted Lambi's government at 1:00 a.m. near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it and went to the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb claimed growth data from Delta State in February 2015, reports the list of claims found on the university’s website.

Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months because of double homicide.
Luke Shaw got double murder on his right foot at the loss of Manchester United PSV for Eindhoven in the passage of the Masters.
Although the defendant remained silent and was outside for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hoped that Shaw would be able to play in this distance.
Vampa was responsible for Héctor Moren's maintenance in 15 minutes after Shaw was in his 20s.
She was treated in the field for nine minutes and had to have diabetes before she left the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double leg and he's in the hospital now."
We'll move him tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then we'll be in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United by the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays great, and now he's going to do this.
When I was in the bathroom, he had a cigarette.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double homicide takes at least half a year, and he's not playing at a reading stage.
I hope he'll be able to play this way.
Moreno was happy when he got a red card and a penalty card.
Secretary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian consignor was missing.
You can judge yourself in a situation when I say there's a fine and a red card.
It was a really bad two-way drive.
Shaw tweeted: "Thanks to all of your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, starting with now, I'll be stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The English defence has an additional call for action in France for the first time in June.
PSV manufacturer Phillip Cocu said, "It's really bad for you."
If a player has to go out because of this shit, they're all very serious.
The purpose of our rescue is never to shoot an opponent.
Moreno was killed when he played in the Mexican Army against Van Gaal Holland in 2014 at the MM.
"Moreno takes this seriously, because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that you're really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing that was like that was a ball that was going in different directions, so it seemed as if he [Moreno] had touched it, but I did not see Luke’s direction.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel sorry for this, I'm so sorry."
Andres Guardado also went to the hospital after Chris Smalling attacked him.
How does David Cameron feel about Lorax?
Every parent learns soon about something: if your child loves something, he will not be long before he learns it almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the childcare service was asked by the Prime Minister in his favorite book, he selected Dr. Seussin The Lorax, a 1971 environmental protection story published.
The choice was a challenge, Cameron writes on the SuperCamps website in a message and goes on: "Hush, move, create and contain a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book to my children because it always feels like a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next chapter, where Cameron is supposed to describe the book, is a detailed version of the 2012 film, where almost a short list of new ideas and details were added to the original text.
"In the city of Tarville, which is in the city of Tarville, where all nature has been destroyed and even without commercialism, Ted- boy hopes to win his dream on the side of the girl's heart by fulfilling the hope of Audrey to see the right tree," says the text, describing the lover who died in 1991 by Dr. Seuss, rightly named Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not yet necessary, Cameron's text sounds to the place as if it had been taken from the website of the Internet Movie Database from the initial system of Lorax, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville in which everything is practical and even without the need for trade, Ted's son hopes to win his dream for Audrey's daughter's heart."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it is unlikely that he would be so unfathomable as a book. There a young man, named son, hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a weak, fragile tree and needs called Kerskan, regardless of the history of the short name, the weekend of Loraxi, who "speaks of trees".
This relatively invisible PR has probably been exposed to an assistant who has not apparently read a letter to the child 20 times later.
The Prime Minister's rapporteur said the text had come from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying on the side of the English team, but it was still a tough place.
To play against Pakistan in the Arab Republic is a hard task, but when you see what group England has chosen for the race, I don't think that the return of the last 3 to 0 line losses is likely.
I wouldn't close my neighbor's back.
The Dutch Cook side may have been less experienced than a three-year regroup, but it includes good circles and the team's thinking is strong: they do not have an army since 2012, but a young position.
A lot of Ali is developing around the world, and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there are unknown factors at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth tipped off the British Cricket Team, his position will be Alex Halles
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is reasonable to analyze the problem to me because I'm his prime minister in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good opponents in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh fact is that the cricket players are evaluated on the basis of their results.
For example, Joe Root's choice was no uncertainty before you knew, because, as I said earlier, players are the best choices.
About a hundred points, and Lythin's long team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more drive to Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
The English Prime Minister Trevor Bayliss oversaw Lythin's position even when he didn't do as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me. Lyth is first of all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long it will take to leave.
Lyth was selected seven times in the field, like Sam Robson before him, when Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was allowed to play at home and in the neighborhood.
The only cause of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in the summit, but it is now the chance of the past.
Alex Halles will come along, and there are cuts I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of something that we've seen in Yorkshire earlier this time when he made 236 points against us in the field of Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this truth must depend on a group in the United States of Arab States.
The idea of Moeen's skirmish in Cook's neighborhood has been echoed, where there would be more to the field but four to be held fast, and I am not against it.
I don't understand why the cuts could be cut there, and this left-wing has already proved to be a pretty cricket player.
Most of them didn't have to do their job in Worcestershire, but they're three and there's no difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first slot before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He just made a three-point score and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a group of thieves, and, as far as I've been with her, she feels very impressed with the young man.
People can see his unfathomable statistics in short, the average of 31, with a ball 35, and think that it is a threat, but there are not too many hunters and voters who choose young ones.
He learned a lot about this race.
In England outside the group, there seems to be a few serious increases in the preparation side.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan bat Mahela Jaywarenden to consult with games can be proven to be a necrosis.
He is one of the most popular friends in the game, and he brings with him a great deal of experience because he has done everything in the situation and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will come to the white ball games, and bring energy and endless destruction.
I have always thought that he was born into being in international circles, was then playing or preparing, and he has the same useful skills as Mahela.
At times, new voices in the kitchen may be able to force the team, even if their message was the same as before.
Collyn's teammate of Durham, Ben Stokes, is agreed on a day-on-day, a similar blow was given to Roito against Australia, and I have no problem with this at all.
Although not all agree, manufacturers and voters do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a simple basis.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can be won if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's semi-recognizable strategy to keep Britain in the EU is still facing the biggest problems of the day, even though it would not even be taken into account by the heartless Jeremy, "Is it right?" Corbyn would choose the lead of the party or the capacity of the union organization as a candidate for Europe.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faragens.
The European diplomat explained recently that because the EU is so deeply involved in the various crises that not all of them are the cause of their own, some Member States have failed to implement the central agenda of Britain, which is full of grants and disturbing changes to agreements that these countries do not want most.
At the annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Union of Professional Unions decided that it would not want them if they were to rob social protection.
We could even call it Daven and George's selfish agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of State will delay the summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capital cities, take pictures of themselves in front of a famous local memorial with or without a local observer, and will then come home to say that they will win support for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the UK's EU border, "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin, suggests that the shortest ministers and officials in certain cities are now at such a point that they don't care about us then.
Germany's cautious and malleable connector Angela Merkel is a member of the Union, but has been active for 10 years and wants to leave his or her work before it goes to play the same way as it has been for too long for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has been re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's got the power to lose.
On the other hand, there may be a national legal administration, a left-hand person in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing for self-employed people, when their energy would be more driven to prevent them from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to do so because of similar separatist attitudes.
So, my friend would point out that some of these ministers can even knowingly plan to make unfavourable comments to the national party of Scotland, the type of Ison-British national campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renewal negotiations had been arranged" and "Renewal negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have been given a terrible test of how still the Fleet Street press is able to be, and how the EU-Special Journal alone were not, during the 1975 referendum of Tony Benn, when our membership began to be confirmed by resolution 2:1.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Europortonist, who named himself by writing "EU direct bananas" as a writer in Brussels at the beginning of the 90th century.
Ed Miliband may have been a hero, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
To them, a group of tax collectors, telephones, and people whose home is specifically different and who own most of our best words.
Tony Blair actually thought of them exactly the same, but he realized that if you're in trouble with the gorilla, the bananas must be released because of the confusion, if you want to be on the gorilla lunch list and later on the day.
In fact, Miliband was more liberal than Blair himself, which is going to be opposed to Cameroon's renegotiation of negotiations.
I've never given him an apology before.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who had kindly deceived me in the Westminster Parliamentary Chamber on Monday (I told him that he no longer has time to bother me), would appear to be in danger of reoccuping Neil Kinnock's 80th generation with Murdochia, which was wrong and now.
Although it may take time, however, she needs to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not to me, but to Andrew Marriin, who went to BBC headquarters in Corby on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, as beautiful as it is, developing.
He says he would like us to remain in the EU.
Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom's own self-determination side of the U.S. Army and the Conservative Party's leading national leaders can certainly be based on this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said on both radio and TV this week, when her internal partner would have wanted to admit that Corby's choice to call Karski John McDonnell as Minister of State Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70th anniversary of his father's TV show, trying to be an unreasonable part of his government colleagues without going so far as to lose his place of government.
Hillary's surfaces were more impressive.
But for the sake of the fight to remain with "where it is good" - the Benn resolution - was not what McDonnell said, and not at all what Corby told the heads and citizens at a private meeting on Monday morning.
Whatever the unexplained, emotional and personal image Corby wants to focus (remember that he even cares about me), the freedom of communication is important during the time of the environmental survey TV, and in particular on social media routes, which are essential for the growth of HIV/AIDS and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair to fail to give Cameron a European air traffic ticket by allowing him to support the part-time work in the national voting campaign.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
However, McDonnelly and Corbyn's basic review of EU membership (and, in line with their Benn-Hungarian economy and their anti-capital history) is no longer difficult to discuss with some of the left-wing thinkers, whose small differences in Narcissism is a central topic in educational research.
As for his two-year-old relationship with Naton (Tom Watson has since made sure that Corby's campaign is not to be supported), a foreign diplomat must only try to explain it to the head.
Why would Paris or Berlin support the granting of political capital (they are also inconceivable voters) to Britain when it can be completely worthless?
The United States has already failed to break the British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in terms of cost-effective conservation management, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticised public Health England’s electronic package evaluation
Researchers have said that the State’s financial authority’s claim that the electricity packages are 95 % less harmful than traditional has been initiated by the meeting of 12 spirits, which involved links to the tobacco industry.
The experts who wrote the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to use the public Health England (PHE) evidence in their reports on electricity.
The PHE would publish this "virtant” report last month in a picture of it as "considerable as evidence material".
However, many researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and have referred to the relationship between some experts and tobacco industry.
The medical release of Lancet would have been published in the last month, in which the main decision of the PHE was against the "extraordinary rapid background" decision.
Two other researchers writing in BMJ have reasoned whether the claims are "constructed to a price or to a price."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, professor of European Public Health Martin McKee, and Professor of Liverpool’s clinical epidemiology, Simon Capewell, say: “The primary health principles of cancer are that they must establish a proven effectiveness.”
They say that the general expectation of the PHE's claim that "the best estimate of electricity packages is about 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco" is based on a detailed assessment and sampling of the substance.
In fact, it is one of the 12 persons meeting where a multi-responsibility analysis (MCDA) was developed to generate their opinions on the diseases that are linked to various nicotine-consuming products and the results of this meeting were clarified for research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously informed by the president of the funding I received for independent research from the British American Tobacco company.
He also supported the national health authorities of the Bat in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting reported that they had received funding from the power plant manufacturer, but not from the funds he was told to receive earlier from Philip Morris International, they were increasing.
The panel's members' electoral principles are not stated, but the panel is composed of a number of well-known support providers, some of whom are also included in the study of the funding received from the panel.
Other places have not been known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE smoking director.
The group's study "professionally endorses", that there is a lack of "invasive evidence for most of the problems of product and most of the criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the report of the PHE.
McKee and Capewell say that the PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that the electricity package acts as a resort to smoking in children or non-infectionists" are early.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health and well-being of the PHE, says that the claims made in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electronic packages are much less dangerous than burning."
Half of those burned alive will die because of their dependence.
All evidence points to the relatively small health risks associated with the power supply, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when smoking is so much public ignorance compared to the relative risks.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds per year.
By explaining the present evidence - even if the electrical packages are not safe - their problems are just part of the natural smoking diseases - we fulfill our national responsibility.
BBC would like permission from East Enders, says former Channel 4 leader.
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programs such as East Enders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "say anything" about such delays as this site dedicated to Albert Square.
Johnson said that the commitments should be used only for programmes that other British postal operators are not doing.
He criticized BBC for setting up public service programmes that probably have a lower generality, a more difficult time to send against the most competitive programs and channels such as BBC4.
After President Tony Hall told the company to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he had to create a six-year relationship with the BBC at the time of Channel 4.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programmes that would clearly fit for non-subsidised competitors," Johnson pointed out to the upper room communications committee as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the pledge is held - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or for a long time - it should at least limit its production to programs that other people don't do and do.
The Voice will be sent at the most important time, because it will want to recover as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would look like a program is a joke, it's funny, it's obviously a joke.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could also be financed without State support.
The Voice is one such and the East Enders is the other, without a ban on the house inside.
In direct terms, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand what it's like to be sent to public service.
I don't think it's going to weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4 led by historian Johnson said that BBC is responsible for forest logging "because of the objectives of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series, reflecting the comments of former Skyn leader Tony Ballin, who used his 2003 MacTaggart in Edinburgh to propose that BBC sell lines such as East Enders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public service programmes "are going to BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but BBC is thus filling its area of responsibility and can then, in the face of its 4 billion pledges, tell the whole thing, 'surely, we'll do all these unknown programs that no one sees'.
They'll put them in a place where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the payment, Johnson said to the Committee: "I would like to ask you to look for a more aggressive system in which you will be able to answer the most.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 points a year will get a lot of answers, but I don't know if it's for people with 150 pounds of money because they don't use BBC much.
Former Skyn and Channel 5: Chairman David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee to be silent, said that the BBC should reassess its former role in "information, training and speeding".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that there are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from Australian and Canadian public radios and change the form of "information, selection and delay".
As to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he considers only on television, and associated with commercial companies so that they are all visible on the network.
"Snipples" enables brain control by means of sound signals
The video shows how the angles change direction as soon as the sound pulse reaches them.
Researchers have developed visuals that have genetically modified nervous systems to guide them through voice waves.
The tiny convulsions change quickly as they form a voice impulses, which are too high to hear human voice.
The impulses operate by connecting genetically modified commercial cells that have reacting to ultrasounds.
Subject: Researchers read and write mental activity in the light of light
Researchers said that the brains show the function of a new, voice-generative, method, which is beyond which certain brain, heart and body organs can be activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a study of the Salk Institute in California, La Jolla, told The Guardian that one day the method can replace brain stimulation. It is an invasive measure in which human brains are led to electrical pumps to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The mussels didn't normally react to their ultrasound, but Chalasa found that when they were surrounded by a nest with a microscopic little ball, the situation changed.
He noticed that the cubes strengthened ultrasounds that then walked inside the eyes.
The confirmed ultrasounds affect the TRP-4 ionicaves, structures that are in some visual cells.
The ancestors will be able to open and activate these ionized cells attached to them, as reported in the publication of Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasound-guided contaminants, Chalasani genetically shaped the eyes so that part of them are TRP-4-ionic.
When Chalasani used ultrasounds, the microscopes strengthened the sound waves and directed them to the muscles where they connected the formed traffic signals.
The procedure has the same dimensions as in the optogenetic, irradiated tool, which gives scientists the ability to link neurons to and out of the air pumps.
However, Chalasani says that the use of somnolence may be somewhat more beneficial than the use of optogenetics.
Unlike the light that has to be sent from the optic to the deep inside the brains, the ultrasounds can travel through the skin without delay, so they can be sent to the brains on the neck.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible to get the human brain to respond temporarily to ultrasound in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-produced salts, he added.
I'm going to put a pressure device on your house.

These 300 publications are the works of artists who were working at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped to publish newspapers around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. There is a six-point package of six-inch six-cool vessels, which, according to the collective, "have access to a third of the whole planet's bus station store".
Transport for London is not interested in this incredible "publicism".
A Special Patrol Group collection of paradigms.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex newspaper Gavin Grindon, artists ask more and want to bring political work to the public outside the gallery.
Many artists have started working with activists in response to the idea that they must go abroad if they want their art to affect society.
The opposite of the arms trade is healthy on an unworked metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the last 24 hours by Facebook. It was created free of charge by VCCP, and also by graphic designers and designers.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the positions were never mentioned - and also in the exCeLin calendar were then empty - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were thinking more realistic about the reputation of a corrupt corporation, but "it was more persistent to stress things with church colors and animation".
"They've done great work to help us raise questions about non-legislative entertainment," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the government of the United Kingdom must take action and ensure that the equipment is not sold illegally near our home.
Perhaps it comes from ExCeL in the context of the creation of art when manufacturers trade beautiful products.

Eight golden rules for living in a student-associated institution
It's been 11 years since I was an unknown 19-year-old who changed to a student school. Then I believed in barrets and moral relativism, but now I remember people's violent smiles - and numerous, long complaints from others.

Your room should be a comfortable place, but in many apartments, it is a different culture that is friendly, social and leads to lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who's trying to sleep.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say "I love you and want to be your friend, but now you have to remove that I can restore the energy I spent talking to you".
Try to figure out when the student's roommate is tired of socialism, and maybe send her to the door in text instead of knocking.
I've been thinking about getting together when the talk came up.
One type of student in my classroom was thinking that if the door wasn't locked, he would have been invited inside.
He saw a lot of stories.
You'll be in touch with your friends.
Because you're starting the university at the top of the ceiling, people's knocking on the door with the chocolate solution, and the presentation of yourself is somewhat strange, less "comes to the neighborhood, I'm going to tell you something, now that I ask you personal questions" -50-ly.
Offering self - sacrificing gifts is a wonderful way to cultivate friendship.
Your roommates try to be responsible for talking, and it may be that they will continue to combine your growth into a smiley surprise.
It's true that it's up to you to be able to handle it.
Injury-skinned sugars are likely to only get people to sleep when you get up.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking someone's feet off is stealing, but what if you just take some kind of milk?
Ask and check the owner of the country.
It's quite possible that they will give you a promise, even if they're stuck inside.
If someone steals your case, it's embarrassing, and you get my sympathies, but try to treat it older than my roommate, who's trying to punish those who steal it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to be so confused that people don't get tired or studied.
It's not just being a decent person, but because you're like that little cat in the back of the word.
The girl who used me asked her neighbors if they could call the drum and bass music later because the clock was three in the morning and she had a tent in the morning.
The response was to increase voice capacity.
When they were finally late at 5: 00 a.m., the girl kindly gave them two hours to hide her music, closed her door, and went into a three - hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future partner was tempted to change the same apartment with you?
Or, on the other hand, would it not be incredible if you were to be part of your future partner, you would be united, separated, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your common friendship with him.
Of course, my heart wants what you want, but if my roommate is not really your future partner, you can even try to talk your point of view.
At the crucial moment, when you notice that someone has left his door open, there is more danger than it affects the distance between his room, the interface and the temptation.
Good game is fun, but it's back in time.
You can provide useful and funeral instruction for safety by hiding something... but never fight any room with teeth and shampoo.
Open their doors and shut the doors to the waters that you then put into the packaging, but don't care about their property on the snowy side of the roof as much as twice as they can.
The Nazi village of the home of foreign students in Kitelä - The house designed as a reception center was demolished in Salo
In the mornings, a racist scene was held at the homes of foreign students in the Northern Karjala.
In other words, as the police told me earlier, there are no accommodations for temporary asylum seekers, but longer in Finland, the pensions of foreign citizens, says Heidi Luukkainen, professor of the National University of China.
The windows and the walls of the National Library's accommodation style were decorated with racist marks, such as the hackers, and one of the hotel's windows had a metal display, says the East Suomen police.
According to Luukkas, the responsibility teacher of social education for young people in the National Library was estimated at ten people during the construction.
"It was a weekend and adults were free to move, so the part could be different," Loukainen says.
The National Court has hosted people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already in Finland for some time former students as well as newly arrived asylum seekers.
There are a-stamps in all the buildings in the fighting building.
Part studies in adult education, part in professional studies, and part studies in Finnish", the Finnish story.
The status A has been so stated as to grant a continuing residence permit that can be granted for four years once in Finland for a time before being a foreigner.
The East Suomen police were investigating the case as a crime of rape and domestic violence.
According to the article, the information provided for students on the ground was maintained, where there was also a need for translation.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," says Luukianen.
According to the legend, the battle has already been ripped off the wall.
In fact, there were at least three men who were suspected of moving in a car.
I think this is the main point of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
It's nothing more serious," Loukain says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
Killed last week.
It was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday morning.
The hospital wall was limited by a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02. Corrected policy information on the age and status of the people in the building.
The state stops Y-Jonna Karjaal - tourists near, "Idiotting"
The Y-Junna to go to Raasepor Karjaal will stop walking in March.
The news highlighted the passengers rising to the beginning of the journey through the Helsinki border.
In particular, the bottom line is on the sandy ground, says Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the village.
Idiots, because living standards are growing all the time and work they need to contact Helsinki quickly and conveniently.
This can't be anything other than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström tells HSTV's challenge video even if it comes to the main city of tractor.
In addition, New Zealand also has some side effects.
The H- and R-units will be re-united as R-line.
The position of the powder in Järvene and Nuppulna Nuusulna will be removed from use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR have published, as a matter of fact, information on how the Ministry of Transport purchases communications under the following contract.
The scope of the contract varies between the year and the routes to be stopped are throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded will be approved by the Committee on Finance later.
Bengtström considers that the State border is short-lived.
We will make the same mistakes as we did before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be a fall.
Y-turns also use other than racepolitical and sensitivists, because it is fast and ends many positions.
The Espoola of Anna Pöyry was delayed by the city area for longer on the road.
"It's a bad name for those who have to plan their trip again," he said in the rush of Y-Y.
It's a little easier.
There is a new link to the border between the Y-Jun in the Helsing Sea (HSL) region, which will be replaced by the name of the Church.
This will increase the costs for HSL, in practice for the king of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now able to identify different options and their impact on service and lip price," HSL deliverer Suvi Richtniemi said.
It is still impossible to assess costs accurately.
The Board of Directors says that the HSL based on the number of passengers has paid from the Y-turn for a million years, the ministry has much more to do with this.
The next R line will leave two positions between them.
Instead, the number of uniforms is doubled in Ainolas and Saunakalius.
There are 28 small positions and numerous corridors all over the country.
The Ministry no longer buys a train from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapämäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensu is to be reduced to the resort of the Pieksääki-Warkaus.
The young people are reduced by trains in Rihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Katka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year will be made during the period when the total purchase of travel by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to provide 12.3 million annual stocks to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixth Korkman wrote in the book The Age of Päoma: "Marx's support for family"
The global economic crises have taken place on the surface of Karl Marxin (1818-1883) and, in 1867-1894, published in his Opinion of the Head of the SKP, writes in a book published today by Yrjö Hakan.
"They are now taken more seriously than for a long time," writes Hakan in his president's office.
Marx's assessments of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and convergence have increasingly shown the growing role of capital in all areas of life, focusing on capital, and the growing role of capital and mental capital have proved to be surprising.
The author of the book based on the Master Seminars is also a professor of the Aalto University, a respected economic operator, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is a temporary "now and forever".
However, is not the former director of the Ellkein Life Research Institute and the Ellkein Life Administration a Marxist?
I'm not.
On the phone, Korkma says that she does not consider Marx as a temporary economic operator, but rather as an interesting community theory.
Social data have been distinguished and specialized today, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political seeker, and literary clocks.
"The usual point is that the history of the past tells us the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's prophecies went mad.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the capitalist beginnings too far, on the ground of Korkman.
But Korkman sees value in the radicalization of Marx.
"The most important thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing Marxin's interests, such as the sharing of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a great picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical reflection," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
In his view, capitalism was an unexpected case, which should only end.
However, Marx is supporting Korkman's view of marriage.
"In '70s Marxia couldn't read," Korkman says.
"Maalas and Trotslings and others hated all capitalism, but more to each other."
Today's debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also be approached without the ideology and political pressures of the years.
"Every sociologist should get to know Marx's thinking world - like other classics," Korkman says.
The UN requires military courts in Sri Lanka
The UN requires the establishment of a Special Court of Justice to investigate military actions carried out in the Sri Lankan internal group, the AFP reports.
The United Nations report on the use of the internal war between 1983 and 2009 was published in the medium term after a long break.
The report accuses the military of both the Sri Lankan army and the Taliban.
In Sri Lanka, at least 100,000 people are estimated dead.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the large number of armed forces in the last few months of the war should be examined carefully, as required by the UN report.
Sri Lanka’s military forces were reported to be responsible for torture, rape, and systematic sexual violence, which was probably the same as that of men and women.
According to the report, the capinals have been accused of imputing children and children to war.
Both parties have been charged with the murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it was going to conduct its own investigation, but it is not going to allow for the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
A social media in England has been targeted in the y-axis
There was a long foreign language, which was English in the main language, on Wednesday afternoon.
The English sciences tested more than 16,000 cokes.
In the trial, it was possible to write the material on social media.
On the basis of their own experience, we had to determine whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
On the other hand, the English text of 150 to 250 words could show the content of the website to the viewer.
The search was Dear Agony Anunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leelian beauty.
He was asked how the parents should look at things for young people as well.
All the subjects of the substance were four, one of which was to be selected.
"It was hard of them," considered the third theme of the English edition of Parvoo in Swedish, Mia Lybeck.
In the third issue, only the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barrosol, was appointed.
The four things were very nice for Lybeck again.
It was supposed to write about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have been trained to write books," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole test "as normal".
In the English or Swedish trial, questions were answered about texts, such as adaptation to climate change and the treatment of large computers.
The average week was also written by some large Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spain (27).
Syksyn's letters continue as a spring, where there is a second house, or a Swedish or Finnish trial.
The tests are organised normally, which is not affected by the attitude of employees.
The University of Applied Sciences will invite experts to seek suitable travel connections in time so that they can be tested.
Additional time can be obtained if it can show that delay has not been caused by its own indifference.
In the valley, trade was stolen by gun
In the village, trade was stolen on Wednesday morning in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the thief had been dragged into dark clothes and raised to hide the command belt.
He's a normal guy, and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff and received a small sum of money.
Let's look at this as a bunch of thefts.
Police are dedicated to reaching tens of thousands of commentators in Helsinki - support parties other than Finland
In response to the government's interruption decisions, the opinion will be to support the Helsinki debate on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, there are even tens of thousands of people in the area.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTK associations will meet at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in an opinion.
In addition to providing warnings and other police services, it is the duty of the working police to ensure that the waste is disposed of.
Roads leading to railway stations are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30 a.m. to 14 hours.
Only alerts will be delivered to the area.
From the direction of the route of the journey to the direction of the route of the route of the route of the river, from the direction of the west to the Mannerheim.
Do you have enough people on the Helsinki police station, Lieutenant Seppo Kujala?
Second, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a position on the police's job interview.
According to Helsinki, the result of the opinion was that the parties from Finland had come from Finland.
I don't want to tell the police the exact number of the party.
"Some kind of blood is coming, but we're usually going to end up with our own," Kujala says.
The police are asking us to avoid a private car in central Helsinki on Friday.
The figure estimates that the bad transport contract is being carried out at Hakanei's level at the nuclear center.
Fixed transport is expected from the beginning of the morning.
On the other hand, there are a lot of busy buses in Helsinki from other Finnish viewpoints.
They're not going to be delivered to the Railways.
The buses will be on the way to the end of the day.
The finals will then go to the point of opinion," Kujala tells us.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
From the policy point of view, there's a positive side.
The question of mobility of transport, which is normally addressed at these large gatherings, is now being addressed in part.
The authorities have informed the police that Helsinki may become ten thousand economic policy opponents of the government.
The police expect peace of mind to ease.
It's either normal employees or unemployed people. It's normal citizens.
The Finnish intelligent and peaceful people in the circle are "The figure is true.
In different parts of Finland, local opinions are also organised on Fridays.
In many ways, it's exceptional in the past. Do you remember these laws and opinions?
In many ways it is interesting and exceptional to organize a great deal of thought during the summer of the trade unions.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskyl, Emertus Martti Siisiäenen.
It's not surprising you're protesting.
If it hadn't, it would have raised my hands in front of the government, Siseiheinen would have said.
The very legitimate government has taken steps towards the traditional nuclear domains of Finnish corporateism and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The authorities have no right to a contract.
There's a lot of evidence here that ay-mates are really trying to get a gun.
At the same time, the ay movement has a place to look at the cover.
For example, gambling is needed because the ay movement does not necessarily have support for every employee in the past.
The new is now the division of the church which will receive an opinion in the group which the ay would want to take part in the opinion statement.
The unemployed from different sides of Finland expressed their opinion at the press conference in November 1993.
If the Member States were to seek out a comparison, it could be a reference to unemployment, as Murrostorst said in 1993.
Between the heart of the country, Murrostorsta, organized in the middle of a total of 20,000 jobs.
Esko Ahon (center) government corrupts labour market crises to another.
It was said that the interest of the Finnish Government and the employers' organizations had never been as bad as during Aho's tax administration.
Now the government and the ay movement may be even worse than Murrostorsta's times.
In addition, there is now a very high level of security in Finland, Sisienen says.
The current Government College is still interested in the fact that it is so well justified in spite of fundamentals.
There were some elements of the old trade movement in the winter.
The site is expected to be visited by several thousand commentators on Friday.
The media also stop public transport and possibly closes daily and schools.
Even if the pensioner’s pensioner’s income is not shared, it can last for many years.
There have been some 300 opinions in Helsinki last year.
They're on display.
Naturally, in Finnish ay movement opinions have been very peaceful - even though they have been tested in recent years.
Naturally, in the Finnish opinion, conflict is avoided, being legal.
Opinionmakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisianian says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
A culture of thought changed.
The EU membership forced farmers to throw their cannons off and the police managed to get on top of it.
In 1998, the palace collapsed for three months.
There were also visible flights, including flights and pilots.
Do you remember these laws and opinions?
Metal and electricity from the 1970s
The most significant lakes in the 1970s were metal lakes in 1971 and power and electricity in 1977.
There were 70,000 metals involved in the metallic rock.
The Act was suspended by seven weeks after the presentation of the Société d'étégé d'été d'état.
The metal fields were 16 percent of the payroll.
In the summer of 1977, the electricity supply lasted 49 days, causing electricity to rise across the country.
Murrostorsta in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to show their appreciation for the work.
The Palo people settled for three months in 1998
The palace was one of the tallest in the 1990s if I did not have a royal law.
Vulnerables against the EU 1994 and 1999
In 1994 the police were protesting farmers against the EU.
"Syperia teaches, the EU stops," said one of the schools.
The farmers in Spain had to climb to the south.
The 1999 Helsinki EU summit also gave farmers protest and fuel to the European Union in front of the summit.
In 1983 and 1995, care providers were in a position to raise awareness of the situation.
The hospital staff lived for about a month in 1995.
For the first time, they were in law in 1983.
In 1995, several deaths occurred during the law.
I'm threatening you at the law and at the recruiting of caregivers in 2007.
The threat of mobilisation was finally accelerated by negotiations.
Doctors were lactating in 2001
"Doctors in law - demand," said a doctor in the school year 2001.
The number of public health centres and hospitals has lasted for five months and has been discussed in the past for some time on how the courts can threaten the safety of the patient.
After the act, the public sector received doctors' wages.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students from the Senate in Helsinki for the March study in 2013.
The Central Police will find the refugees filled with Finnish refugees to the Italian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in resolving the floods of the registered refugee regime in Finland.
On Sunday, the Italian police stopped at Aisterheim near the German border, which had 42 blocks.
The file doesn't exist, if there was a river on the way to Finland.
They were all right on the ice cream line.
We've had an exchange of information with the Italian police.
The study and responsibility are in an event-by-case place in Italy, told the Central Police Commissioner Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, it became more and more difficult for the refugees who were traveling on the aid of a freight car in Italy.
By then all 71 passengers in the area were apparently killed by aid.
In cooperation with the Italian police, according to the first report, the river belongs to the Finnish subsidiary.
The company operates, inter alia, the food business and its delivery director is an outsider, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Hungry captain, former drug dealer and former trafficker - the story of the five secret transporter
A king of secretaries, a violent Russian, a typographical messenger, and a taxi to remain good for himself.
For example, such people practice human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trent, and the supplier Giampaolo Musumec, have met and challenged ten secretaries and these "clients" and, by writing their letter, the Death Travel Office will show its face this week.
In the book, they present the keys to human trafficking, present solutions, and present secretaries from various ports of business.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The mountain ranges of the Tunisian coast are not attracting foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there to the Mediterranean.
For the sake of their settlement, the islands are also particularly suitable for transport, since the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in El Attayan's village, lives in Emir, in the kitchen, my captain and the father of six children.
The shells are famous for their catch, but the fisherman is more productive to drive people.
It's been done by Emir in a blue, ten-metre tree with hundreds of stories already.
If the Russian seal is full, it's 40 people.
On one trip, Emir will travel some 8 000 euros after costs.
Emily has five of her clients looking for her clients around Tunisia.
Customers will get from many countries, but during the Arab era, a large number of Tunisians wanted to give up their lives.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis resurfaced.
Customers will be able to get from manter to Kerkenna-Sarar in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers just stay alive.
The housing will pay about 75 euros per night, and if the customer ends up in the middle, it is their problem.
We're going to the water in the middle of a short walk.
On the first night, we are taken out of the islands, then we are stopped, waiting for the day and going to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes it's hard to sail, and on the lowlands 20 meters, passengers are crying and jumping.
On arrival, the human body has been evacuated for hours, and Emir is going back to the airport.
Emir wants her to be scared.
As a result, he is slowing down and at least claiming to be a beginner of the spirit.
He says in the book that once the police chased him, he threw all his passengers across the street and ordered them to the nearest island.
"I found customers in private and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers will come from southern Sahara.
He's got to hear about this.
I'll get rid of them right away.
They need to see who's counting here right now.
I don't know. I don't know.
Goran is a typical taxi in Bogovada, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. It's a start engine that's been running the last time, and it's probably seen the best day of her life.
However, it is important for Goran customers to move over the taxi and move towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovavavava is a small village some 60 kilometers from Belgrade on the coast.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next door to the street, where families are mainly saved.
In the middle of the desert, without family family, men travel to live in tents, in squares and in abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families in the desert who have not left their asylum application in Serbia for a reason or another reason.
Some people also live in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Goran's team found most of their customers.
These are often recently renewed - through the Balkans, the journey requires a large number of crossings and weekly journeys in a difficult country, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When we finally reach the Bogovád region, the great point of human trafficking, people are dying.
Goran's natives are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and it's enough," Goran complains.
He says the Africans are trying to be strong.
Goran doesn't like it.
You can hear the whole trip.
First, the price will be adjusted for example EUR 300, then they will calculate it by 200 and offer it at the end of 150.
Goran highlights being a nice man and welcoming him.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran will tell his work to be done worse than others and to calculate his request to the Hungarian border for only EUR 50.
The trip is three hundred kilometers, most of which is comfortable with the engine.
The colleagues will ask for a three or four price.
Goran owes about EUR 50 000 per year.
It's not a large amount for the consignor, but it's a very pleasant anniversary in Serbia.
Serbia has determined that the taxis are not allowed to travel 12 kilometres closer to the border of Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the schools and takes him from the edge of his village's head.
Then he shows the customers the right direction and withdraws.
On board work
From 35 years of age, the Congolese is called a Messenger, and it is not just a favorite name.
In fact, he has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there is a great deal of religious pressure from Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese children.
In addition to the message, the Messenger is driving around a secret bus where people are moving from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the painting job.
It's important to make the message look good.
He has a number of times a day to cool his neck, and I have to be careful that white cataracts are gently circling through the dark night of the rats.
It is a success of the new Mercedes, of its agricultural car and of its three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not send a message, he arranges for people from Congo to Uganda and ahead of Europe.
The client starts calling from a number five of the Messenger's phone number.
He recommends that the border be on foot in the morning, hide the money visually, and cross the border with traders.
In order to obtain a asylum seeker or a refugee status, the Ugandan authorities should be informed that there is a home for example in North Kivun war zones and that they have had to remove violence from their home.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, a Messenger will arrange a new identity for the client.
Old personality certificates will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
This will help the Messenger's contacts in Uganda police.
Thereafter, the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application procedure, the establishment of civil organisations, at the end of UNHCR.
A messenger is aware of bureaucracy because he has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He will consider each step separately: leaving an application for Ugandan police will pay about a hundred euros, processing documents to humanitarian organisations, and changing processes, for example, to some European countries, for example, EUR 4,500-7 000.
Follies and ice creams
Tom's a beginner, a former drug dealer.
A four-year-old Irish daily on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to have people on the streets on his way to Britain.
He has an Afghanian, French taxi and ten bicycles in London, who do not even know that he is in the passenger bus.
At night Tom and the taxi reached their client, usually from 2-3 people, something from Calais' discussion.
They're driving the A26 engine and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped by the car, Tom and the driver would have to arrange for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
To stop, Tom runs a customer's engine over to a quiet place where some people sleep before the canal's boy goes to Brittany.
Tom's choosing a suitable team - he must make sure it's on his way to England and not even to the Netherlands, and he's gonna cut off a security guard.
It's gotta be quiet so they can wake up.
Sometimes something's involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the trip is clear, Tom hits his client with aluminium foil, the same as that which is wrapped in the kitchen around the kitchen or around the kitchen.
It should prevent the police's heat from detecting hiding agents.
Some use the same currency for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the river and leaves the place hoping that no one will stop the peacekeepers at any time before Britain.
King of the Salaculators
Muammer Little is one of the world's most famous human artists.
Of the Turkish people, it has been called the master of the market and the king of the illegal trade in the Mediterranean, which governs the maritime routes from Turkey to the EU, mainly Greece and Italy.
The small has worked since the 1990s and has continuously developed new secret transport methods.
He also has a competitive view of other entrepreneurs: he demands money from the bank.
One of the new methods is to rent Turkish ports for a few days to tourists in the United States or European families.
In fact, ships are loaded directly with Syrian, Iraqi, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000 for the first time in Istanbul to land and from there to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stocks, for example in old industrial departments, until the time comes.
People are being forced into minibuses, and they're going somewhere on the beach.
They are secretly commanded in the group of growth and are expected to be marked.
When it is given, the ship must rise quickly.
Travelers must stay all the way under cover.
The seafarer can only observe how deep the ship is, because other signs of the human race are not visible.

In the south, transport is organized by at least hundreds and Küczk is estimated to be worth millions.
He takes into account the purchase of land by secret companies, the medical industry, and over a hundred homes he rents.

After that, he's obviously gone.

The American Olympics tell their book about their disease and their becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, a 500 - foot - [500 m] jurist, Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has aroused interest in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton describes the end of his career as a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated page would publish a series of books on diamonds.
Favor Hamilton decided to take his urn to Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the casinos at the summit and went to the casinos for the second time.
But in the finals, he had to panic.
He immediately began to climb up the hill and defends his place of leadership in the country.
However, 150 meters before the ground, his power disappeared.
He broke down on the street, and other competitors stopped him after each other.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I took myself over the painting line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from two months of mental disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney had committed suicide, and he himself experienced great hardships.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when he ran into a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There were no economic problems in Paris, but he refused to get money from having sex with his neighbors.
She also spoke to her husband to approve of her actions.
Favor Hamilton's tax was 450 euros per hour.
He's telling me he's using the money to fly.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s prostitution in his career was that he had acquired the same adrenal trades as he had been in a public security competition.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a two-hundred brain disorder.
The first two-year anniversary of the event appeared at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun published its article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics of Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1,500 feet [3,57,40 m] long in the world's statistics, but remained in Sydney’s Olympics for the last time.
When I joined the Norwegian Hygiene Group, I said, "Surorian"
King Petter Northug of Norway has exceeded the limits of compatibility in at least one of his colleagues' opinion.
Northug and Norway's Hygiene League have been indicted for the last year by the game agreement.
Although the association has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, this has not been achieved by many world masters and Olympic champions.
As a result of the Treaty, the Norwegian Federation decided to close Northhug’s future World Cup.
The decision was given thanks to the two-fold World Master Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he'd be happy to join me in the show.
"Thank you for showing kindness," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We can't afford that one activist can avoid working for the Union sponsor," he continued.
There is a financial gap between the Norwegian Federation and Northug.
Northug would obviously want to be part of a long rural group so that he could report his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an association that also takes care of future generations and does not give one of the players.
At the same time, he recalled that the association has given Northug both economic and other rights for many years.
I know it because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't agree that one athlete has exactly different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug would certainly publish his own report, which assured him that he wanted to play in the colors of Norway for the first time in the world as well as then in the MM-kiss and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won all six MM medals, of which two gold.
He was in the last winter in Falun in the winning team.
Expiry date is also issued in Northern Ireland
On Thursday, 25.9., there will be a series of riots in various restaurants and shops for which the campaign of passengers has been granted.
The aim of the day is to raise Finland's high level of food production and lower the level of departure from the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the rock as a high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital city, but the independent operator's audits and classifications of top-puravents are located around Finland.
The international attention to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing awareness of competition and of the organisation.
In the northern part of the day, there will be a restaurant in the Vasa in the Fund and in the Cantarelli.
The day of the contest at the school is part of the restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has also been decided to make one of the most important international events organized by the organization during the same day across the world.
Finland will continue to remain in the country of residence.
Letter of appeal: Establishment of the reception centre for criminal proceedings
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are currently owned by the LSK Business Park Oy, in cooperation with the reception centre for refugees.
According to the claim, the region continues to have a sustainable crisis of critical infrastructure, which is a defence force and its co-operation partner, namely, Finland's Special Network Oy.
The complainant's letter tells us that the establishment of the reception centre would constitute a significant safety risk, which is not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the Chancellor, the defence authorities may have the interests associated with the former Air Force School and the airport, which have not been so affected by the preparation of the reception centre.
The case shows that in the case of the Gaza Strip, negotiations have been held over the past two years on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of a possible external operator to the airport.
The issue has been discussed, inter alia, with the Ministry of Defence, Mr Jussi Ninistung (p.) and the National President of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
A private person shall ensure that there is no objection to the reception centre in the proceedings, but that the intended location in the previous reserve area is wrong.
In the last few days, the city administration has dealt with reception centres.
Nationality: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the East Sea region
The Government means that there are essential conditions for farmers and the present, as well as for the rapporteurs of all the representatives of the representatives of the Republic of Montenegro.
According to the President, all participants were concerned about the management of the refugee camp.
He considers it valuable that the government and the opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the most credible issues.
Especially during this time when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to the report, the situation in Syria, as well as in Russia and the United States, can also have an impact on Ukraine and beyond the situation in the East Sea region.
This is an important aspect of the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the future of the East Sea.
According to the report, the question of Nato was also addressed in the discussions.
In the labour market situation, the president did not take the position.
Finnair flew 16 domestic planes, Alkot held for several hours
One flight is already set up as a tortoise and 15 minutes.
The list of abandoned flights is available on Finnair's website.
In Finland, it is said that the activities of airports are aimed at addressing the pre-primary authority during the labour situation.
However, courage and delay are expected for security checks and other services.
The message of opinion closes the doors of the Helsinki Centre
In the spring, the opinion will close the doors of Helsinki's debate.
The police tell the Railways to be closed by car at 9.30 a.m.-14.
Cars are not rescued from the direction of the mannerheims, Postikata, and not from the route to the railway station.
From the direction of the Union of Hakanei, transport is directed to the Union Road at the point of entry into the port of Kaisanjeni.
According to the policy, the time of closure depends on the amount of violence involved in the opinion statement.
Only alerts are delivered to the area.
Metro- and ratites throughout the day in the country of thought
Operators of the Metro and Railway Vehicles participate in the afternoon at the start of the sub-modal transport at the end of the night.
The association of the railway and metro personnel reported on the matter to the STT at night.
The majority of Sources will be closed for two hours, including posts closed
In the past, mental confusion also causes disturbances to the postal services.
Significant delays are expected, inter alia, for day-to-day distribution.
Part of the mail service is closed.
The blood circulation of the Finnish Red Cross is treated without charge.
It is also intended to treat hospital shipments and laboratory procedures.
You can get information about the services from the Mail website.
Most of Finland's Alkos are closed on Friday for two hours.
Pam has instructed his employees to suspend work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also invited the staff of the retail trade to participate in the opinion of professional organisations.
The representatives of the SOK and of the Central Bank point to Helsinki Sanom to try to keep the sellers open when necessary.
According to the Commission, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual trades.
Helsing's daily house is partially closed
Helsing's daily homes do not work full-time on Fridays, reports the Helsinki Bureau of Early Ageing.
As a result of the opinion of professional organisations, day-care may be focused on certain dates and not on the organisation of day-to-day and sporting activities.
Environmental requirements for day-to-day housing and groups of developing and multiple children remain open.
In addition, day-to-day activities of the most developed and audiovisual schools are organised normally.
The Agency shall be authorised to inform the Agency of any changes in its activities tomorrow.
Median researchers: Sipila takes a real risk
According to Silip, there is a need for multiple channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel in the other group.
We also need to continue this direct speech channel.
This won't be the last time, Sipile told the suppliers in the community.
The pillar did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are coming.
According to Silip, we don't always have to keep talking on the Ylen channel.
If other channels appear to be a channel, we'll see it then.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipil said.
According to the Spanish authorities, the economic situation in Finland is so serious that it requires citizens to be kept on television and radio.
This fact, which we are now talking about, is time complex and requires a longer basis.
That's why we decided on this channel, Sipila found out.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
Sip takes a great risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipil's TV interview will not tell you more about turning into the government.
Is it an attempt to adopt the definition of public debate more precisely in its own hands and to reject the issues of public debate? Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) is pleased to note that he does not follow the media agenda and does not give it a definition of himself.
On behalf of the democratic debate and the public, I hope that these things do not relate to each other.
I understand that the commercial media has been made aware of Sipil's announcement.
It would be weird if the media girl didn't respond.
The political decision-makers' communications requirements are not a matter of democracy.
The role of media representatives is definitely to strive to avoid the adoption of political agendas.
According to my experience, the TV interview is a great risk to Sipilje.
In order to meet the high expectations set by the speaker, it is appropriate to introduce a new and specific procedure.
Are we offering more today than we've ever heard?
Or can he speak in a different way, in a different way, or in a different way, or say something new?
I wish to say that if the promise is just the same old one, I must wonder why such a great gift was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In general, this risk will be taken into account if there is no special situation in this area but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that the Supreme will become a message of politicians or representatives and government, which is certainly not in line with the interest of the Supreme or the general line.
Slippered door water
In the future, it is also important to highlight what the Prime Minister has to say.
In the evening, we will look at what is missing and what is not, says University of Jyväskyl's research coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
I heard that TV is a door-to-door invitation from Sipil, because this will make it possible to bring your own view to the front without any noises.
This message is given to a large audience without the consent of journalists, but rather than in the media, where suppliers can raise critical questions.
The sword ends the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, it is dangerous that the media interpret something wrong, because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
I heard it's very important how Sipil is shown on TV - the pain in the chest, the release of his hands.
He'll be like Shiphrah, who's now telling the people what to do.
If Sipila is able to present her case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to know something about it, because this person's age is like talking directly to another person.
This (United States President Barack) Obama and the partners regularly celebrate.
A real exception
Policy researcher Erka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to citizens is truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened until decades ago that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the nation.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher considers that the Prime Minister would therefore like to have the Finnishs present in favour.
In the afternoon, employers organise opinions and bills against government action.
Mr Arhimäki, President of the Left Group, says on Twitter that Sipila could keep her speech on the nation's status in the Presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, where she would also be able to discuss it.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (Sd.), once again announces his challenge to Sipil's dialogue.
There's no time for monologists now.
Half a year from the election.
The finals can't be hidden, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy with a necktie has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good shape at the time of his discovery.
The boy was born on Facebook by his father.
The police station in Finland will also confirm the matter for the Night.
The boy went out for four o'clock in the evening.
Later that night, he's lost contact with her.
Father thanks all the people who have helped in the search.
Thank you for the ten connections and findings during these hours.
The update was distributed nearly 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in this short time
The Finnish UFC hit the youth into a violent fight: You get angry
A Kurdish volunteer, Makwan Amirkhan, would publish a video on Facebook, which is particularly inviting immigrants to young people.
Makwan Amirkhani was under pressure to speak against young men's beatings.
Amirkhana, born in Iran and with her family in Finland at five years of age, has won both of his professional training in the UFC's most valued UFC range.
Amirkhani tells her that she received a message asking to see one of the Instagram methods.
They have videos that kill young people with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me she's been deceived by young people.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The rest of the country is hit, sit on the other side, and suddenly you will not think of any of the consequences of this when you do dark videos, the day of the American day.
Harder defenses
Some of the young people who see the video are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner, Jarmo Heinosen has posted video on social media on both immigrants and immigrant youths.
Name's that you're killing your superiors on the way.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish American remembers.
Amirkhana recalls that there are sites in Finland that are looking for immigrants' crimes.
These individuals have become very numerous.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you're still on your way to the country and that you're going to be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhan says.
Amirkhan is inviting young people to remember their neighbors.
If they sometimes have to be a subject of racism, then you can blame yourself.
Now, think about it a couple times before you go along with that, you'll stay.
Amirkhan says violent action is contributing to racism.
You'll get a black time of hate I don't like myself.
You have a bad time, however, and you're not going to do anything better, Amirkhan's decision.
SAK put its position on the storage package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that the employer's organization is on the ground of its position to submit an optional inventory to STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the proposal by STTK on Twitter.
The STTK service organisation told the government that it had submitted its own proposal last Wednesday, which the Prime Minister called for the five-percent rate of productivity to be achieved by the Ruha Sipil (meaning).
The President of the Akavana, Mr Fjader, believes that the Government will accept a proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the biggest payer organization SAK should strengthen its position earlier.
On behalf of the President of the SAK, Mr Lyly, he made a frank comment on the issue on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK's work committee is dealing with this matter on Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK sought solutions to "opening the labour market" and that contracts made by active parties were needed for the position of demand.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Prime Minister of the Government of Cyprus as a social agreement did not apply to SAK.
The previous negotiations on the Community Agreement would be closed when SAK did not agree to undertake a five-percent increase in the productivity objective.
Comment: The big message is dangerous to come up - "I feel it's a little bit boring about the trees"
I feel like it's a little bit boring to keep a woodwork if there's already a comfort paper in the bag, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The sensors change in the payee's order.
Does it mean to shout at a government or even agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's allies cleansed the country's government of hatred.
All of Finland was threatened.
This publication is not for sale.
OAJ's professional organization threatened to shut down schools and day-to-day homes.
As a smoker, OAJ retired: no school or day is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the chairman of the STTKK, Antti Palola (sd), presented the meeting in agreement.
He told his Government that he was in contact with the government and that the Prime Minister of Juha Sipil (meaning) would call for a five-percent range of production options.
The President of the Akhavaan, Mr Fjäder (Kk), urged immediately to state that his agreement is ready.
The SAK's office did not begin to belong at all.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) is difficult to deal with when the allies ordered the country to stand on Friday afternoon.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's Labour Committee will meet on Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions to "open the labour market" .
In order to create a common representation of employers, the SAK should also adopt a five-percent production phase for the objective.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the government of Cyprus.
Mr Juka Ihanus, Head of Social Action of the STTK, has previously served as the Special Representative of the Central Prime Ministers, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinie.
In addition, it is natural to say that the ai government's participation has improved the whole time.
Whether to hurt or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean away from Finland's supporters, whose music was played by Akt's Marko Piraien (sd).
I feel like it's kind of a bit of a mess if it's already in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: More information about Lylyn's comments.
The Russians called Finland a bad father: "This can't be repeated"
The Russian Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki Etyj meeting.
In the opinion of the Russian Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Estonia than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun the hearing of the Etyin Parliamentary Assembly, in which Naryshkin gave wide comments on the Jewish meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian policies, such as Naryshkin, to be brought to the attention of the European Union's opposition to the meeting - a matter which the President was discussing to remind the rapporteurs.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the press office with Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the Naryshkin’s criticism was directed against the United States, where it had also been banned.
The Sanctions are political suicides from the EU, Naryshkin's newspaper.
The delegation of Mongolia of Russia came to the fore, so Naryshki continued to reside in Finland by body and by thanking Mongolia for the "extraordinary organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will work constructively and positively - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not have to be a barrier.
Naryshkin has met at Ulan Bator, the leader of the meeting, Ilkka Kanervan (kok), who has already discussed with the Russian media with the Russian delegation.
Closes the real playoff game: "The Earths in the Dark"
Matpara and Luke are going on Sundays, when they are both coming on the second day of departure.
Janne Lachti predicted that there would be no foreign land leaders in the House today.
The killer went to Kuopios last night to the 3-2-hour plan on KalPas.
The rise was a man, as the skipper group was at least two days away.
Well, I guess the number was even more molluscs.
The Romanian island of Tactical Blues, which began, was the rounds of the zero point, and the fatalities of 2-3 years.
The hard game, the worlds in the dark, if any play the same game as last year, Lukko attacker Janne Lahti predicted the settings on the follow-up pages.
The killer has been formed for the peaceful, pretty playoff-pressure.
The Tappara is named in the two preceding stages just below Luko's financial line.
In both cases, the solution is required by the seven solutions.
Last time, Luke took the cross to the castle in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three steps and ended.
There are no major changes in groups except for the number of groups.
Both of them were killed last night, and today they're gonna be dead.
At the battleground, Mika Noronen is making a place for Tom Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne is replacing Ryan Zapolski.
View: During the course of the course, you will be able to see a hard sample
President Doivola wrote a letter from the Prime Minister to the Rautakaloli, who was unable to continue, writing from Santtu Silvennoine Tampere.
It's classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone signed a Rocky photo where he himself showed his head.
The leader deliberately put the champions in the camps for Apollo Creed, the world's master of gravity.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he eventually lost his title training.
Three and a half years after Rocky's first daughter, Mika Doivola, wrote her hand-written Pori's unexplained motorcycle.
The name-and-favoured package has led to a surprise for all SM terminals in 2006.
The group was full of names such as Rocky, but weak attackers.
He was from the White Indians, Porin Mattia and Pele.
In the boxing games, players colored their heads red and broke their hips.
I hope it's blond.
The shop TV operator JP Jalo called the manufacturer Neamanni.
These guys took a win-win hope.
The hope was one of the saints.
The writer of the magazine, Mr Wivola, believes that the reform of this period is working the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of his own business has built an old house for bad boys.
Samir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been stuck in the distance like Rocky's sarcoids.
The causes of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Cuparsen are somewhere else than in the play.
The hope has been forgotten that Rocky VI is the head of Pekka Routakallio.
Karri Kiv has been described as Sean Connery.
The railway station in Toivola is one of the main players in Rocky's manual, as Connery had been in the beginning of 1976.
There's nothing else like Rocky's name in the railroad.
There is no connection between the play of the Red Cross and its triangular philosophy.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's different things to play harder than gambling.
The last time I saw Garret Stafford, Tapparan Jere Karjala's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the courts, but Routakallio put a man in the bathroom.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't approve of such games, and it doesn't belong to the short-distance game that came to Routakallio after the game to the Satakun Nation.
In this way, the team is well built.
It's June, veterans, police officers and constables.
There are no key players in the best game.
It's no surprise that the Chief of Staff has chosen an expert opinion.
How much have you been able to influence the players' contests, Pekka Routakaloli?
The recent developments have affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market has been slow, with a diplomatic response to the Red Sea.
I'm going to put a knife down.
In 1953, Rautakallio has obviously been interested in moving to Doivola's place as a sports event.
Men's contracts end in the morning.
There are a number of losses on the ground floor between 1 and 6.
The wish would not have been supported by continuing the manuscript.
Olga Temonen shows Sipe Santabuck's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband in Tuuka's teen years, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone is the first time in her husband's direction.
Yes, I'm going to introduce my husband to my mom.
Usually it feels crazy, like an actor and producer of Olga Temon's joke.
He has been married to the Apulan ex-bist and leader Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The Parisian society has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's leadership.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulan is in the beautiful picture of us is a drum of Sipe Santapukin's mother, Sirka.
Circa smacks and supports her son, even though this father, Risto (who presents Lorenz Backmann), is trying to be my voice.
The more I know about my real first visit to the Church, the easier it becomes to present the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuku that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the two of them were much closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've been texting.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different ages through their history.
Happily, the circus also understands that the drama is a drama and the truth may need to be colored.
Olga points out that Sirka was in Heinola almost the only one who sincerely believed that Apulanna would come from Finland's largest band.
At the age of 90, there were tears and real pain.
There was a little chance that someone was really successful, but Sirka had something intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot of about this youth before filming plans.
However, the history of the parents has been somewhat different.
So, if you're 15 years old, how many parents really know what you're talking about.
Olga reveals that his youth was completely different from the wicked traitor of Heinola, known as Tuuka.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had never had a movie with Tuuka to do anything.
He could've been very nice at the top.
According to Olga, for ten years she has worked so much with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been so cool.
Now the whole producer group goes to Heinola for months.
In fact, the elderly couple are going to spend time with their little children, often at home, because the interval is not too long.
We're calling the whole moon of the Spirit.
They've taken us really warmly against us, they've just asked us what to throw and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland as the most important exhibition feature
Timo Vuerensolan leader Iron Sky: The Coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
Pictures begin in October in Belgium.
Captain Timo Vorensola begins painting Iron Sky on October 2 in Belgium.
Iron Sky's scaffolding section, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will raise Finland's biggest example of all times to a budget of EUR 17 million.
Earlier the title of Finland’s most famous film had been at Jalmar Helander Big Gamel.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after the end of Iron Sky 2: as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola's director and Tero Kakoma's film production begins in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios rooms and lasts for eight weeks.
Commander Timo Vuorensola is leaving Belgium for the first week.
The budget is not afraid.
I've been in a very sick mood!
I'm so glad I've got a file on the manuscript, because I know exactly what the ceiling should be.
Everyone in the working group feels that they're going to do something unexpected.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although it's time hard, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to see that I'm going to show up to the general of this leff, he's telling the Nights.
The original film budget was estimated at 8-10 million, but the budget was also growing in the development of the manuscript.
It's a big budget, but it's a big store.
However, the film would be worth 100 million because each picture and performance is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's nothing to find.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a group-care campaign and a team workshop on Wednesday, which will pay 4-8 per cent a year.
The final height is determined by the demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay back.
The performance shows, among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Jewelry or coolie?
You're going back to places.
The trends in trends have recently been cleared by isolated logos.
Still another time, a well-designed dresser avoided clear and large logos such as Crocsey's consagna.
The mention of the Huppar or T-pad mark was seen as nothing more than a junta.
It's just time's changing.
Sports has come in the right form of a megathren, and also old, familiar sports car brands like Adidas and Nike have risen to the cooler subcarnation.
And as often as before, the limit of noise and trend is noticeable: if something is already a proper band, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a pattern in which the trends were surprised by the best possible weak basics of age than by a way of contrasting with the mass.
Now, instead of the hard core college, it is already covered by the cable-based networks that come in front of the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the better, the better.
In addition to the logos, such as the Adidas' famous bicycle networks, the team’s favorite games and the New York Yankees’ flagships have made their way back to the castle.
From the beginning of the falsifiers' trails, the Calvin Klein logos are now cool details.

I went through all the tanks.
And also in the next exhibition, I'm going to make it possible to go to all tanks and all the border crossings, you promised.
Diovo also complained about writing as a typical supplier.
One fool wrote and everyone else returned.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and ugly, but nothing like I've ever been in a tank has happened, he told Russia's luzhba novoste radio.
Zodov’s words support that no photograph of the accusation has been published, even though it took 50 000 people a few days.
From the incident of Zodov, the incident began at the beginning of the Bloknot.ru site, where Zodov was told about the shootings outside of the tank while he was trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he got out of the area.
Later, the Blocnot site would continue to publish a show where the organizers told their views about what happened.
Everyone's just used to getting soldiers to jump out of the truck quickly.
But the nationalist, Diodov, who led his father's creation, simply disappeared when he came out.
But he didn't even sit there for five hours, said the sample coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

Denmark Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against breaking too much
The IMF report published today in Finland follows closely the views of the Government and the Ministry of State of Finance.
The order was devoted to the structural reforms covered by Finland in order to address the economic problem.
According to the IMF, reducing overcrowding and wage-free days would support Finland's competitiveness.
Amendments should be made to the whole contractual system and to the safety of unemployment.
According to the Danish Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamä, the structural reforms are the same, but there are small differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of useful messages from the government’s action, but on the other hand, there is also a warning message about what should not be too difficult.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamek tells Talosannam.
Growth projects would also support the IMF's view to implement as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF predicted a 0.4% growth for Finland this year, which will increase first in the year to 0.9%.
Today, Denmark predicts that in its new relationship, growth will remain for zeros this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic than this year.
They may have had the latest findings.
This morning the Statistics Centre told the total production to be in the summer in small growth, Kuoppamäki is real.
The weak confidence of the industry or of the weakest measurements so said has been able to raise less attention.
However, the issue is only a small percentage of decimals.
Nintendo was named after the new leader of the death
In July, at the bottom of Satouru Iwata, who worked under Tatsumi Kimishima, began his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and had been recommended and charismatic growth in the field.
Iwata, for example, successfully responded to the Wii console's launch.
At 65 years of age, Kimishman's choice is not surprising.
He was one of the names that was identified as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's lead, an analysis of Ace Research to the Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see the removal of Nintendo by means of mobile games, but so that it does not feed the company on traditional pelicans.
Finland will be able to reach more and more substandard asylum seekers alone.
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing annually.
This has been reported, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants are lost annually.
The Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Finland will tell the Republic of Finland what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Do you have the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants lose "under" in the year?- In Finland a total of 156 applications for temporary asylum were made in 2013 alone.
You lost 9 of them.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them were lost.
The conclusion of the investigation may be that in dealing with the matter, the applicant is already registered in a country other than the Dublin Regulation and may have been found there in full time.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive than continuing to deal with the matter in Finland and returning to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014 the asylum seekers in Finland were all 3651, of whom 134 were granted an infringement decision because the applicant was likely to have changed from Finland, so the elderly asylum seekers lost 123 during the last year, he says.
Is there an increase in the number?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for temporary asylum alone.
The total number of missing minor asylum seekers this year is not yet available, but the number of minor applicants is then known and it has increased clearly, which is likely also affecting the number of missing persons, and it stresses.
How's the conversion decision going?
Are they also lost, for example, to the black labour market?
This is difficult to assess by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because the implementation of the conversion decisions is in the hands of the police, which stresses the cannelland.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (kk) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered attemptors in the country.
He's been running out of action.
Orpo, who was in the EU Deputy Ministerial Meeting on asylum issues, told on Monday about practical actions to manage the debt of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of devices
The sales of the missing media sector operator Timo T.A. to Mikkosen's TV and radio productions are now on sale.
Mikkos' side Nina Mikkonen sells Huuta.net devices that were currently the most advanced of professional instruments.
My first website was on the Internet.
Most of the equipment is now left on the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam diseases are no longer described.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested ones will be found.
Of course, equipment is no longer modern, but these are also needed for as long as there is a substance of an old generation that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there's a lot of fans - construction workers and their studios, Nina Mikkone's base for the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to change their current home in Myrskylän.
We can't take everything with us.
I've started an inventory and I've started to see where the goods are created.
I'm starting with this, Nina Mikkone says.
There's no use for TV or radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the survivors of brain cancer that a long time ago, a man has not returned to work.
Nina Mikkone notes that now we're only selling goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkos' immediate life was already archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives went to follow the film and other material from Myrskylä.
The risk of traffic being threatened is higher: Metro and trainers can stop as a whole family
The drivers of the Metro and Railways decide today whether they are expanding their activities by means of a series of opinions.
The original plan was to establish a time-limit for the establishment of the transport of metro and bicycles only on Fridays.
During the day you decide whether to stop your traffic all day.
The voter Pekka Hirvonen says the damage is great in the field.
Night and day cuts harm the drivers, so the government's plans to cut down the sheets raise the challenge.
Hervonen argues, however, that the establishment of transport throughout the day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and the railways are on their way home, the public transport is in practice almost completely stopped.
According to VR, johns do not travel by Friday between morning and evening.
They don't move around on Fridays, they don't move near or far away.
Before the morning, the young ones will be assigned to the deadlines.
According to the HSL data, most buses remain on the edge.
The members of the ACP shall be away from work on Friday morning at three o'clock in the afternoon.
Probably a small number of buses can be delayed, they will be sent to HSL’s rapporteur, Pirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL cannot say exactly what bus fares are going on Friday.
The employers' organizations will organise a large-scale conference at Helsinki Railways on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: The Hungarian police used gas to attack the refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees in front of the police.
The event took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, according to the news agency AP.

The Muslim boy was held in school in Texas - a teacher thought his own time was a bomb
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher had his own school bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to just present his e-mail address.
One of the teachers, however, had a time just like the bomb.
The police were invited to the scene, and eventually the situation ended when the boy was taken out of custody in the custody of the youth.
Mohamed has not been found at any stage, claiming otherwise than he had done in the past.
Nevertheless, it is still possible for the boy to be accused of making a lie.
According to Mohamed, the police had proved to be a "stupid bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of obviously border crossings and digital exhibitions between the leaders.
The killing took place in the last few days, and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days in prison.
His father is based on the case at his borders and the Islamic Council of the country is based on whether the case is yet another evidence of Islamophobia in the United States.
British Kohisee - Director of Labour refused to vote for the National Assembly
The song asks God to protect the royal throne, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The assessment of the right-of-the-law paper has also brought together the national rapporteurs of Corby's own lab.
This has created a nation, counting the lab representative Kate Green's general radio company in the BBC radio station.
Green thinks Corby's supposed to be joining the song.
In the evenings, British airplanes were honored to fight against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Working Party shall, in its official opinion, defend Corbynia and stress its respect for the possibility of participating in the flight.
We are all in great gratitude for the dignity of the royal air carriers.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully during the national elections, and the opinion was stressed.
Corby's election as vice president has divided the lab's lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will be held responsible for his radical views on the subject.
Corby's support is for the individual concentration, the cessation of savings and the growth of public expenditure.
The number of Corbyins is today the first time the vice-president's properties appear in Parliament at the Prime Minister's hour of question.
Corbyn has asked the general proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron's frame last week on Twitter, Corbyn will be elected Vice-President.
The working side threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, the Prime Minister has called for it.
I guess the reason for my family's death is still unclear... the father of the family was waiting for the sentence.
The South Lake Minnesota police have recently investigated the murder of a family member in Minnesota in Greenwood.
The family of five was found dead on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
When he first shot his wife and three of his children were killed by Brian Short in a car car.
I've been dead for days.
The family was found after the school was cared for for by the children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house to check it out and found a large house on the part of the Short family as a result of their death.
According to StarTribinen, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of businesses and successful businesses
South Lake Minnesota police officer Michael Sitar's case is still under way.
The motive for blood transfusions is still unclear.
Shooting Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014 in StarTribunen’s questionnaire Short reported four million different visitors on the site every week.
I've been given 50 purchases from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to make.
Kents sometimes sells a company, but not yet.
The event was seen, among other things, by the purchase of the Short family in 2011 from Greenwood to the house with two million dollars.
The building is famous for its construction site in Zillowi: there are only 12 rooms in the house, and there are also eight cars available.
Lawyers
According to StarTribun, however, the father was expected to be legal.
Achiev Test Prep, which offers various prep courses, had challenged him because of comments on the AllNurses.com page.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website did not remove misleading comments from prep courses and thus lost customers to competitors.
According to StarTribinen, however, it is very unclear whether the legal procedure would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered two coffees
In addition, the owner was rewarded at the event of the meal by the Finnish hypnotic horseman in the month of the month of Finland.
It's a great thing, Mr. Loir's comment is good for the kingdom.
The party, Fabrice Duo, won Derby on the first Saturday of September and deserved to win 100 000 euros.
The artist's legend, Loir, was still surprised at the success of Fabrice Duon in the big contest.
I still don't think it's happened.
The manufacturer of the memestyshevos Corpi, according to Loir, will get a full-time job with the horse in his work.
Pick up and decide which horse you're going to compete with.
And I like my turf, Lori's voice.

Canadian players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
Last year, the long-term captain Jean Beleveau collected millions of dollars for the same hospital, including the same hospital for children, and Saku Koivu collected the amount of money left for the other city's large office, where the hospital received a PET scanner needed for food research.

An agent in New York may ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris it is said that you're too weak.
Getting a job is a full-time risk game.

But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
I'll model you yesterday at the Tory Burch exhibition.

Psychology Advice: So tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to consider how to tell a child about the refugee situation in Europe.
Or will you ever say anything about it?
This does not need to be taken into account as a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff's advice.
Fewer children support protection, and for example, they don't see the news alone.
Little children can't always understand what they see, and it can stay around and worry, he says.
However, if a child has been exposed to television news videos or has heard about something else, it will encourage him to talk.
The discussion is good to take the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he is asking.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones whose parents think they're afraid of him.
The child doesn't have to be afraid of harm, even if he's worried and scared.
The younger the child closely follows his parents ’ conduct.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will also try to be safe.
Most children likely get involved in the discussion with refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to talk to them about the matter if they are thinking about the child.
The fact is, not everyone in the world is good.
Parents can discuss with their children how to deal with this in our family.
However, does the world think that the end is a safe or safe place?
Parents may also have different forms of growth - some may want to protect their children from the risk of depression.
On the other hand, if you are also discussing difficult issues in your family, your child will learn how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This could be good for him in the future.
Social Psychology Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
You're out of your power?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child.
Vermion-like Palosalam hard hills
Perttu North got lost at Apila Pallosalama in the middle of the middle of the winter.
It only cured the winners and doubles until the end of July at Tampere's border was hit by a storm.
Because of the origin of the product, the manufacturer doubted that something was wrong and tried to protect him from animal doctors for a time.
The explanation for the step-by-step would be significant.
The horse had a prison sentence.
The patient was not more comfortable to get through, but it took two medications.
Since Apila Palosalama had to be on a slow move, the North tells her that she has been very surprised about the last flight of the horse.
It was in Turkey in the preamble to the second SE and the second post-Tournut.
Apila Palosalama was very stressful when it had been normal for only a few weeks.
Since the things of little attention at the end of the day were understandable, the North says.
The manufacturer assumes that the good competition has made the gold.
The horse’s rage must have moved ahead, and hopefully it would have been restored.
This has been so said about the use of drugs.
When it's not interesting, it could've been thrown out without any disease.
On a good day, however, the origins of the wild beast have been shattered by such a list of enemies that they have been in human form.
During the march, the passengers will not pass to Palosalama, from which even the warm, warm beds will come out.
In the North, Vermosa's dream is to be buried.
However, there is a difference as to how it relates to Apilian Pallosalama.
It's a difficult time at the start, and even if a beautiful car is under the tree and it's like that.
Hopefully, the oil would have been more peaceful than it would have been at the start of the market.
Apilan Pallosulama is well able to come from the lake as well, and we will be able to enjoy the victory, the manufacturer's permission.
For this reason, you're not getting away from the remote iPhone program.
I'm the CEO of the app. Tim Cook.
At least I'm involved in the future programs with the Apple iPhone calls, but not all of them.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own programs from the iPhone, reports the company’s delivery director Tim Cook Buzzfeed’s questionnaire.
There are a number of programs that can be used relatively rarely, such as Facebook calls, Latvians, Health, Press, Podcasts and Vinkit.
The most recent addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an update to the iPhone calls, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart owners.
According to Cook, removing the App program is more complex than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they're removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook's gonna make Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention what the Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user get rid of them, you know, Cook.
According to Cook, Apple then investigates the matter, because the company does not want to cancel a reminder from users on the iPhone.
Euro area inflation decreased by 0.1% in August
In August, the euro area consumer prices rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent per annum, the EU Statistical Office of Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was below the drop in energy.
Eurostat checked for a return of 0.2 per cent in this couple of weeks, a little below.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
Thus, in August, the so-called primary inflation decreased by 0.9 per cent from July to July by 1.0 per cent.
Eurostat's baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
In the euro area last month, the energy was 7.2% worse than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In June, the increase was 0.1%.
Most of Europe's prices rose by 1.4% in Malta in August.
Cyproxic inflation was at a lower rate of 1.9%.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent of the minimum mark according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB predicts a average inflation rate of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
In the first year, growth rose by 1.1%, the Central Bank predicted its publication in new inflation services early in September.
In the United States, Fed is trying to break money policy.
In the United States, the next battle will begin at the latest less than a year, but probably within three years after the country's central bank Fed is moving back to its peaks for a long time.
And the financial markets will start to defend themselves before the next attack.
Fed has been ignoring its initial trends this week and the end of the year.
Thus, the next shift can be put at the top of the sex scene as quickly as possible and before the financial market collapse.
Or at least so if the world's largest economy and financial market operate as they have done, and if they react to the collapse of Fed's funds as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been adopted by the German Bank Deutsche Bank in London's market research strategies for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in the long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to international majors last week.
The research and reporting strategies do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start to climb its peaks or what is happening in the economy and in the market after that.
Instead, they present the facts and calculations of the various economic statistics, using the way the economy and the market have been used in the past and in the past during and after generations of Fed.
In addition to historical findings, they examine what the key economic and financial market changes are now at the same time or in a different model than in the course of the current trends and what might be followed.
Of course, both the economy and the financial market are now in a better position to sustain peaks than ever before in the 1950s.
I don't think it's gonna be a year.
The leaders of Fed's monetary policy and its all-in-Office are quite a long-term, starting with the time to be able to climb mountains.
The first seizure over nine years may already be experienced this week.
The matter shall be settled by Wednesday and Thursday at the time of the meeting of the Open Market Committee so stated by the board of the Fed.
The last time Fed did so said Fed Funds in June 2006.
This led to a two-year period of relatively regular but once again a series of 0.25 percent of corrosion units, which Fed increased from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market crisis began in 2007 in the United States of America on the most risk-weighted housing funding difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis was relapsed as a global day of judgment.
The great earthquake occurred in 2009.
In the last few years, severe opposition to the financial markets and the real economy has begun to worsen after more recent attacks by Fed.
Accordingly, the trials were more severe and worse than ever before in the 1930 ’ s.
Deutschen's strategies have led to the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950 and always since the early 1800s.
From the 1950 ’ s, they have been making clear the economic and financial implications of Fedin.
The beginning of the first cycle has taken the fastest time for less than a year, usually less than three and a half years and less than three and a half years.
The financial market rate has ended within two years from the start of the mergers of Fedin.
Fed has risen to the top and dropped to the top after the early 1950s, a unique cycle of thousands.
Each time it has been removed from some of the others, and reports are being examined relatively narrow, so on the basis of them, it is unlikely that any of the following trends will have any effect.
The strategies also remind us that many things are different this time.
And it's not just better.
Overcrowding too long
The root causes of the financial crisis have been found to be not necessarily to be found immediately even in research for decades.
But the three main causes of the crisis and its devastating causes are some undisputed discovery:
1) Fed, the ECB and other world's largest central banks were too late in the 2000s.
They were following a technical plan, and they also grew the following.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, the level of debt increased over and above the previous decade, with a higher impact on the monetary policy of the Central Bank.
The greatest debt in the economic history of the country was born.
3) In particular, as far as the financial sector was concerned, the gross debt-based financing provided by most of the financial market's share areas was the largest share of the economic history of the financial sector in which it was allocated to the buildings, debts and benefits.
Also, it is very difficult to argue that the financial market, which is still exposed to higher levels of debt, was at a low risk and uncertain level when Fed and the other central banks were finally able to rise above the peaks.
The financial structures entrusted to the debtor were not maintained until after the maturitys had begun and the cost of the debt treatment had been increased.
The risks were a financial crisis, and that led to a big confrontation.
Bigger cup and more debt
The Deutschen strategies do not consider what is going on, but give the theme of the wind by mentioning, for example, the following steps:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even easier than before the financial crisis.
If the peaks were too long before the crisis, they have now been even worse.
2) The debt has not been as bad as ten years ago, but now the debt is worse in writing than in air.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been eased but now the debt burden in different parts of the economy is much more heavy than before the financial crisis or at any time before it.
3) The liquidity resulting from the earlier and worse-off movements of central banks has remained largely on the financial market and has been lost to the most expensive securities and property types since then, or at any time, before or after the financial crisis.
They also note that not only do the strategies of the financial markets sound low, but also that even the US economy has not yet responded to the most serious financial crisis and for decades to the model it has taken.
The euro area economy must have taken action at all.
In other words, the real economy is inconsistencies in the ordinary but correspondingly the pressures and risks of the financial markets are much higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to distort its cash flow.
Perhaps the future picture of the French bank of the Society's General Strategy Albert Edwards' future is not as strange as it can immediately affect.
He has already prepared international investor customers in the bank for the following rules:
First, Fed climbs up hills, then the financial planes relax, and soon it's time for Fed to break down the financial space in even greater QEs.
The Hewlett-Packard (HP) that manufactures computers and results is intended to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are due to the business service of the HP, the company tells.
HP is distributed in November to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the consumer-oriented HP Inc Inc. company.
HP was the largest staff in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October the last year, the staff was suspended by 302000.
The company is writing on a regular cost of $2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25000-30000 employees.
The decreases in the consumer share will remain within 3300 years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60 per cent of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company will tell its balance sheet business so that none of its clients will respond more than ten per cent of its business results.
In the second year, its three major customers brought 65 percent of the business output.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after the iPhone Application update release
The new system of use can be requested by going to the Settings application, clicking "Open" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the date is ready, the phone will allow you to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation when the exhibition has been shown to fail with the "Software Update" announcement.
To this end, it is recommended that users either wait for the best windshield or try to update via the iTunes programme.
I called to teach the user at the end of the process.
This may include the removal of applications to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the total update and also facilitating processes in the new tool, which proposes removing applications and then re-install them in the preparation of the update.
Please make sure that the phone is loaded or in close proximity to the Latour during the update, that the clock does not end in the middle.
If the download level is too low, Apple does not give the update progress, because if the clock ends in the middle, it may lead to a deterioration of the update.

More: Minister Berner has acted as a tax agent in the government of the tax companies
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Central) has acted as a member of the company's tax administration.
According to the above, the company's activities relate to so-called tax planning.
This is from the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed a member of the government of Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still an official member of the government.
Berner himself says that he left a notice of separation in May this year.
I checked the matter, and it's enough that I've left a different report.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that registration tickets occur during the agreed period, Berner says in the Ylen questionnaire.
Membership after merger
The property of the Swedish Kährs is managed by the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a park promoter who founded the Finnish park promoter with Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner works in the Government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Government of Kärs and in the Luxembourgian company.
According to the above, Kährs' properties are going to Luxembourg through a multi-port property structure.
Berner tells Yle that he took up the request of the highest owner of Kährs in the Luxembourg government company.
This owner is Hartwell Capital.
I've been in the government of Karelia-Upoflor, the capital of Hartwell.
The company was asked for a partner who was found from Sweden.
This company is owned by the owner of the company which holds the company in Luxembourg.
I found that my job was to take care of the success of the Finnish family's capital.
It is important that we ensure that the production of the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the source is secure in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwell Capital's assets are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex property structure that could be taxed is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in the Triton was already a Luxembourg holding company for the property.
The ESPO’s Sustainable Reception Centre
In Espoo, Otania, the first maintenance centre of the company is open to adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred homes from tonight.
The number of seats can be increased within the week by at least 300 to 400 people.
The Agency for Migration shall be established at the premises of the reception centre of the former Rescue Centre.
The operation is maintained by Luona Oy, which is in particular the production of health and health services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agree together on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares a package of options for working life
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for government work coverage.
The company also hopes that other employers' organisations will be included.
According to President Antti Palola, there is now an opinion in the last half of the world.
The alternative means of reducing the price of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that after lunch, Palola took note of the organization’s management meeting with the suppliers.
Palola considered that the Central European Union (EC) is not prepared for the discussions instead.
The STTK economists have calculated that the company’s competitiveness package contains a variable security of EUR 30 million for the employer when the other side of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party has the great intention of having a discussion if the party has one hundred relations.
Palola: The negotiating connection has been to be built
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (meaning) has hoped that the alternative proposals will be made by Wednesday, since then the government will have to give its own package of information to the public and start preparing the reforms.
I don't know if the schedule is realistic.
The discussion with the government is based on Palola's existence, and it has been for her to be built all the time.
According to Palola, the area of the STTK's solar system is the main area of the solar system.
The order requires that the government withdraws from the proposed legislation which would have been implementing some of the infringements.
According to the STTK, Palola does not welcome the preparation of an alternative package with a pending SDP.
The employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to protest against the government's offer of a working life-saving package last week.
Part of the package, i.e. the first sick days' wages are paid, overloads are broken, sunglasses are reduced to 75% and the ceiling is reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have called employers into the opinion country and that the purpose of the scheme has not been legal.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
The President of the Board, Mr Fjäder, welcomes the announcement made by the STTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fäder, the STTK will now come to the same line with Akava, as Akava has more than a long-standing alternative model for government presentations.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also be provided with an alternative package, since without SAK, the package will not be sufficient.
The President of the Akhavas, Mr Fjäder, hoped that, according to the future of the SAK, Lauri Lylyn, he would prepare the presentation as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK told me last Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has already prepared its own presentation, which is ready to negotiate on the goal of the government of the country as a five-percent competitive option for cuts.
Akava has been ready for consultation all the time, and we have already written a long list of options for government presentations.
We are ready to consider the terms of service as part of the contract.
On the contrary, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's lines, as STTK has done last Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We're now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employees of the country, Fäder says.
The Committee of the Regions shall meet on Thursday 15 a.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the Agreement.
"The same wine, the common oil, the tent" - play bingo in Sipil's speech at night
Green Left of Tampere University
The last night of Viva's Bingocupank, the Green Left of Tampere University.
The prime ministers have previously held separate talks during the Cape of Mentsla and the war.
Prime Minister Ruha Sipilä speaks very differently to the people of Finland about the state of Finland's economy at the Ylen Canal on Wednesday, 21.05 p.m.
When asked by the Prime Minister to speak in 1932, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in holding the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mantsää's Capina.
After that, the president and the ministers held several radio talks during the winter and the follow-up.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho took President Mauno Koiviston instead of the new year's speech, but it was more ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended up on television with the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of freedom of movement.
A single call from a monarchist.
The Spanish speech has raised criticisms and criticisms throughout the day about what I should be doing.
The President of the left-wing party, Mr Arrhimäki, stated on Twitter that "Sipila could keep her speech on the nation's status in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister in which the speech would also be held to be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinstunt, "a single call has already been seen.
The leadership is part of a dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Court of Justice ruled on Facebook that "Monarchist: Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
SDP president Antti Rinne called on Sipil's dialogue: "I'm half a year from election.
Not only did the Prime Minister appear on the media with opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Council, the Sipilian speech has been pre-eminent and will last for about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented in a direct letter by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC delivery director Jyri Häkämies.
The majority have been assessed for presenting the Sipil speech.
We considered the matter and agreed that it is part of the public service task to promote the wide audience throughout Finland, on the line of the Head of Public Publications, Ismo Silvo Ylen in the news.
As in the Time of the End
The speech has also raised controversy.
In the evening, you will enjoy the evenings with a good time, your children will be bored and you will be the best.
Mother put on a fine shirt and the father adjusts his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we are late on television than before we remember,” writes a blogger, Saku Timonen.
"When Prime Minister Sipila also spoke about why the Finnish government is sitting in a tax-arranged capital with millions of money hidden from other tax-trafficking companies, and at the same time say to the people that it is necessary to cut money when the government is done?" asked Pia Lohikoski.
As far as Sipil is concerned, one opinion is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by an early band.
Do we hear of the same Russian, the common cold, the wildness of life and the team life?
Coupons and chains ready, at 21.05 a.m. it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
At Ahtisaari Guardian: The Westerners opposed Russia's proposal on the elimination of al-Assad
Last year, President Bashar al-Assad told President Mattti Ahtisaari Guardian of the offer of Russia.
According to Ahtisa, Russia's UN website proposed a plan to which al-Assad would have been able to speak out in a pleasant manner after some time.
However, the latter did not object to the proposal because they believed that al-Assad was missing within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaer, Vetali Tshurki, a Russian envoy, listed in the two main discussion three points: the opposition did not receive weapons, opposition and al-Assad had to be contacted immediately, and the promise against al-Assad had to be fulfilled gradually.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not have to agree on all the same things, but we can openly discuss them.
I told him what I did there, and he said that sit down with Alas, Martti, so I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari reminds you of Guardian's challenge.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaar tells his message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurki did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but Ahtisaera said that there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaera's claim, but said that al-Assad's troops had already committed numerous mob attacks and the main opposition groups had refused all the contracts he had left behind.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Foreign Ministry's Middle East Party, is in a position to address the issues raised by Ahtisara, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the case of al-Assad at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assadia throughout the war.
On the weakest point in Ahtisaera's claim is that Tshurki spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about Tshurkin, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have doubted whether Putin's debt would have been maintained by some al-Assad's support.
Our own actions are a warning to us
During the negotiations on the Ahtisa, the Syrian crisis killed about 7,500 people.
According to the UN estimates, the death tolls exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have had to leave their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
Turning refugees into Europe is our own business.
I don't see any other options like taking good care of these ugly people.
Now we're paying the bill that we made ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the press.
Location of asylum seekers in Turkish Tornion
The plan of the Government to plan for the North Finland for asylum seekers is likely to be based on Tornion.
The centre would be based at the centre of the city on the construction of the nearby Tower Community.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a place where it is necessary to improve the management of refugees from the Soviet Union.
Helsingin Sanomat, of course, stated that the Authority would have decided to present a report on the school building to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hyeppisen, the vice president of the city administration of Turin, it does not take his place.
When the whole authority was not in school and part of the message wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the first country to decide on the matter, he referred to the STT.
On the ground during the debate, 36 were authorized from 43.
In response to 13 orders from the Consequences Centre.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision would be a positive, beautiful statement.
According to Mayor Timo Nouise, the city received no contact on the subject on Monday, and the matter was responded rapidly.
It would be possible to assess 500 asylum seekers on a number of occasions.
The applicant has examined that it could apply to such use.
Sitting is a pairing of meters on the wall, so it would also be in the mind of the young man.
Sipi still hopes for a job market option for coverts
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) in the public, the allocation of pensions would only cover part of the government's goal of calculating the cost of work.
However, the Government considers it to be against the alternative package if labour market organisations succeed in making such a deal.
Sipile told the rapporteurs in his delegation that he had not been in contact with the labour market organizations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternative means of informing the government of the darkness of working life.
If such an agreement arises, we will take it without any pleasure against it as part of the complete package.
The sharing of loans would be effective, as it would be appropriate for nearly all employers, for example, to plan for a government's solar eclipse.
The labour market organisations could agree on the cut-off of wages because they have been registered instead of the labour market agreements.
The Government shall report these findings to the public on the first Wednesday of the week of the year on the hidden life of the working community as a matter of state-of-the-art communication.
According to the Spanish authorities, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
There's no final counter at all.
The legislative process will then begin to move, that is, the lion is moving, and it will become more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
I won't go long in such things if you want to.
The last week of publication of the management list includes, inter alia, the amendment of the deadline and the deadlines for the free-of-occupancy period.
In addition, wages for the first days of illness will be paid, overcrowds will be broken, sundial rates will be reduced to 75% and the rent will be reduced.
The amendments will be carried out as a compulsory legislative end for professional associations, which has raised a strong appreciation.
In addition, through the action of the Employment and Economic Development Organizations, a large majority of professional organisations have announced political bills on Friday.
The Customs Authority approved an extension of the property of the country
The authorities of the Dominican Republic unanimously accepted the extension of the property of a small minority of Nordic Koivu Oy's government.
The assessment led to the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the original one had been mentioned.
The fast schedule is also very close.
It was little wonder, however, that there was no need for statistics the year that the previous enlargement was completed.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400 to 450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the funds were decided to increase in the contribution report.
The presentation also discussed the investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Iconen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and taxes to the local community.
There is no risk, as the company pays the investment rent, the Water Pollution (p.) basis.
Instead of the language of Karjalan in Joensus
The city administration was pleased to move its position to the centre of Joensuu in order to bring Roman Catholic Catholics to the center of the city.
The new decision is important and right to think about the choice of military tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu will not be published as the capital of the karja language, because it has no historical basis and the language of the karja is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken at the end of this century has become more and more common in the former Soviet Union.
After the new decision, the city centre will not become a caralytic cataclysm.
However, the town of Joensuu is, in a case-by-case manner, also prepared for the introduction of the language of karate, for example in the infotaulu and on the travel market.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single country, he also supports the use of the language of the karaoke now that diversity lives and changes powerfully in the North Caribbean.
The Karjala language is still unique in the country, as is the ideal Yoenusta as a forest town throughout Finland.
Both can be used well in a wide variety of markets in the country.
Derogations of association reduce the animal health of the country
The cuts in the relationship will allow the country to live with a strong hand.
Business relations directly affect the country's business life and competitiveness.
And it's going to affect whether we can stay here and do things, and President Kari Karjalane is surprised.
He also highlights the transport that has been carried on several times in the report.
It is important for the whole country not to be able to reduce our opportunities by State measures, as it is now in place.
The effects of these traffic connections should be considered, for example, on employment, by emphasising Karjalinen.
The deterioration of relations will lead to increased attractiveness to the University of East Finland.
Of course, the best services here, such as traffic connections and your apartment, is easier to get students and workers, director of the University of East Finland Jukka Mönkönönönen.
He notes that bad travel connections also affect the research community, which is very moving and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment officer Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult at present to market the university in West Finland because travel connections are lacking in childhood.
About half of the students from the University of East Finland will now come from outside East Finland.
Again, about 10-20 percent of them are re-examined, which is explained in part by direct contact.

The vision of the city management of Joensuu is apparently unique, but there is one group of sorajas.
At the monthly meeting of the Government, Mr Pentti Kessikalo, a member of the City Management Board, presented a full commitment to the entire project, but his presentation was undeserved.
The Authority adopted the Kari Karjala Decision, which was revised in early October before the City Authority meeting, which provides a final opinion at the same time with all other citizens.
One anniversary of Kotkasa Kouvola will end in the first year
Your personal transfer from Kotka Kouvola to the future remains, even though it is more rare for the European Union.
Changes to personal transport between Kotka and Kouvola will take place in March first.
One of the Europeans will be gone, but on Friday, he will come from Kotka to Kouvolo and on the contrary.
The mergers are the result of State rescue operations.
For the next four years, the transport costs of the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest tracks are to be stopped completely.
VR developed new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys jumped into the hole, one didn't get down, the guys moved out.
The rescue plant delivered a stone to a cave by the age of 12, which was not able to escape from the castle itself.
The situation was born in the Tower of Turin in Ketotia in six o'clock in the morning.
There's an old two-pound tree that doesn't have any stars for the cat.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to rock the room to the roof of the next room.
Some of the boys went down the same road, but none of them.
As a result, the other survivors and the survivors warned the rescue facility instead of helping the final cat to safely return to the earth.
FedEx's business policy is double, tax year 2016
FedEx reported the massive results of its last quarter, and the supply deficit declined throughout the year due to the decline in demand for railway services and the higher costs of its services.
The company also said it was going to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for a period of time.
Last year, FedEx announced that it is paying 50,000 seasonal workers for hours.
Its share dropped by about 2.5 per cent in the open-air market 45 minutes before the opening of the middle week.
FedEx Corp. says it is expected first in May as a result of the final tax year, $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the final forecast.
The analysts expected $10.84 to be told about FactSet.
In spite of the average price increases of 4.9 per cent coming into force on 4 January and despite the higher charges that started in November in the transport of heavy or large packages.
The company said it would expect a growing business target over the previous year because they have reduced costs, the trade change has increased, and the network trade is growing.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "will continue to take into account the expected weak economic conditions of production and world-wide trade in particular."
The plans for remuneration were published for the rest of the period following the day after the competitors told the UPS that they were going to pay 90-95,000 extra workers, the same amount as it was paid last year.
By the end of 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share amounted to $2,42, which will remain at $2,44 on average. A 12-analytical question was made by Zacks Investment Research.
Business exchanges rise by 5 per cent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Zacks' six analysts expected $112.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a reduction in international priority transport in recent years, which has stopped the development of the Exchange of Trade in Express Unit.
However, the increase in network trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the unit increased by 29 per cent, but in principle the results of the activities were the same as the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was higher due to higher basic payments, while the higher labour costs were higher in the railway operation.
In the opening shop about an hour before the opening ceremony, FedEx shares amounted to $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $15.15.
FedEx was closed by 11% this year and 17% below the forecast of 11 June.
In the United States, the Central Bank's decision-makers will be sitting this week for two days at the conclusion of a meeting of the Great Lakes Council for a long period of time, whether it has been time to raise the threshold for the first time for almost ten years.
In the second access to the Central Bank's correlated, two-fold meeting rooms are the property of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, must put the economic benefits of the nation at the top of the list.
The Congress has assumed the double responsibility of the Central Bank for cards: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep the prices stable.
However, after the great famine, the central bank’s leaders have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
That is why this third requirement can be a decisive factor in a decision to publish as a toast, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision is whether the US economy is ready to be approached with a preliminary incentive which has been almost permanent since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the information shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent half of the world's financial markets may have already been made more stable by the central bank's officials than ever before in order to increase uncertainty.
"The labour market and inflation are clearly the first and most important things to follow," says Lindsey M. Piegza, editor-in-chief of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they seek a right to a higher level of promotion, increased uncertainty on the world market is necessary to wait for a sound basis," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached with a common understanding, which has already led to a ermosity of the economy.
According to a recent study in Bloomberg, about half of the economic experts predict that the level of pride will rise this week.
The financial market also expects the central bank to slow down because, according to the central indicator, there is only 30% chance of growth.
This refers to the calculation of the securities market, if the central bank is to rise to a level, otherwise the decision-makers would then succeed in making a firm promise that the next rise would not occur in the near future.
As the Dow Jones industrial average index rose from 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 percent, with a new peak of 16,599.85.
According to the withdrawal, the Central Bank was expected to maintain the level in advance this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's lead economic experts.
"I'm surprised, if the central bank's picking up the tops right now," he says.
If the decision-makers are proud, "they have to see a lot of trouble in their line to support financial markets so that they don't get into trouble."
Other experts argue that the level has fallen to the level of peace in the financial markets, as it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank is operating.
Only a month later, it became apparent that the Central Bank would have a high level of four percent this month, thus taking the first small step towards slowing down the financial situation, which would ensure the stability of recovery in the United States.
Yellen has proved early in the morning and early in the morning that he expects to rise this year despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in his complaint.
Although the creation of new jobs declined in August, the growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate last month decreased by 5.1 per cent, which is the figure of seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank holds as the limit of full employment.
The growth of the palms has shown signs of shrinking.
Although inflation is still below 2 per cent of the central bank's annual objective, the central bank's decision-makers say that this has a significant temporary impact on the price of oil dropped.
The report "several of the highest levels and also needs to be taken into account in the strict situation of the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, manager of the company Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world declined in the last week when China took control of its currency.
The Dow Jones industry averaged up to 16% of its strong forecast when investors were afraid that the slow economy in China would also slow down global growth.
Markets have reached some level this month, and the Dow Index is now nearly 10% below the weighted threshold.
For the decision-makers of the Central Bank, the market mellerry is an additional factor in a complex combination, which tells us why the level of pride has to rise.
"I look forward to these events of the financial markets and the recent reforms of the economy in China over the past few weeks, the decision-makers would hide the level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and the former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers will wait at least a month for better treatment.
"The possible effects on the United States economy are still very uncertain, and they do not have any information on the use of what will happen as a result of China's events," Oliner says.
The improvement of the international economy is not a key concern of the Central Bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making process.
In practice, however, the Central Bank of the United States has become the world’s financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been unplanned in recent years.
In 2013, then President Ben S. Bernanke, the contention that the Central Bank could "spend" on the increase in the amount of money, led to distortions in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies continue to prosper, the central bank officials are expected not only to pursue the following development, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to better address the global economy.
The Central Bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the Investnet Inc global strategy.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Bank) in the state of Virginia noted in this month that "the Central Bank has previously over-resisted its financial markets, which have been affected by the different economic frameworks."
The Federal Open Market Committee on Decisions has called for a rise in competition, and Lacker, a member of the Committee who is voting, is invited, for example, to the 1998-99 decisions.
The economic crisis caused the Central Bank to break down its reference value by 0.75 per cent during the three-year meeting "without prejudice to its limited, recognisable effects on economic growth in the United States," Lacker says.
A year later, the Central Bank took all these cuts.
The Central Bank should maintain economic stability only during a major crisis, as was the collapse of the market in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Central Bank of England.
Finally, mylerry won't get close to that level, Posen's real.
"No one wants to be in such a situation that the high level of growth is threatened because the market is deteriorating," said President Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act (Federal Act) of the Federal Republic of Germany still contains a double requirement and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, it should not be expected of them.

Brazilian Children's Association in Rio Grande announces a healthy diet for farmers
The Brazilian Children's Association SPRS has found a shocking way to try to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition as a mother-to-child by publishing pictures of baby babies in strange breasts where illustrations of unhealthful food have been painted.
Rintamate consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
In pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie to about 500 calories.
However, a new study shows that increasing the calorie level is not the only choice for mothers to make.
A recent study conducted by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genetic expression and protects their babies from developing plants.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven-kanavan Sunrise program is popular in the viewer but despite Nine-kanavan companies to update the director's presentation in Today Show program
Karl Stefanovicin and Lisa Wilkinson's tour of Canberraa to renew the post-authorisation of the Liberal Party failed to increase the visibility of Today.
The Nine-Canaan morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull said he was going to beat Tony Abbott.
The competitive Sunrise program, called David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of the week's ongoing series of international communications, including Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancun.
The minimum burden was not to be felt by Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise’s peak was 397 000 in the five state capital city, when Toda’s number was 339 000.
The mean value rose slightly compared to the country (317 000) and last to the number (283 000), but it was still lower than the last tortoise (343 000).
Today's been arrested for the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
On the other hand, during September, the average Sunrise is 349 000 viewers when Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of all.
The changes in the winds speak this morning as well as in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa can do it. Thank you for asking.

Seven-kanavan's great news was a 800-word series, where the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson was an amazing priority.
A new drama series, which drew up an average of 1,219 million viewers, recently tells of a single father who decides to change the New Zealand border with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson's recommended strength is alone without Rafters from Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven-kanavan The X Factor program was strong in its view of 1,136 million, making it easy to win The Block series (838 000) and TBL Families series (726,000).
The Seven Canal was a double trial on the second night of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O'Keefen, the first half-year-old in a new summer programme (17-17.30) gathered 446,000 spectators on Wednesday.
Another semi-sound (17.30-18) hit 623 000 viewers - which was enough to win a small victory from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday morning, The Chase Australia's first half-hour watch average was 520,000 viewers, and on the second half-hour, the maximum was 720,000.
Hot Seat's average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night review of the survey led to the confidence of the Nine Canal that Hot Seat will finally come to the recommended program at 17.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program that failed to reduce McGuire's viewers.

Is there any way you think Sam Wood is a perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski could be in danger of discovering who wins The Bachelor's line.
The woman's personality has been held in the most extraordinary secret with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are not really a lipstick who got the last breath.
However, during our discussions with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three came, they could hardly give up on the personality of the winner.
Sam Wood's voices have been signed before the storm's final.
All three women disappeared in a romantic way when they told how Wood is a perfect man who mentioned his humor, honor, family dignity and positiveness as a reason why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Woody's last meal is not for you, who should go for it?", they could offer a revelation of who won the boy's heart.
Both Yeavons-Fellows and Marcoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after their own.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been busy since the first day.
"From the moment I went into the room, (Sarah) the energy and the energy of Sam felt almost in common, and that thought was in my mind all the time," Yeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah's really close to the country, she's happy to be here," Markowski added.
I've seen them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel nice and happy together.
Sarah Mackay believes that he and Sam Wood agreed well.
Mackay said that last week's homework got him to realize that Wood could be "it's true."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this would not be just a game - I am now with my whole heart here," he said.
When asking who Wood was supposed to choose if he didn't, Mackay was valuable.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the rest of the girls, so it's a level between Snezan and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 19.30 a.m. Ten Canal.
I'm going to publish it called "Sarah's best option for Sam Wood?"
Jarryd Hayn has many options to start his NFL
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his change in the United States, and many other groups have asked him about him after his opening day.
Hayne, however, chose the group of San Francisco 49ers and producer Jim Tomsula, and this made a wise decision.
Some manufacturers would have left the Hainen option for the final time after this translation of the Australian rugbyli was thrown into the ball on the first flight to the team, winning Minnesota as a winner from 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayen to return the next flight and took her to the racetrack after Reggie Bush hit.
The real nature of Tomsula was also seen in the bedroom after the game.
Instead of envying his new arrivals in front of the other group, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in the post-mortem press.
49er's Specialist Cam Inman reported that Haynea would also encourage the coordinator of the Special Teams Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the missing ball and to worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane that Minnesota Vikings hit on the first flight
This wasn't really the beginning of Hayne and her Australian fans were hoping for a man's NFL-debyty.
It was seen on a crazy road in the countryside after a fall, and later she told the Australian radio station Hamish & Andy 2DayFM by saying 104.1 that she would not have been able to imagine the worst start of the NFL.
"It was just one of these cases now, just to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her gambling in 2007 to her Origin Debytyt, when she went to Queensland in her own territory.
Still, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne took her passport to the Instagram style in a photo release with fans in front of the Australian flag.

4 died under police attack against prospectors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old son, died in southern Nepal from the police raids on a group of violence, which indicated that the country was thinking of a new constitution proposal, the government told it on Wednesday.
It happened on Tuesday morning in Rupande, about 175 miles west of Katmandu's capital.
Colonel Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that there had been more than 1,000 conspirators gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used gas and then shot the air before protecting them.
Twenty police officers and five civilian suspects, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why the species known to be killed, but used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The report was last week's ongoing violent attacks on the various parts of the southern part of Nepal, where members of the Madhes ethnic group said that the new provinces established under the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in eastern Nepal when the Tharus Group requires its own state.
After 10 August, at least 40 people died in violent concentration camps, 11 of whom had been police officers.
On that occasion, four main parties signed a contract that was awarded to the provinces - this is a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been central administration for centuries.
The new Constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process since the fall of April when the earth’s destruction killed thousands of people.
This week, legislators have voted in favour of the draft Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Constitution will be adopted until Sundays.

Google starts a donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) would publish a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees in Europe to escape from war and from poor countries.
Google had a unique personal perspective on its blogs of the award campaign.
Instead of making the announcement, the manager, in his personal experience, wrote to Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who had been packing with his family from Kabul for seven years.
"We are listening to a number of dark johns and bus stops, as well as hunger, hunger, thirst and darkness," he wrote.
I was happy.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The grants will receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations Repatriated.
Google said that it corresponds in the same amount to each worldwide donation made on google.com/refugeelief page up to $5.5 million, so that the total goal is $11 million.
In Europe, the worst refugee crisis is then the second world war, and the main reason is that the Syrian internal war has lasted for four years, which has taken more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many have also left the war on Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dilution can help mildly transportable diabetics
According to the new study, the benefit of type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly passing diabetics live longer than they are treated in other ways than in surgery.
"The acquisition of mortality data will last for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a radiological expert who wrote a new study on JAMA Surgery's journal.
Several methods are used for reducing the amount of oxygen in the diluent.
They reduce hunger and limit food poisoning.
Over the years, barriers have been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have had cancer and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. weight ratio, is considered normal when between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it reveals that someone is overweight, and if the person is more than 30, he is considered to be a trafficker.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new research, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare the two types of bariary cuts, the closure of the bone marrow and the reduction of the bone marrow, to the medical treatments of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly mobile.
The study showed that the average number of persons affected by BMI decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained at the same time as those treated by other means than surgery.
36% of patients treated with diabetes have improved overall and 28% have been partially.
As a result of comparison, only 1 percent of diabetes in the drug-treated group was improved and approximately 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL collector "were generally taken in the best distribution group", the writers noted.
Researchers also followed the levels of blood haemoglobin A1c that reflect blood sugar levels over a long period of time.
Haemoglobin A1c should be maintained by less than 7%, written by researchers.
Following administration, the haemoglobin level A1c decreased by approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable by about 8%.
This improved "glycemic control", described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, told Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of cuts.
In the fifth year when compared to the small drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in the drop in weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the increase in the weight index (7.4 and 5.1), the decrease in haemoglobin levels of A1c (3.1% and 2.1%), and the most likely to achieve a complete diabetes resuscitation (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoinex Blackstone says that although the study does not appear to be viable or delayed after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to a longer life with more people.
According to a Swedish study, 29 percent of traffic accidents in traffic accidents were more likely to die within 15 years of being compared to a group that had experienced more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not appear to improve the survival of patients with diabetes, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging to people with BMI below 35 who are interested in treatment.
"The results are crucial just because they show that the reduction is safe for a lower weight index group", and that it does not involve risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take very seriously at the stage of BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has made these genetic changes that are constantly preparing his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to undo the situation.
"All can't come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees in addition to the real solution to the current refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the homes of refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis in the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford.
Dalai Lama said that, in the present situation, the needs of all humanity should be put on hold to individual nations or even countries.
He also stressed that while the response of the Western European countries to refugee crises must be surprising, it is also insufficient.
"Not all can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama has been more active in the crisis in Germany and Italy, he stressed that there is only an interim solution.
"I am surprised to see a number of thousands of refugees, but there is a need to consider long-term solutions: how these Muslims can bring true peace and real development, almost through education.
The first thing is how we can reduce killing in their land.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
On the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused border events.
"After 9/11, I presented in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the number of children’s handicrafts has increased to fourfold.
In the case of children under 12 years of age after 2010, almost 400 per cent of the United States has reported a strong rise in the reduction of alcohol-related substances in children under the age of 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopezi, the adverse events reported to the mercy centres in the case of desinfictions in children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are interested in these products more often and unfortunately, yes, a certain percentage of them is due to update policy," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children are eating disinfectants for a purpose, while others want to influence their friends or respond to a challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos where teen-agers drink disinfectants to get a bad growth rate.
According to the reports, the products have combined the disinfectant into an alcoholic juice to make a stronger drink.
The effects of pleasing disinfectants may affect younger children.
"Children don't think this is bad for him," said Lopez.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are those whose income has been added to them.
There are manicures, grapefruits and oranges that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain alcohol between 45 and 95 %.
In particular, young children need only a few injections for alcohol business.
"It's a really refined alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4: in Kansas City.
So this would not leave whiskey to the bed, but the handicraft is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it is a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who, some time ago, had only four cancers of manicures in the school, and was taken to be treated as an anesthesiologist.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of the age limit of driving, told Essenpolylin doctor Chris Ritchey, who took care of the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When she spoke, she could not walk when she reached the steppe.
Doctors followed him over the night in a different hospital for possible brain tumors, as alcohol got the girl to lose and cut her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," his mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been a killer for my child.
Finally, it is recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and transfer their disinfectants out of children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol business, some disinfectants have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two thorial women died of hand - drawn disinfection, which contained toxic, unreported substances.
Health authorities claim that the product contains methyl, a deadly substance and not ethyl alcohol, which has been reported as an active substance.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three of the four categories were planning to impress their "high" teacher by disseminating the bacterial plant into the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant and refused to classify it.
The police must prevent the plan from being "sustained" and leave some side effects on the school borders.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no disputes
Griffiths tend to talk less about Celtic contradictions, and Deila admits that Hopes is in a tight position, but she'll get it turned into something.
Hearts fight Scotland's football league against Neilson's crimes, and Warburton is equipped with color races that can disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons grew up leading to Celtici's reference point
Adam Rooney's first half-year sentence took Aberdeen's head to win from Hamilton at the Pittodrien Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to make a difference to Celtici's reference point.
Griffiths reduces disputes
Celtic's internal conflicts have resulted in riots, but Griffiths has stopped them immediately. He claims that he and his team members have no sense of working more closely under the supervision of the group when they are preparing to meet the Head of the Netherlands.
I think we're not under stress, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scotian masterhouse to satisfy Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers central player and former Dutch football player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch footballers have lost their interest in Celtici because there is no competition with Rangers.
Ajaxin's current envoy de Boer said, "The Dutch don't show the places of Celtic games anymore, and why?"
Because Rangers aren't involved.
People here don't just talk about Rangers' request.
They're talking about old firm groups.
They're talking about both groups together, and they're interested in it.
There are a lot of enthusiasm in these groups, as well as other Scots who want to follow them.
Deila swears she's turning around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in difficulty, but the Norwegian bomb is about to turn around.
The destruction of Malmöl and the result of the overcrowding of the Masters quickly resulted in the destruction of a ten-year-old man named Aberdeen, who is now at the edge of the line at five points away from the next.
But Deila said, "Celtics have had bad sections before, and we're gonna get up again."
Now we just want to get rid of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is disgusting and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what's going on.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is equipped with game events in January
Although Mark Warburton made a few weeks ago a comment on possible January players' movements, he is careful to ensure that he does not want to mix the team's unity.
Previously on Brentford, he said: "The January transition window is very different from the one in the middle window."
In the case of the players in the Middle East, there is a time to adapt to the current situation, which appears to be in our team this far.
The group's really good.
At times, increasing the number of unwanted players can make it more difficult.
Celtic’s interest in MIchu’s recovery
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name has been attached to the transfer window in Celtici, has been disappointed that he can remain married after the end of his contract with Swans.
A 29-year-old player has had a two-year-old skirmish, and he has not been able to find a new track outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight Scotland's football league because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1, when Patterson was removed from the field, and the team was subsequently destroyed by the defendant's red card later, and this was already the third Collum's court red card that was stolen during the last eight months.
Nelson keeps saying, "I did not question the truth, I did not comment on what happened."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
A faithful Hiberian player had to be encouraged to sing a song of the former Hearts player Rudi Skace.
The event took place in the pub in Edinburgh Roseburn, before Edinburgh Derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"There was a Derby and it was a moment of opinion," the attacker added, "I need to say, "I don't go back to Tynecastle, but then move to play Celtici."
Tannadic government believes Dundee United Leader - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United government still has the ability to turn its situation around, but admits that the decline of players must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes happy "winning" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was reluctantly involved in playing against Hamilton Aces, but he succeeded in reaching his seven-year-old successor, who gave them five points over Celticia.
McInnes says, "There's no group that's won anything, then it was a poker or too much that wouldn't have won games in this way."
Scottish unemployment continues to grow in the same way as the whole of Britain
IN Scotland, 164,000 persons remained between May and July, while unemployment in all Iso-British countries increased by 10 000 in total to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in Britain than 5.5 per cent, the figures of the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people over a period of three months, and the number of employees is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland was 74 per cent higher than the average in Britain than 73.5 per cent during the annual census.
The Scottish Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on these last readings: "The Government's long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the British Isoa.
During these 12 months, Scotland's labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has decreased.
Why I Witnessed in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I'll see today when a man is arrested.
If so, and I hope not, I'm sitting in the audience paper at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison when Richard Glossip is executed in a death sentence.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses who died.
I answered my request in January through his best friend, and even though I was upset, I agreed.
I'm starting to lose this day near it.
So why did I agree?
I was surprised because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique view.
It is also possible for operators to monitor operations in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected by default.
Oklahoma has reduced the storage space for the media from two years to five.
Whoever's ever called out then, look at what's going on.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also created my own contact with him for months and a two- and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often while we're talking.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a supplier, so I can't have a memoranda and a knife to record.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, one of the Czech suppliers accused me of being committed to my stand-alone.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner the story by the way he wants you to get involved.
I chose the supplier.
He admitted that "it would have been better to say what he said", but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been different from some of my relatives and writing things.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that if he said.
I've told him that he can 'cause he can take me away from the witness.
But he wants us to have an international supplier who's writing about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my series of podcasts.
I'm not gonna go through all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is guilty.
After Barry Van Treesen's murder, his actions would in any case involve the help of the criminal.
But I think there's a very strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong for him to do that.
And then this is the look I'm looking at her dying.
I can't claim to be completely independent.
There must be other suppliers who care about it.
You can tell me how you feel when the man I love is dying unnecessaryly.
A man was kidnapped from Canning River after a police officer.
Canning Valen's sticker stayed dry when he pulled a man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth, who was home, tried to seduce the police when he found himself in a low, dry water only a few feet away from a policeman who tried to "suck him gently back to the sea".
The Canning Valen police were called to arrest Beckenham because of his unauthorized arrest.
When they found out that they were suspicious, this was trying to scare them off by heading to the Canning River.
But she didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water saying, 'Don't come out, come and get me'," said senior high-ranking officer Stradl Castledine.
Constapell Lachlan Perahac did not want to touch his uniform, so he used a safer tactic: "police negotiations".
"Sometimes people do funny things while they're trying to escape," said the senior high school officer Castledine.
The master football player Ben Cousins is an interesting example.
In 2006, Cousins turned his car off to avoid a fire and tried to get over Swan River.
He didn't succeed in his company, but he inspired locals to begin the design of the playmate Ben Cousins biothlon.
Peter Moody argues that the authorities are trying to convince him and threaten to stop the competition
Peter Moody has claimed that the Racing Victors have tried to convince her in the last year and threaten to stop the competition immediately.
She accuses the prosecutors and the Racing Victorian charity department, claiming that they have a personal campaign to launch against her. On Wednesday, Lady Tatay's late withdrawal due to the treatment action taken on Friday was the last one.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition and that he has faced a difficult situation after Lidar’s unexplained positive combination.
He has kept his tongue in the dark about the defendants for a year, and did not want it to look like a catacomb.
"I didn't mean to say anything about this, and I've been a long time late for the matter, but sometimes it gets so bad so much that everything goes wrong," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today, and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to go to my head and I want my owners to think I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they start thinking about each other, then I don't have to go on as a cook anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing to my license.
Earlier, Moody wrote a bomb racing.com site interview, where he said that the charity department had tried to cover his store.
"Third years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man, asking him about his name, and offering him a job with my girlfriend, if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a coward.
If that's the case, they'd really like to separate their agents, because they've failed in my arrest.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victorian, David Moodie, current President of Racing Victorian, and Bernard Saundry, current delivery director of Racing Victorian, were all aware of that and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is coming from a personal point of view?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to be a man, and maybe to transfer responsibility to others than the manufacturers for what's going on in the field?
Am I in trouble?
Am I in such a sad situation?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and work for me, and I'm not even sure if I'm going to make it possible for them to think about it right now.
But now I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and it's killing me.
It really does kill me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my eyes on this.
The manufacturer's deterioration has increased after a long-term cobalt study, and the late withdrawal made him realize that he could "break his license over the table".
Moody, known as the best winner of the preparation of Master Black Caviar, has called the rules on day-to-day treatment after having been put on horses' legs, which is contrary to the rules.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees was lying on the floor, but it was on his feet.
It could have been a funeral last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was Thursday.
Moody may have a three-month competitive ban due to the day-to-day hospital treatment for which the authorities initiated the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The carrier responsible for the transport package in Cobram was detained
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic accident in Cobram during the weekend.
The driver was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital when he was hit by a heavy storm when he was hit by a car at his Murray Valley State on Saturday morning.
The police told him that the driver was gone and didn't stop helping the driver with his ignition.
Today, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of neglecting an accident, of neglecting the aid, and of other traffic accidents.
The driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobrami, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Group manufacturer Craig Bellamy attacks competitors against pressure signals
Melbourne Storm's producer Craig Bellamy has also criticized the two NRL-rugbyli's metrician claims that his team's troops would be part of the "crazy".
Sydney Roosters, governor Trent Robinson, said that the various rooms of Storm's "pain" were on his side when it miraculously won a final victory in Sydney on Friday morning.
Brisbane Broncos, governor Wayne Bennett, was shocked to look at Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals tomorrow morning. Bennett called the game rugbylley as a "sample" and said that two of Queensland's teams were not "very excited" by the pressure.
Bellamy defended his team's orders and said they're just focusing on "contacts."
Bellamy added that his confidence added two leading preparatory criticisms to Storm, because it means that they fear their losing team.
"This is always going to be a talk - I didn't hear about the pressure on Trent Robinson when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or in our technical systems throughout the year, and in the last six weeks, we have only been in contact with the hostages, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been in a group for three years, and he has apparently a great team to prepare, so he probably has not been used to disappear, and this was a little bit of a coincidence to him.
It's funny how this is always going to talk about this year.
Bellamy challenged Bennet's idea of "adorable rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennet's preparation of St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010.
Wayne's talking about an exciting buggy.
He thought it was important to compare the game of Saturday night to our family night and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a tough team, and Wayne said it couldn't be less concerned.
But now he has a team that can play a bunch of ruckoos that we like to enjoy, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play that kind of game when you have that type of player.
He brought it back in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his nice rugbyy - not each group has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
I think it's more reliable when they say such things because they're a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks later, they probably didn't think of us as the answer to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Rooster was more spectacular than played between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game must have been a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more fields, but is it exciting?
Or will it cause the collapse of the defensive line and the uninterrupted destruction of the ground?
I've got this thing about lines.
If they mention us, it means that we can play against them somewhere.
Storm has been released this weekend because they have already won the right to a family member either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharksey against the first Saturday morning in the AAMI Park.
For Serbians 200 000 dollars for drug addiction
A man who threatens the possible life-threatening management company of 40 cocaine kilograms in Queensland has been released against $200,000.
At the age of 29, Marco Maximovic was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police had followed 100 kilograms of drugs for the Solay driver who came to South America through the U.S. and landed in Coomera in August.
Maximovic saw the other accused in the pool all along, and then he met them in the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximovicia is threatening the possible life-threatening business of the cocaine company, her lawyers claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic was trying to keep his entire volume in circulation and that he could be completely free from the cause of the coffee.
The Supreme Court of Justice, Peter Flanagan, was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong connections to Serbia.
She travels to Serbia several times," she told her right Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maximovic lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and father of Maximovic together had offered $200,000 worth of money to ensure her release.
"After I have seen the obvious evidence of both persons, it is clear that setting a $200,000 loan is a real economic burden for them," said Dr. Flanagan.
But it was not enough to prevent him from being unexplained before justice, he warned.
The ceiling was granted, provided that he would release the Australian passport and his Serbian passport, inform the police daily and maintain his foreign visa between midnight and morning.
Stefan Hogg used the girl's phone to call the pedophile to send pictures
Pedofil used a 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of the child’s approval.
Stefan Hogg took the girl to bed at night and then wrote her on the Internet service, where Hogg received a number of unwanted images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, found that the phone was missing and found her sleeping hand in Hoggin's hand.
The girl studied the phone and found a text message that she immediately told her mother about.
When the police came, they saw five pictures, studied the local computers, and found "careful" Web sites that had been used to search for unscathed images taken from children.
Hogg then said to the police that he had done this "fucking pedophile" on the Internet before he "showed himself to be a cop to scare them."
The representative of the Fiscal MP Elidhe Robertson told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that there is an addiction - that he is dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had made a tomb on the computer but said that they had been made just because he wanted to make a police officer so that he could save the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent pictures to him, and when Hogg asked the person to send more pictures.
Hogg said he did this only for food purposes.
She said she had to get out of the hospital, and she wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she cried to her mother, her grandfather, and her tears.
My mother saw unscathed images on the phone and then found a defendant.
The girl was questioned, and she said that the accused had used the computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who showed her from her youth.
The 23-year-old Hogg in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted his guilt for the preparation or adoption of images of innocent children on the last day of June 14th. He failed to learn on January 25th of this year and did not come to trial on March 24th of this year.
Advocate General Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia should not be a member of the register of sexual offenders, since it could be said that she did not belong to a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal appealed to the Court in October so that the social service would have time to prepare the reports.
Hoggy was given the benefits in this case, but in other cases he has been detained before processing.
He was added to the sexual offender's register before the date of trial.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was wrong to Parliament.
Former African leader Mugabe died earlier this year on the front lines of the speech circuit.
He didn't get hurt, but the video described as missing spread through the virus on social media.
Parliament's openings also wanted opposition legislators to claim that they had been subjected to anonymous killings, which warned them of being beaten by Mugabelle during his speech.
In the last month, they woke him up and stopped him in the middle of the morning to speak to Parliament about the state of the country - which I said again as a poet.
The Heads of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Group of Heads of the Innocent Gonese Group said that the seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, which warned them of disturbing them from the Mugaben language.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the search for the message is 'to die'," Gonese told the publishers after Mugaben spoke.
The Communication warned the Members concerned that the inconsistencies would end in Parliament, and when they stood outside, the inconsistencies would not be in force.
The group's supervisors said that the side that leads Morgan Tsvangira is "careful" threats to its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces even 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has saved 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its reorganisation and cost-sharing efforts in the company service.
This year, HP will be divided into two sponsors, apart from the faster growth of its computer and output business and services.
The expected job losses amount to about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, according to the HP report.
"These reorganisations will allow the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise to be more competitive and sustainable," said Meg Whitman, the president of HP and the delivery director of the unit following the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we have to have a guy and a lot more expensive services that help companies move into a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to be over $50 billion, and it's "focused to produce a comparison of integrated technology solutions for companies" is reported in company information.
How to start a company that was built by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard from Stanford University University. It works in a car located in Palo Alto, called "Pilaakson's Place of Birth".
HP has gone through a great reorganization to find out the transfer of traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is in the last area, based on the belief that strictly limited firms are doing better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support the defeat of Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb scale.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshir that it is now next September and that, assuming that he's suffocating in accordance with his plans, there's no reason why he wouldn't be playing again until December.
In this best case, Wilshire will remain between at least four of the next games in England, and taking into account her background, it is uncertain whether she will participate in the European masterminds first.
The biggest problem in this recent problem is that the end of Wilshire's last journey was a strong one-way skirmisher, and she remembered the old winter before the beginning of the journey.
"That's not a threat to you," Wenger said.
It's an idea that didn't improve.
It's nothing weird.
That was just an accident.
It doesn't matter what he's got or what he's got.
This may take its place from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger acknowledged, when the player tries to return to the center, there is always a risk of more.
There is also an inadequate model in the design.
Premier Injuries Ltd's research shows that Wilshere had 23 different tumors after she started debing six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has played 157 of Arsenal's play only 65 games.
In view of Arsenal's larger totality after 2007-08, in six months it was the second of the Valioligan's teams, who have lost most of the days due to fatigue.
Wenger gives the chance of an accident, but Arsenal believes that their final improvement continues to be in the cause of the epidemic.
"Sometimes when you get back from work, there can be a long time to strengthen your body and to win competition," Wenger said.
Jack's enough for a young man to get over it.
I hope his body is stable, I'm sure he's going to do it, and he's gonna make an egg like he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to rotate his team when Arsenal starts playing the Mesterian game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb and then playing Chelsea and the first Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspura.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably in the process.
Wenger can also place Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Montreal and Theo Waldo.
"I'm trying to keep balance and give it a boost to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear path to the F-class, the maximum stage in Zagreb is the most fear of Europe.
And Dinamo has not lost 41 jobs since they produced their "Infinite" campaign in the last time.
The stadium was held on Tuesday, with a force of 3.2 astute Richter.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has recently learned about the passing of the Magistrate against Monaco, and he has been motivated by a far-reaching scourge leading to its first victory in the European Cup.
"This motivation is great," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're very proud, but we're not victims.
FriendsFest: a comedian who taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is remarkable how no similar images exist, especially when it is taken into account that the need for men is greater than ever before, and that the suicide rates for young men are higher than those for five years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest death in 20-45-year-olds in Britain, and it is three times more common than in women.
The company's problem with Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) was announced by men in 2015. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevented men from applying for help when needed.
Friendship is in the face of this challenge.
In a recent study, there were more than 2,000 high school and school-age students who showed signs of fatigue. According to the study, the possibility of a person getting double if he had a high percentage of his friends was "healthy".
Similarly, those who were not discouraged were given the chance to expose possible mental health problems if they thought they were healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
Through this social media, the style of communism is going to end, and the urgency of the response is often more important than important contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to have a strong, happy and successful effect, even though it is actually governed by speciality.
The values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this happens at the cost of personal growth and friendship in the internal values that affect our mental health.
And as the billionaire video player explained otherwise, the money does not really get greater happiness.
Freddie's beauty was just that it turned this focus on.
No fraud has defined their work but, above all, their personality, which was clearly distinguished as friends in the interaction.
The desires of Joey and Chandler, the moments that I'm looking forward to looking at a football match, the Russians, at Rachel's worst, came to realize that, yes, men can do the same for all of this, even though they often hesitate to investigate their feelings completely.
As the volunteer worker of the Samaritan organization explained to me: "When I hear people who are tired and selfish, I really understand how little interaction with a friend can improve the situation."
Often, men who contact us experience that they can't talk to their friends.
The old idea of getting out is strong, just as you know that if there's a problem, it's going to be a failure.
Friends are one of those barriers that come to mind when I try to offer longer-term solutions.
It's a little bit of a man's friendship.
Although my second way of helping people at a time when they are in need of assistance is by far the closest, personal support from the family and friends network.
And if you've been participating in Comedy Central FriendsFesti this weekend, and all the photos are scheduled for the party's honor, what kind of wine are your friends in Central Perki.
Or what's better if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent by Comedy Central at the end, all 236 sections, participating in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes the map and helps PSG to get past Malmö's page
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made a world over the Master's budget to help the PSG end up as Malmö's diamond.
I'll get you a report and you'll react to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were right on the line when Paris Saint-Germain began at the end of the Master's game with a pleasant 2-0 battle against Malmö in Parc des Princes.
Di Maria made a four-minute tour of the Mestars at the debey of the day, showing French crewmen the way, but the team lost many opportunities before finally added its success in the aged Cavan day 61.
Paris, which is in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetskin, needed a strong base against the Swedish league, because the game was not only a continuation, but also an improvement to their quadrennials in the final three rounds.
But even though PSG takes points, there was no classic copy, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic broke the place before the ground and later was moved from the field. Malmö is his old home town team and it's the group where he started to destroy his urine in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at home, so 2-0 will produce problems for the opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we have to do this distance a little," Blanc said.
This was supposed to be good.
We wanted to win and win, even though we have not succeeded in doing one or two more ways.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after a three-minute shift after the team remained in the 2-2-tazalic League 1 home against Bordeaux for a week, but he remained in the fourth minute at Di Maria's shelter.
When he moved from Manchester United in the last month, an Argentineian activist was appointed as a man who took the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when Marco Verratt's food was caught behind the Malmö defense line and after that, a beautiful last blow by Johan Wilden stopped the network.
However, if someone expected the PSG to be easy and successful, he had to be disappointed.
Malmö was a supportive opponent, and it won Celtic's solution to save this level, its open-ended international player and five-man defenses, and two players in a heart-to-heart middle.
But the team did not offer the attack on the side of the attack just as much as Nikola Djurdjizic's 34-minute strike, which took the knife off Kevin Trapp's sword.
Instead, the PSG had to go between the sides of the plane because of the damages and the latter, especially Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five companies only by the first half and then failed when Cavani put a bullet in the contact with Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half of the company.
However, he was much more effective in presenting his work to his colleagues, and just from the food of Ibrahimovic Di Maria, he sent a tour of the railway, which took place in about 52 minutes.
A second land was finally obtained after an hour’s game due to a six - country skirmish of Cavan after Ibrahimovic had appeared on the left side of Maxwell’s cross.
The hopes of Malmö were finally realized to return to the game, and only the great fight by Wildan from the direct defeat of David Luiz took the final numbers below before Ezequiel Lavez was rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö's producer Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was the same level higher than his team. The Norwegian said, "The last time we played on the Master's game was in December."
After that, we've only played on the street of Sweden, which is not the same.
It's not enough to burn.
I'm going to take it to Paris.
This was a great game for them.

Matt Damon reduces the difference in the film
Matt Damon joined an African filmmaker with Effie Brown in their discussion of the difference that Damon doesn't need behind the scenes.
In HBO's solar-day project Greenlight, an experienced indicator highlighted Brown's need for different aspects of the project to be addressed to the dark headline of the selected project.
"When we speak of differences, it will be taken into account when selecting samplers in the film, not listed," Damon said.
The following Brown responded in disbelief, comments "Oho! Wow. Okei", while the comments of The Martinian's indicator remained unchanged.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined the finals of the series of discussions between Damon and Brown.
"I want to invite people to think about who any leader is then how they deal with Harmony's personal shame," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark smell is the noise of his white partner.
The Dear White People's producer demanded the film's rights to guide finals Leo Angelos and Kristen Branccio; Damon firmly replied that their guidance "should be given to us something we don't want".
When the debate was launched, the social media broke down Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his opinion about the film scene by writing: "Matt Damon speaks of the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is NIIN VALKOIST that it is. "
After its publication, the petition collected more than 5000 reconnaissances and 4000 petitions.
Damon's comments are part of a time when the precise presentation of the media is in the interest of the social debate.
After the White Police killed young Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter was distributed worldwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop the use of colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement by presenting the album of the Year's album as the recipient of Grammy's award.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black animals, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Live Matter movement would soon publish an opinion to answer the Fox News TV series by Elisabeth Hasselbeck on whether the group should be a group of enemies.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
On the contrary, it was said that Damon is involved in a group of conspirators, producers, and mediamotives who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the west.
It's not clear whether he's accepted an invitation or he's already met with a priest.
First American Ninja Warrior Crushed
The professional and professional champion Isaac Caldiero became the first to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, and was awarded a million-dollar prize.
At the end of its seventh stage, the competition programme has never been a competitor, which would have clarified all aspects of the programme's exclusion.
In the last section of the series of two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, found the last round.
The last task was to speed up about 23-metre weight in 30 seconds.
The British raced first and solved the challenge at a time when he became the first player of all time, who discovered part 4 of American Ninja Warrio's refurbishment. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds earlier, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave a challenge to E!News after a difficult victory and was still in shock about winning a million-dollar prize.
"Then this is a great idea when I've never known or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his father's paycheck.
But at the same time... I can't even imagine what this is going to be... the future is unknown.
Producer President Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter fine and why Britten gets more paychecks, although he is the first competitor of all times, who has succeeded in crossing the line.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, you get the money that has the quickest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and a change in life, it is a feeling of great satisfaction.
I don't think she feels pretty about it.
He's just so happy that he's been able to do what he did.
His girlfriend's been over her.
He's a great guy and a good family.
He's his children and his wife's hero.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return to the eight-way route to which the pictures are started in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tiger's hip, Minnesota Twins.
MINEAPOLIS -- The other side of the street has not been too happy for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball groups, but is now the latest in the American League Central division.
Tigers showed his role as a pilot when it won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get up at the top of Houston Astros in the competition of the second American League Wild Card.
For Detroit, at least one evening, the game was back to the six-year-old H pair, which had been very difficult to reach most of the next half of the year.
"All the victories are fun, regardless of how they may be won," said military commander Brad Ausmus.
The tigers, Alfredo Simon, continued his early attack when Detroit took the course three times in the first two days, and then in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) ran 6 1/3 daily and saved three rounds.
This was against his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," said Simon.
It's hard for a changeman to play every game, and that's why I want to go to a deep game.
The Tigers of Tigers, Victor Martinez, received three and possibly two courses that were his first rounds after midnight of August.
This was Martinez's first three rounds the night after he hit Seattle on July 6th.
"He smelled a lot of honey," Ausmus said.
He seemed good (in painting) and looked much better in painting and continued to play the same model.
The Twins were three years later on the last half of the seventh anniversary, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
St. Byron Buxton started at the top of the bridge two steps out on the left side of the road.
Aaron Hicks went home on one of his tracks, and Simon got burned directly to the other player Brian Dozier before Simon was transferred to the left side of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy conducted Maurea, the only anti-sustainment player in front of the leading deputy, Miguel Sãoa, who would cut the two to the left of the true Drew VerHagen.
With two holes on the ground and two on the floor of the adjustable compartment, VerHagen received a three-way Trevor Plouffen to cut the ground leading to the toppleline.
There was a forecast of the winner: 27 times this time, when Plouffe hit the topple.
After Detroit had been given a nine-way insurance undertaking, Mauer would kick two cuts in the course of Tigers' closure against Bruce Rondonia, and the situation was 5-4.
The real player, however, burned Sano's three meals at five in his rescue.
Detroit used Phil Hughes at the beginning to accept the invitation.
Tigers received three courses in the first two rounds against the true veteran player, who got away from the list of amateurs before the game was gone for more than a month because of the comeback.
"I apparently didn't want to start with this," Hughes said, "but in front of the game my life was more pleasant, and I felt that I had made some nice things on the third day."
After Hughes hit the first ball on the first ball, he gave the second player Ian Kinsler one step forward.
J.D. Martinez's behavior on two sides led to Victor Martinez, who took himself to the middle class and led to the first phase of the game.
Victor Martinez would break down his 0-21-puppets in good running mode.
The third-party player Nick Castellanos continued to cut to the right and cause another race, but his dangerous situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected while he tried to move forward to the third-party.
Tigers continued on the other side of the boat and got one ball, in the case of James McCann, and in the case of two arrows, in the case of Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important legend," said the chief of the Twins, Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very good at it, but it flew right to him.
Hughes started to be a fireman and a third driver of the runaway race, after which he became the rightful successor of A.J. A. A. A.
The Hughes were counted three steps from six steps and four steps along the deck.
HOW YOU ARE: Anibal Sanchez, the true killer of Tigers, had to be removed because of a hurricane.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews, who ran away from Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of broken marriages since mid-August due to an emergency, but he had to be back in midweek.
While outside Sanchez, the left-hand driver Daniel Norris will be on the list of missing ones to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in the fourth round following the exchange of left-wing poet David Price on 30 July.
Norris has been outside since 20 August due to the outbreak of a proper wine vassal.
The series of Tigers and Twins' three games ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is located in Minnesota against Ervin Santanaa (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
