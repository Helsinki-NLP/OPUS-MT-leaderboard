Ready?
Listen to me.
Because they're watching TV.
I'm hungry.
I hate Tom for a lot of reasons.
Great!
Don't worry about anything.
It's just a word.
Squad.
Sometimes it's necessary to hide the truth.
Soup is too hot. I can't eat it.
Tommy warned Mary that she had to do it today.
Do Tom really have to do that today?
It's a precious tomb.
Tom is that guy?
Who knows?
Follow me.
Let's get to work on our own.
Did you eat Prig?

How long have you been talking to Tom?
Tonight, I'm free.
You have a lovely eye, don't you?
Why would Tom do that today?
It's very good last night.
It's mine.
It's the truth.
Now you're busy.
I like you.

Now I don't have time.
Tom says he's happy to do it.
I won't do that.
I like your offer.
Do you think Tom can help us?

That's great!
I need you.

And you should fear Him, and they should worship you.
Social change is what's needed there.
What's Tom got to do?
He decided to be a pilot.
How's Australia?
I can't believe it!
I can't help you, even if I hurt you.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Please don't eat too much.
I've got a lot to do.
Are we gonna watch the movie now?
The real problem is you don't even know we have a problem.
Are you really telling that to Tom?
This is the mouth.
Did I eat the chicken last night?
I can't eat this.

Some say that we shouldn't check the e-mail first thing in the morning.
I have time.
I'll try to make some food.

I'm not going to die.
What do you want?
Where are you going? We've got a lot of time, so we're safe.
The air is thick, and the earth is flat.
What kind of person are you?
It's a beautiful life.

What are you talking about?
How many friends do you have?
Frees!

He ran.
What is it?
Help Tom.
Tom's in school?
I'm a father, a mother.
I don't know how I can do it.
Find a job.
Why can't you come?
No one except Tom did that.
I like the Arandby song.
How old are you?
Once, there was a bridge here.
Do you want to do it with me?
Wow!
I'm a cop.
There's a way out.
Tom's gone.
Is your mom okay?
Whenever I find something I like, it's gonna be too hard.
You missed that, didn't you?
I have the right to judge.
I miss you.
I've been trying to look at the side all the time.
We'll go there at 2:30.
Arabic will read from the right to the left
That's what Tom said.
She's laughing.
He's got a lot of money.
You can't stay without water.
I won't say that.
This is a dog.
I've seen Yufo's plane.
I don't blame you.
Mary's dog is bigger than Mary's dog.
I'm going.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
We have a problem, too.
I'm sick.
Let's do it.
Why do you ask?
Can I borrow some books?
It's TV.
A dictionary is the basis of language.
She's a bitch.
I can't eat.
Answer the question.
What do you want from me?
How can Tom do that?
That looks nice. I'll try.

Someone gave you your clothes.
They opened the door.
It's okay.
I'm a teacher.
I'm a psychopath.
I'm fine.
You should let Tom do what he wants to do.
No problem.
She was afraid that Megan would kill her husband before their grandson was born.
Any work that can cause a lot of suffering.
I'll be fine.
He used to suck when he was a kid.
Yeah.
I think it's best if you don't.
I was in him then.
This is the moon.
She's pregnant.
He believed they destroyed it.
Tom says Mary's coming in for dinner.
Do you like Mary?
The clock has two hands.
We're going over the river.
Be careful.
It's fine.
I like him.
You look great.
You're so hot with me.
He likes revenge.
Tom's lying.
I can't eat meat.
The car's here.
We're the one.
I wonder what Tom's got to do with that.
Please open this box.
Have you ever seen how to make a spell?
You won't like this.
Don't waste your time on bullshit.
It's impossible!
Who's Tom?
I'll go there even if the rain falls.
Look at me when I talk to you!
Write down something.
This word has two meanings, but situation one is a very bad day.

Santa's in the north.

You're tired, aren't you?
I can't go.
Tom has three children.
The virus is spreading rapidly.
In the worst case, we'll have to be as happy as we can.

The football could stop because of the rain.
Let's do it!
Do you drink coffee?
What do you want me to do with these things?
You should have knocked the door before you came in.
Answer me.
Let's consider what's the worst that could happen.
I can't go.
No new book.
Are you tired?
He's gone. He's gone.
In Canada, people speak English and French.
You're not gonna do it?
I found what she was looking for.
He doesn't know anything.
It's time for Tom to wake up.
No, I lost my passport!
Most of us want to do that.
1. It's a statement to make a choice. 2. To give money to the head or the tail.
Bye-bye!
It's not my fault.
He's drunk.
It's raining.
Are you writing a letter?
Hi, my name is Tom.
What do you mean?
I'll go with Tom and Mary.
Tom doesn't speak French.
She's gonna make a good wife.
Is that you?
Tom doesn't want to talk to Mary.
We'll eat lunch together at half a month.
Tomme.
Should we do this?
I'm looking for someone who's wearing clothes for me.
How does that relate to me?
Coved-19 changed the patient's cell to the virus factory.
In the summer I went to the sea, in the winter I went to the mountains.
Have fun.
I wonder why Tom didn't come to Mary's party.
I'm a Thai.
Keep away from the hands and eyes of the child.
Hold it!
Can I help you?
He ran.
Who?
The construction began on October 20, 2556.
I'm awake.

Tomlock's room.
What does Tom want?
What's the cost of the phone?
I'm going to school.

Tom wants to do that.
Catch Tom.
My mom's been sick for months.
The hunter's not far from here.
It's his.
He's sleeping like a kid.
"Thank you." "It's okay."
You guys want some water or coffee?
Tom wants you to do it.
Where did you come from?
I love you.
Do you have a mouth in the car?
What time is it now?
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
My job just started.
All men are born of Israel, and there is one law and one law. All men are lawful and righteous, as I said to you.
I'm the breadmaker.
Why me?
Tom's lying.
Allow students to lose school.
Where is he?

Tom.
Tom bought the best thing in the store.
He's looking at kids, but he's really over forty years old.
She's walking.
I've finished reading this book.
I still speak Indonesian.

This is what's always happened.
Do you like milk?
We agree.
I like eating apples.
I'm going to learn French for a while.
I'll try not to be late tomorrow.
Tom hasn't cleaned up yet.
I love you more than you love me.
I lost my wallet.
Your clock is ten minutes late.
Tom ran.
Tom and I are fine.
I refused to stay in Boston until Monday.
It's cold.
If you fail to plan, you're planning to fail.
I feel deep inside you.
I only have one book.
It's not your business.
Tomorrow he'll walk out of Chicago.
I'm looking around.
I hope we didn't wake you up.
I don't know if there's any time.
You should learn more.
We're okay.
What does Tom need?
I'm a wind.
He doesn't have a child.
Tomga.
I don't know she's so old.
Open the video.
Do you like Japanese food?
Don't do that.
Who are you?
My mother's gone crazy.
I wonder where Tom's going to take the picture.
I don't eat apples.
Tom and Mary have to do that?
Is that from Tom?
My mother opened the door carefully.
Of course!
Why didn't Tom come last night?
Every morning I go out to shopping.
I can't live like that.
Are these yours?
That's it.
I'm sorry.
Where is he?
Give me two days.
I think it's the best way.
What do you think of Tom's blog?
I'm afraid they're not so good together.
I'm sorry. I can't go.
How lonely would this world be without you?
This neck is all right.
We got a lot more answers.
I'll let things go as they are in order to avoid problems.
It's hot last night.
Let's go find a job.
Where are you?
You'll be honored.
He's always eating breakfast here.
The birds are in the sky.
Tom and his brother have a very different personality.
They're like family.
Mike's in his body two to three times a week.
We should get together.
That's not okay.
I wouldn't drink it if I were you.
I ate apples.
I get it.
I'm not a doctor.
How do we do that?
I like chess.
It's hard to take an interest in breaking the rules.
I'm a professional.
The password is "Muiriel."
What do we do with Tom?
Our school won't let us see the movie alone.
Tom wanted to do that, didn't he?
You did what you had to do.
Jerusalem is the capital of the country of Palestine.

Helen Keller is blind, deaf, and blind.
There's a snake in the garden.
Tomwad this picture by himself?
I saw him running.
I'm afraid we'll be too late.
Is your mother at home?
I asked the people around me, and everyone said Tom was a good person.
Have you ever seen the sun rise? It's beautiful.
We're going to the hunt.
In the end, I have the courage to tell her, "I love you!"
Where are you going?
I hope I can do it myself.
I'm a surgeon. I'm a medical student.
Can that work?
You're so brave.
I'm not all tired.
I'm tired.
Too hot. I can't eat it.
I can't speak Japanese.
I'm getting water.
Stop laughing.
There's no teeth.
Can you keep it secret?
I saw something moving out there.
I'm not going with you.
Hello!
Pray, pray, pray.
Two months ago, I had an experience at work.
- 30 euros. - Yes.
Help me.
Listen.
We'll eat lunch together at half a month.
I think he's my brother.
The food finally arrives on the table.
I'm from Budapest.
Who do you mean?
Hello to the world.
That's enough!
Okay, then.
Call the police!
Oh, my God, I'm a businessman.
It's time to go to sleep.
I'm jealous.
For oral use.
I don't know if there's any time.
We went to the press to study Japanese history.
Squeeze out of your face.
Please send your home.
You speak English.
We can't do that right now.
Tom likes it there.
I like Chinese food.
Have you eaten?
Social development has changed in every country.
Is this the book you're looking for?
Most people write about their daily lives.
Sheir!
I used to have a horse.
Tom said something wrong about me.
You're a smoker.
Tom's thoughts were prompted.
No one invited me.
There's nothing that's done except the crash.
Ask a woman anywhere.
Sit down.
She's better than me.
Tom didn't expect this.
Color is appropriate for you.
I want to try it.
I'm not going to school.
Tell Tom.
Good evening.
Catch him.
This is Japan.
He's just a politician.
Are you pregnant or just pregnant?
It's a lie. It's a lie.
I won't be happy, but I won't kill myself.
We'll eat lunch together at half a month.
I don't know if you know, but in America, you're supposed to give the baby a job.
Am I wrong?
I want to tell La.
Is this your car?
Are you okay?
This is my book. It's his ring.
We're fine.
He kept his promise.
It's kind of weird for me.
We're kidding.
What did they say?
What are you and Tom doing?
How'd you find a job?
Tom's running.
I'd like to go play in the theater.
What?
Tell me the time.
Take Tom.
We should celebrate.
Everything's ready.
What are you doing?
Please come in. Open the door.
It won't happen.
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan to do that.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Tom might know Mary.
The easiest way to solve the problem is always the best way.
It's done!
I hope you can come with us.
Why weren't we told the truth?
A lot of people like to travel.
Russia is worse than the superstar.
The fires.
You're not a businessman.
I don't want to go.
When did the mistake happen?
One can always find time.
I'll be right back.
You should be sleeping.
Call me.
Don't be impatient.
I'll sign it for you.
Is it yours?
Tom wants to see Mary.
I want to say something.
1 March was the day that many Japanese went to court.
I'm not a member of this club.
Happy Christmas!
Do you want to reduce it?
I'm a faggot.
Don't worry about it. Life's going up and down.
Tom's got a hate in his coffee instead of a cold.
Do you eat coffee?
Which is the smallest star?
Wait.
Tom has to go now?
I know Tomgren.
We're gonna be okay.
Ready?
Listen.
Their apples aren't ours.
I hope my teacher will encourage me to work.

Water.
I'm so tired.
I said I'd go.
Meredith was Mary's friend.
Tom paid.
Money is money.
What do you want?
I agree.
Son of a bitch.
The point is, okay, we're done. Okay, then.
We all have to die, whether we have money or not.
You're making me tired!
Actually, the man you saw was a woman.
I want to do it right away.
We'll be okay.
My sword needs to talk.
If you pay the rent after the 5th day, you're gonna be paid up and you're gonna be set up.
There's something I need to know.
Your mouth!
I want to go with you.
Tom drove Mary to the airport.
How are you in school?
She told La.
There's no way!
Hello, Tom.
Take a break.
Aren't these your books?
They live as if they were hungry.
There are many islands in the sea.
He's proud of himself.
I'm Tom in Boston.
In the past, every child could separate himself from others.
My mother is a professor of psychology.
Shut up!
Say it!

Why are you crying?
No! No!
You may be too busy that makes you sleep unsatisfied.
I'm lying.
Her name is Maria.
Tell her I'll call back later.
Not enough language.
Let's go.
That's it.
How many hours are you going to travel?
God who gives us life and freedom at the same time.
Tom always sees everything in the brain.
Let's go now.
No one's with Tom.
Tom's gone.
I'm staying.
I need you.
I'm watching TV.
What's her name?
That man's army has never been successful in fighting.

I used to speak Russian.
Except for the distance from every vehicle and take other angles between the vehicle.
We're eating apples.
Did you come back from Japan?
He must be my sister's good husband.
I need love.
They're gone.
Squeeze out of your face.
Drop it.
Are you married yet?
Who cares?
Can you have anything in the fridge that I eat?
How's Tom?
My son wants to talk.
Tom has a farm near Boston.
Are you sure?
He left the team because he didn't get in with the manager.
Tom's on his way fast.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
You mustn't believe it!
I used to speak Russian.
No, the house in my village isn't high, but the big garden.
I'm English.
I'll try not to interfere with your study.
Go away!
What I want is love.
What are you talking about?
Me, too.
Tom's doing that.
Is this the last picture?
Most of us have to do that.
How did you find a mistake?
Thank you. I'll be right there.
What's going on?
I've seen hard trees in the yard.
I'm tired a lot.
I'll sell this dog if it's higher.
How's your dad?

Sleep on the couch.
Most people think I'm crazy.
It's Tom.
Where did you go to Australia?
That way.
Tom likes to do that.
Are you there?
Come in.
Overcrowding.
The side effects of the surgery are the eyelids.

I sold food in Australia.
I like watching movies.
I don't have any money.
Even though he's gonna apologize, I'm still angry.
You're a kid.
I don't want to go to school.
It's a new train.

What about you?
I want to do good things in the future.
She's wrong.

We're his children.
My mailbox is full.
Come here.

Totoro says Totoro can't speak Chinese.
The center line of the hole is smaller than that.
Tom's eating sandwich for lunch or not.
They should apologize.
Is it always a mistake or a long time ago? Is it the same mistake?
I have to go to bed.
Do you want a stick tonight?
Tom and his brother have a very different personality.
Have you ever come home?
Are you crazy?
Is it raining?
We're gonna be okay.
You look so excited.
What's this?
What are you looking at?
I'll miss Tom.
Jew, Christian, or Muslim, we are the sons of God.
Please be happy!
Clear
Please tell me the way to the station.
Tom's sitting in the dark, smoking.
Tom taught French.
They're mine.
Where did I get the keys?
I don't like that name.
I hope he'll be fine.
I get it.
I'm focusing on that.
I'm in pain.
I'm Brazilian and I don't know any other language than my own language.

As soon as I left the house, I met her on the street.
You can't read these books. It's not good for you.
For what?
What are you doing here?
Get out!
It's no surprise for me.
Is that what Tom said?
Go away.
Tom remembers Mary as soon as he saw her.
I'm a cancer.
I've been reading a lot of Ton's books in the past.
Anyone likes him.
