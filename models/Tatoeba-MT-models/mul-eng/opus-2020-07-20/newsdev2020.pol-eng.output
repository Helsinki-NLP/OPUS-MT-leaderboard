Bosnia and Herzegovina is protesting Croatia's plans for the storage of waste from landfills.
In the fifth century, hundreds of people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in protest against the plans of the nearby Croatia to store parts of waste from one in the nuclear power region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
The protesters in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad asked Croatia to punish the plans to build a warehouse of wastes in former military camps in the town of Tragovska Gora and declared war on the project.
In the facility, wastes from nuclear power could be stored.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which holds banners with the letters "The Healthy Future" and "The Stop – (the river) It needs us", said that the composition of the mining waste could endanger the Union's resources and life of about 250 000 inhabitants.
We have to say NO,
He told the tribe of Miroslav Drljaca, the mayor of the Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, the Kristko power plant built in the 1980s is also located in Croatia.
Representatives of both countries shall meet next week to discuss additional waste stocks.
The Croatian public television HRT announced on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided whether to build the waste warehouse on its own or to pay for the spare parts of waste in the new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatia's Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told the journalists that Croatia also has a problem with eliminating institutional wastes from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes of finding a complete solution.
In Bosnia, officials and residents from each side of the country of ethnic division were forced to find another location in the nearby country.
"Why does Croatia, throughout its territory, say that it is the best place to go to Bosnia?" he asked Drljaca.
We can't let them down!

American Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The U.S. Congress, by the law of 15 days after the approval by the Department of State for the possible purchase by Poland, did not object to this transaction, which means that the last conditions were met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress's decision, although not surprising, is of great political importance.
"After the approval of the sale by the Department of State, and now by Congress, I do not see any major obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior policy adviser for the Washington, Conservative tank of Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that the Federal Government, represented by the Department of State, is required to inform Congress of any planned sale of weapons within 15 days of the signing of the contract if the value of such transaction, in the case of the sale of weapons to NATO Member State, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed transaction purchases 32 F-35 thinkers by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance costs, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main F-35 aircraft supplier – if this transaction is finally finalised – will be the American Lockheed Martin army group, and its double-manufacturer is the manufacturer of engines for the F-35A Pratt and Whitney Group.
The proposals for buying American thinkers of the fifth generation F-35, on behalf of the Polish government, were submitted in May by the Minister of Defence, Mariusz Blassek.
Poland's offer was discussed in June of this year at a meeting of President Andrzey Dudy with President Donald Trumpe in the White House.
On the implementation of this agreement, if it is finalised, the representatives of the Pentagon will feel under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
Under the FMS programme Poland has already acquired, among other things, an anti-bacterial system Patriot.
The price of one F-35 thinker at the time the offer was made by Poland – without equipment and technical assistance – was around $89.2 million.
As U.S. military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity informed PAP, the price given in earlier negotiations was “the maximum price, much higher than the price to be paid”.
"The prices fall strongly, the price of one F-35 is now below $80 million, much less than Eurofighter costs, which does not have such stocks as F-35," said Venable.
The PAP speakers expressed the hope that the final negotiations on the purchase by Poland of US warplanes will be concluded this year.
The possible share of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – i.e. offset – will be discussed directly with American thinkers F-35.
What is the role of the Münchhausen group, which is referred to in the “Payton Hobart” series on the Netflix platform?
Caregivers and parents with the above disorder believe their child’s health is sick.
The series “Selection of Payton Hobart” is currently available on Netflix platform.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States, but first, he has to be the head of the academic self in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, American Horror Story and Glee, we see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platta and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, he goes on to the theme of Münchhausen’s successor group – mental illness in caregivers who act as if the health of the person concerned were affected by physical or mental illness.
There are various types of this disorder, such as the Munchhausen group, which is responsible for causing symptoms of this disease.
The successor of the Münchhausen Group is to simulate that the person who remains under our care has certain durability.
It is also called a deliberate and communicable disease, and it is treated as violence against the child.
It's a rare disorder that usually involves a parent who is healing symptoms or causing symptoms, so it looks like his child is sick.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen's successor team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS takes into account the following examples of behaviour:
To convince a medical person that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Efficacy or feeling of symptoms.
Falsifying the results to make the child feel sick, e.g. glucose to try to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Efficacy of symptoms of disease, e.g. by administering medicines and other substances to children.
How often does Münchhausen's replacement team occur?
It is difficult to assess how often this disorder occurs because many cases of disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 shows that 89 cases of this disorder have occurred in over two years for 100,000 people.
What should be done if there are doubts that a child may be in danger?
Contact the local department of special services or call the NSPCC Child Protection Informationline by choosing number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Nalut police at school in Kadunia, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – Posterunek of the State Police in Kaduni held yesterday at the school of Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma in Riga, Igabi, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.

Before the adoption of the children to the school, the parents signed a form.
Each day, parents brought their children food and knew what the conditions were.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as the removal of the entire food supply provided by parents before the school was closed.
That's not right, because parents can prove that their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Police Commissioner Abdulrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of care for children, never had any reservations.
He believed that the children were studying the Qur'an and nothing else.
However, police specialist Posterunku Public Relations, Yakubu Sabo, acknowledged that after the government was transferred, children would join their parents.
‘They are held in humane conditions in the name of the subordination or acquisition of the original knowledge.
Many of them were close on their feet, proving that it was a bit of a bit.
That's why we're also studying the school to get to know her owner," he added.

He was shot in a masculinating glass and dragged him to school 12-year-olds from the back and brought him to the middle Coast in May 2017.
Then he took her to the tree and raped her.
Shortly after his arrest, a search warrant was issued in his home where the officers kept a number of important items for the investigation.

Paper calls for executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, the French paper warned executive directors of technology, diplomats and finance companies that, as a result of the creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement, there is a risk of increasing social inequality if, in its course, the labels do not take into account the common good.
Pope Francis made those words at a conference in the Vatican where representatives of governments and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics, attended.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference, see “The Common Good in the Digital Age”.
This trend is the latest evidence that Watykan is interested in participating in the debate on the perspectives and risks associated with artificial intelligence.
The technological achievements in the field of military art and the future of work have been discussed, with the increasing role of machinery being played, and the case study of the closure in Christchurch in New Zealand, and decisions taken by companies that are the owners of social media in relation to the distribution of the film of the registration mask.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution have saved workers from dangerous and monotonous work.
He noted, however, that increasingly dependent on robotic devices in order to achieve achievement is the risk of losing people's dignity from work.
"If technological progress would be contributing to more and more apparent inequality, it would not be a real and real step," he said.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind would become an enemy of good commonness, it would lead to an unwanted invasion of some kind of barbarity under the most powerful law.
The organizers of the conference expressed the hope of benefiting from the expertise of the participants and identifying possible future Catholic councillors in high-tech matters.
Martin Odegaard, an employee hired by Real Madryt, puts the fans in the euphoria with his effective ass.
Martin Odegaard noticed an impressive assistant at opening Michael Oyarzabal's throat.
Winning 2:0 with Osasun, Real Madryt stood on the top of the La Ligi table and continues to be unwelcome in his own forest during the same season.

Vinícius Junior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in the team.
However, this was the Norwegian player Martin Odegaard, who was awarded the Real Society, causing a great defeat, putting an incredible ass in the game La League.
During the meeting of the Real Society with Alaves Martin Odegaard, Michael Oyarzabal and Real Society finally won 3:0 before his own show.
After removing the ball from the right hand side, Martin Odegaard ordered a player from the opposite team, placing a net at him, and then sent an amazing contribution to the centimetres between two other professionals and his colleague from the team just to get his leg.
The second flag of William Jose and the third in the execution of Oyarzabal, together with the prison row, provided a decisive victory for Imanol before Manu Garcia was sent out from the woods five minutes before the end of the game.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid recently as a 16-year-old in 2015, but he had a hard time trying to stop waiting for fans.
Now, at 20 years of age, the Norwegian gunman seems to feel certain in the bush.

The king’s adviser, judge Jeremy Richardson, said to the couple: “I will never be able to express myself perfectly in words as you have done.
You're so full of shit. They're talking about themselves.
The murder of two children.
The attempt to kill four children and the whole talk to get rid of them.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be punished for the multiple punishment of life's deprivation of freedom at the appropriate time."
The Court decided that it would be a free-of-occupation penalty without the possibility of a conditional release.
The auction will be held on 12 November.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police authority in relation to a close relationship with businessman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent authority of the IOPC police procedure shall examine the possibility of bringing an action against the investigating prime minister whether, in the course of making a public office as mayor of London, he has been allowed to commit a criminal offence.
The Council of Great London (GLA) announced that its supervisory inspector had registered a "primary issue" in relation to the allegations of Arcuri's preferential treatment of his or her intimate knowledge.
‘The ‘consequential issue’ can be said when information indicates the possibility of committing a crime’ – he said.
It doesn't mean that it's somehow proved.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue was addressed to IOPC, which is responsible for the charges against the members of the police in England and Wales.
She was transferred to this police control body because Johnson was then responsible for the position of the Police Commissioner and the Criminal Commissioner.
Johnson objected that his close relationship with Arcuri would lead to any misunderstanding.
He said earlier that he would apply to the Council of the City of London and give details on his relations with Arcuri, but he insisted that the Council “he was in the wrong situation”.
The order is followed by “The Sunday Times” that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received $126,000 from the budget, and was also granted access to three foreign trade missions on which he was then the mayor of Johnson.
As a result of this transfer, the government frozen the contribution of 100 000 pounds to the Hacker House business at the time of the trial.
The Court is waiting to ask difficult questions about the audit procedure carried out prior to the recognition of the fund.
Minister of Audit Matt Warman said at the Gmin Election that his department's employees "constantly maintained due diligence" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to numerous references to the number, they were transferred to the office in California, where Arcuri currently lives at 34 years of age.
A close relationship of the prime minister with a businesswoman was "for a secret police officer".
The GLA decision to assign the prime minister to an independent IOPC police office met with an unsatisfied at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the higher level of the government, it is a "political motivated action", and its term, prior to the Conservative Party's Conference, is "publicly political".
"The Supervisor did not present any evidence confirming the award, and the prime minister did not receive the opportunity to give him an answer before the release of a press release late Friday evening," says the source.
Neither citizens nor the media can resort to such a clear political constitution.
Earlier today, the newspaper The Standard said that a close relationship between Johnson and a businesswoman from California, who helped the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was for the "secret police" staff.
The employees of the London & Partners Agency (L&P) mentioned above that Arcuri received places during the foreign trade routes of Johnson as a Burmese, although its company was then not considered "believable".
Third accused of a drug crime in connection with the death of Mac Miller
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the minor death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and sentenced to a death penalty for drug crimes.
According to the documents of the court, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling seized oxycodon pills produced by fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year as a result of the accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, which is a strong opioid responsible for “epedemia”, which has caused thousands of human beings to die in the United States.
Walter complains about the supply of pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents published on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter through the whole of the Serbs.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of fulfilling Walter's role as a “curier” who provided Petitto's pills.
None of the men mentioned were charged directly about the cause of Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defense in their case.
Walter, subject to the 2005 drug release, has been arrested and has also been sentenced to five months' imprisonment.
Critics who are concerned about the issue that she first brought to the fourth website dedicated to TMZ cells are hoping that Walter will be arrested in waiting for the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the fugitive being charged.
The response to the message left to the automatic secretary of his lawyer has not come from time to time.
Petitto was arrested in federal court on 4 September, and his defense denied his comment.
The words taken from Miller's creations are a real talk about his depression and the use of drugs, which gave him fans among the largest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who has actually been called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, he has been in contact with singer Arian Grande since 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting film with Miller's participation and the “Thank U Next”, in which she remembers him with love.
Miller is one of the music that death has been associated with opioid abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist of the 3 Doors Down group, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone was found in his body.
This article has been amended: the correct spelling of Walter’s name is “Stephen” rather than “Steven”.
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of fun with free application for Scratch 2 programming.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
Since then Basil has generated more than 30 games on mobile devices.
In today's game, there's a problem that works according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he grabs the netoper that gets out of the closet.
I learned to create a game on a fast course.
"Now I create them when I wake up," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote it on a five-day fast course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course organized by Codefest International was designed to provide children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
Son's father, Basil Okpara senior, says Basil played a lot on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet, because he always picked up his phone and played on it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in the creation of the game grew when he was 7 years old and received a full-time scholarship.
"One day he played on the tablet, as usual, and was so excited that I was bleeding," said the father.
I said, "You're still playing, can't you think of creating your own games so they can't play others?"
By saying those words, I was upset and I didn't think I'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in the science of creating his own games, encouraging parents to buy laptops and record them at a course where he has learned the basis of the game's creation.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his team titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in the Google game store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world, and, like Basil, this population has leadership in innovation on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were celebrated to use codes to create jobs sharing their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the middle school of women in Ghana won the 2019 Robofest competition for programming robots for stairwelling.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its satellites are on a good path to the code star career.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina admitted to a lie on corruption
Of the five documents submitted, it appears that the Presidents of the Republican Party in North Carolina admitted that he accused federal agents of investigating the corruption of the main political debtor.
According to Wokkendi Robin Hayes, he's going to be guilty in the future.
The document containing the actual basis prepared under the defence agreement and signed by lawyer Hayes found that Hayes knew that it was a false statement by FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement has been maintained, and on the basis of fact, it does not result in the approval of Hayes' claims.
Initially, he was accused of fraud, corruption, and the production of false reports.
The prosecutors accused the former Hayes Congress of participating in the plan of the insurance company's management of the campaign to the main country of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two colleagues were charged with trying to convince the Deputy Commissioner of Mike Causeya's insurance.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, one of the main political donors in recent years, who has transferred over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported primarily the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also transmitted documents to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to a fifth e-mail message asking for a comment.
Defender Hayesa Kerns Davis did not respond to a fifth email message asking for a comment.
Of the five documents submitted, Hayes found that he lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he did not talk to Causey about the employees of the State Insurance Department.
According to a document containing the actual basis of Hayes, he actually spoke to the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's request for a change in staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he spoke directly to the regulator.
According to the Quartet Act, Lindberg called for special treatment of its insurance activities and planned to transfer $2 million to the Causeya again in 2020.
The complainant also found that the request for a change from the department’s official who controlled Lindberg’s company was included in the complaint.
As a Republican Causey reported a series of attempts to corrupt federal agents and helped them collect evidence on the matter.
He wasn't set up for any charges.
According to the file of charges, Lindberg ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causeya campaign during the talks in which Lindberg and Causey were present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such money would attract attention, but as a result of the complaint, he finally stopped.
"As long as you want to do it all, we will do it," Hayes said, according to the file of charges.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The prosecutor of the federal prosecutor did not respond to an e-mail request for further information on the agreement.
Drivers take the first look at a new copy
Drivers from Saturday will be able to use from the first three built mountain views of the S7 express road, i.e. a new Zacopian – from the Beautiful White to the Red Source and the next two-way main highway to Chabówki.

Our goal is for your welfare.
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland," said Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice.
He came to Switzerland to vote in favour of Darius the Mathecian, candidate for the Seym from the List of Laws and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish version of the State of Welfare strategy," the Minister said.
"We want Poland to make a lot better use of their lives to be at the highest level.
This is necessary because in the contrary, young people, dynamics, well trained people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford to do so.
Our government for four years has consistently implemented a programme that has been committed to implement four years ago.
We said we'd introduce 500 plus.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said it's impossible that these money just doesn't exist.
We proved that the money was and were, only the PO didn't care about the ones they had to deal with."
Ziobro also mentioned the corrections for children and the thirty-third pension – and that the pension is also planned.
In addition to the 'distinct share of national income' priorities, the PiS is a just country and economic development.
Money should not only be dealt with with by a large stream of people who have a good relationship with institutions and authorities, but should be treated equally to society as a whole – the policy said.
Emmanuel Macron is the father of Jacques Chiracowi
French President Emmanuel Macron appeared on Thursday on the television scene of his predecessor Jacques Chiraca; he called him a great Frenchman and a big man.

And whether we shared his ideals, his battalion or not, we all met in this man.
This evening is a night of thanks to Jacques Chiraca.
He did so much for the people, for our values, brotherhood and tolerance," continued Macron.
He recalled that Chirac was opposed in 2003 to Iraq's war with Iraq, which did not have the mandate of the UN, to enter into a room in the Balkans, to stabilize and to restore peace in Lebanon.

Part of Sopocky Street in the Netherlands already after construction
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Sopock Street was dedicated to the operation in the Netherlands.
The total value of this task was 803 thousand gold, of which 26 thousand gold was funding from the FDS, and the remaining amount was the contribution of its own resources from the Netherlands and Gmin and the Netherlands.

Facebook with user self-sustainment will hide on a semi-smooth sample
In the first time in the world of the experiment, with the aim of improving user self-consciousness, some of the people who use Facebook will soon not see the number of photos, reactions, and videos under other conditions.
Popularity will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test on Instagram in July.
The new version of Facebook will also be launched in Australia on Friday.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook's privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a self-sensitivity study and the opinion of mental health experts indicating that the number of kisses can be compared to others.
"The response of many of the groups working with us to combat persecution as well as the mental health organization was really positive," Garlick said.
The elimination of this figure makes people group on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of kisses or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others via the platform will be more pleasant and will not be taken as a rival – she said.
Garlick has made sure that companies that support Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations that they have access to.
She said it was too early to be able to verify whether the test would be extended to other countries, such as the Instagram, when the test covered Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As in the case of Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment ends and whether the change will be made permanent.
"The user's initial comments on the new rules on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we continue to learn and listen to opinions," she said.
Speaking about the world's experiment site, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically well-known Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that it is an amazing country that provides us with measurable opinions that indicate whether the new experience is valuable to those who benefit from our services or not.
Common: The workers want what compensation they want for the supplements
The frequency at which they do not comment on the application of workers to the following metropolis of Wacław Depo for the transfer of financial compensation for the services of the waste economy in the nursery season.
The city's asking for 1 bad from the mirror.
On Friday, he spoke at a press conference with the leader of Wisny Robert Biedronia, who was organized on the leading side of the Light Mountain of the Commons of the Most Holy Mary Panny, the vice president of the city council and candidate to Seym Lukash Kot.
As he reported, on the day before, local SLD councils announced an appeal to Abbey Wacława Depo for the transfer of one gold city from each visiting Common Watch – to support the work of local, municipal services, etc.
We accepted an appeal to the Archbishop of Depo to help the city, to help us clean up after the raids, to search the city for the pilgrims.
"We ask for the budget of the symbolic gold city from each pillar.
This city will be able to provide them with better living conditions in the Commons," the Vice-President of the City Council said.
An application was made for a comment by the procurator of the case, Mr. Mariusz Bakalz, who initially prepared several responses, but then asked – as he suggested – to replace it with information on the content: “Until the official position of the city council is reached, we will not refer to the case”.
According to a project on the part of the Common Magistrate to Abbey Depo, "the provision of financial compensation for the Common City for the benefit of the municipal waste management system during the nursery season".
"In view of the increasing number of arrivals in the Common Bank and the growing costs of the municipal waste management system during the Pilgrim season, taking into account the vision of the city between its inhabitants and its inhabitants, its inhabitants, its peacocks and its peacocks, we wish, within the framework of the generally accepted cannons, to offer participation in the costs of the household service in the system," the appellant adds.
"To maintain, in the appropriate state, the purity of the railway tracks moving simultaneously with small infrastructure, i.e. external wastes, we present a proposal for a symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of 1 malt from the pipeline," it was written.
"In addition to participating in the annual costs that will cover the city’s own resources, with regard to the purity and aesthetics of the city, and also with a desire to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amounts will be allocated to improving tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available."
They noted that, on the basis of the financial issues, their proposals resulted in numerous reports by the residents of restrictions on the status of the path of purity that is moving by the rails.
"In view of the concern about the purity of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the City Council calls on the Archbishop of the Common Customs Tariff Depo to submit financial compensation to the City of Common for the benefit of the municipal waste management system during the watch season," the appeal was repeated.
According to information from the Press Office of the Light Mountains throughout the year, 834 thousand people participated in this sanctuary in the 200 general police stations.

Less than 20 people arrived at the Sanctuary of the horse, and more than 170 Pilgrims from two groups were on wheels.
"Inspectives" TVP has left the Confederation with a survey description
According to a poll carried out by Pollster, 45 per cent of the votes to the PIS were cast, 26 per cent KO, 14 per cent, PSL 7 per cent, and 5 per cent of the Confederacy.
It is even written on the “Super Express” portal for which the trial was carried out.
In the main edition of the “Visibility”, describing the same probe, the results of only four first parties were presented, completely covering the Confederation.
Commander Editta Lewandowska made it clear that only four committees were crossing the electoral line and would enter the Seym.
I see TVP also shows the share of the collective mandates without taking into account the votes delivered to the Confederation.
It would give the PiS independent government.
Krisztof Bosak, commenting on the whole situation, spoke of "public compromise on social integrity".
"They started with the Hasel of the 'Purity Revolution'," he recalled and claimed that this was a sign of weakness.
In addition, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that the “TVP visibility” in further actions against the confederation is offensive to Urban and Michnik.
He also drew attention to the lack of a legal journalist's response.
"But let us also look at those who call for mercy.
Those "right", "independable", "unsubstantiated".
In a few years, they have become a more primitive version of everything they fought at night," he added.

Brother sentenced to life's penalty for the murder of respectable social media stars Kandael Baloch
Kandeel Baloch, who became a star through a photo published in social services, was baptized in July 2016.
The Pakistani social media star brother Kandael Baloch was convicted on Friday of her murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most famous “honour killings” in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing ridiculous self-sacrifice – Greek according to Western standards, but in a strong mystical sense Pakistan was considered a proponent – was defeated in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseema was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that there was no summary of his actions and said that he “of course” murdered his sister and that her conduct was “unacceptable”.
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that the court in the western city of Multan recognized his client as guilty and sentenced him to life for a long time.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be brought to trial by the Supreme Court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar May, announced to the AFP that she hoped her son would be united.
"He's innocent.
It was my daughter, and it was my son," she said.
Baloch's murder took place on the grounds of world information services and repeated calls for action against the epidemic of honor killings in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women who were raped, tortured, tortured, tortured or tortured for such torture as choosing their own husband or, in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family "injurious" through the manifestation of their own sexuality.
Murders are usually carried out by close blood.
According to the Pakistani law of Qisas (blood money) and Dayat (old) they can ask for the nearest sacrifices for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted a new legislation imposing a life sentence on the victims of the murder.
However, whether the murder will be recognized as an honorary crime remains in the hands of the judge, which means that the killers can be theoretically relieved for other reasons and can be ruled out.
In the case of Baloch, her parents at first pressured their son not to show kindness in any case.
However, they are convinced that they can also lose him, change their mind, and prove that they want to do so.
The international threat caused by the murder has forced the Palestinian State to take the unprecedented step and to declare itself a loser along with their parents, requiring the same resolution of the matter to be put forward.
Baloch is one of the most famous achievements of Baloch is to offer a strip of pasturage before the Pakistani cricket team and to place a pure suction in Walentinki.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, viewed her as a dominant restriction in the country in which the invitation to become a model for Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The root causes of “honourary” murders are in tribal social standards that continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular, they regulate the behaviour of women, although men can also be victims.

Anarchia gives the number of displaced from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations organization reported that the growing violence has led to double the number of people living in northern and western Nigeria to some 40 thousand people.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency has stated that concerns have created “a new exceptional humanitarian situation”, which requires inter-agency efforts to meet up to the end of the year of new measures of $35.5 million.
Babar Baloch, spokesman of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group of Boko Haram, which has been ruling in the north of the country for decades, is not responsible for the last attack.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of organized armed groups.
"It's a scary picture of anarchy and insecurity," said the newspaper on Friday.
He reported on frequent reports of rapes, tortures, rapes, murders and sexual assaults on the ground by attackers, who also destroy homes and stolen property.
Military and police have been sent to combat the gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military has been withdrawn from the struggle with Boko Haram and the eviction of the Islamic state in West Africa, which has broken away from its former group in 2016.
"The arrivals do not come with the names of the groups," he said.
They're going to do it with the originals.
The arrivals are mostly moving to the neighboring Nigro.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that it is expected that more people will flee to Niger in the coming months together with the deteriorating security situation, particularly in the state of Sokoto.
New date of the trial of a man accused of killing women and 2 children
A new date of discussion was planned for a man charged with the murder of the state of Iowa and her two children from Guatemala.
According to the law of the District Court of Poland, 31-year-old Marvina Escobar-Orellan is accused of the first three murders, as claimed by the authorities, of a false name originally given by the police: Marvin Escivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit to guilt.
The police thought he killed 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter, and her 5-year-old son on July 16th in their house in Des Moines.
The Court of Justice has concluded that the new date for the discussion, i.e. 27 January, is the time for the representative of the two parties to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs officials claim that Escobar-Orellan lives illegally in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson, in the light of the bureau's rebellion to reduce the requirements for Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Within three weeks of the final visit of the EU leaders among the most important people in the country around the prime minister, they are afraid that they will not have enough time to get the most important concessions.
Boris Johnson is at risk of a rebellion on the part of the bureau that wishes to reduce requests for patents and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impassion on a new customs system, which should be replaced by a backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has defined proposals for other provisions offered by Johnson as "unprofessional".
Ministers of the Crown expect the EU's decision-makers, whose hopes are the President of Germany, Angela Merkel, to offer you a recently criticised leader to compromise as a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
Journalists The Sun spoke with three different branch ministers, all of whom are preparing to meet with the prime minister after the annual Toris conference next week in Manchester.
They will be welcomed by the prime minister of the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominica Cummings on the EU's attempt to use the buffer against the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement and then accept its offer made at the latest by the Union.
One of the ministers of the office identified a different judge of the Supreme Court, based on the conclusion of Parliament's suspension on Tuesday as "a warning signal", and added: "The only way to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of the agreement.
We're never going to make arthmetics in the Gmin Selection, which works for our disadvantage.
The Prime Minister must now take over and accept what he is able to get.
The aggression does not pay: it is obvious that Cummings' plan was burning on the floor.
We can't play battle on so many fronts.
The second branch minister committed himself to convey to Johnson to try to break the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresy May, unless everything else is said.
The minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to present again the agreement proposed by Theresa May at the Izbe Gmin."
There are a number of opportunities for her to make a statement, and everything depends very much on the end of this matter.
If we're forced to extend the term, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of us all.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not treating negotiations seriously.
In the opening talk, the first minister from the Turkish side said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we can't see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, it's moving with the villages in Scotland, checking the eggs in Wallia and knocking with its citizens on the main streets of the city – everything in the eyes of the world as if the campaign of election had already been held."
The speaker of the present prime minister admitted yesterday that the contract was still long and added: “No one should have any virtues: to ensure a very long agreement. ”
However, the speaker also said that the law of Benna, which introduces a three-month suspension of Brexit in the absence of the agreement, "actually weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes negotiations difficult for us, but despite its prime minister, along with its staff, is still trying to make progress through hard work."
The Secretary of Brexit Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more discussions with Michel Barnier on the EU's side.
They will discuss the book on how the area is functioning for Ireland as a whole for food and food.
A dog without his nose and feet under the Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
The customer was supposed to be successful.
But he managed to avoid it.
Suczka was transferred from Romania to Great Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with her animal since her first appearance.
"I initially found it difficult to convince my husband to adopt, because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided to take care of the cat until someone doesn't take it.
However, no one has reported yet.
"The fact that no one wanted her, made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was touched and needed love," said Kate.
At the end of the marriage, Bonnie decided to accept it.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie, in time, became a social media star.
On Instagram, over 14 thousand internally observed it.
Lorraine Kelly: It's said I'll never do a career on television with a music accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV executives said that due to the accent from Glasgow, "he will never do a career" as a president.
Recalling his 35-year-old career in the Kelli television industry, 59, she admitted that she felt “very upset ” before the first stage on the screen.
"I was just 25 years old and I was very upset," she said.
When I worked in BBC Scotland as a search and verification specialist, the chief said that I would never succeed in television through my accent from Glasgow.
I went to London to get to know the entire TV team and watch the program before I got an appointment at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget the story of the star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a successful TV correspondent in 1984, she started her career as a local journalist in East Kibride in Scotland.
Then she started running programs such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to start with her morning program "Lorraine", which was named after her name.
35. The anniversary of her career is a special programme that will include her best memories of moments and experiences.
The president said that the secretary of her long course on television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "frequency", adding: "You have to work hard.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interesting and interesting.
When she recalls the media references that caused her emotions, Kelly appears to have been "very difficult" for her to have a close relationship with Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or wounded children were watching our life program from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, who was murdered by Joanna's 5-year-old daughter, asked me for a private meeting during which we had been talking in her house for many hours.
The whole meeting was quiet, and Pam Ross and I will be friends from the funeral of Joanny, where I took part.
She added that "it's extremely difficult" was a report from Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeleine was destroyed in 2007 and that "they're really looking at their strength and attitude".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they also have the worst comments on Internet trollies.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The 35th anniversary program of Lorraine Kelly's work on television begins at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, 30 September at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of commitments
The senior state official claimed that Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga rejected the offer to take the office of President Robert Mugabe, a non-living President, at the turning point, because he was afraid of commitments to confirm the military's takeover in November 2017.
As presented last week by The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwende to take the presidency during his military negotiations.
However, in the social media, a higher level of government official announced that Chiwenga did not reject offers for fear, but because he looked at the Mugabe plan to use it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he actually lost during his return.
In response to the Twitter portal, which confirmed that 37-year-old Zimbabwe was seeking to transfer the authority of Vice-President Chiwand, not President Emmerson Manangawae, Jamanda 2, to which officials confirmed that he was the highest level of government official in the Bureau of the President and Council of Ministers, it was said that there was an intensive debate on this matter at the time.
The state officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys when he felt that the authorities were holding his hand.
The media between the military authorities and the dead former president had a view of a higher rank of state officials, three stages.
The official said that among the negotiating participants was President George Charamba, a former head of the Central Organization for Development Aaron Nheper and a spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The Chief of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was the next element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission of transmission of the bids to the President of Chiwandze, who was chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who, after his death, was considered to be more than an icon of Africa, tried to empty out on the U.S. military support, trying to force other African leaders to intervene.
The offer of the president, made by the deceased Chief Defence Force (SSO) of Chiwende, did not result from the election.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously early time, removing part of the dead family," wrote the official (Jamanda).
But there was also some political imprisonment, for which the dead wished to reverse the situation in a completely non-deplomat manner.
It is enough to remind itself that the witnesses have stated that they have not failed and do not disagree with the constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the U.S. position on conversions.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that the SSO (Chiwenga) would soon be released, severely interrupting the claims of the leaders that they had not failed to find a constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugab) was that the UA, which, on the other hand, continued to be highly focused on the whole situation and how to adapt it to its theoretical taxonomy of conversion, would have no alternative but to describe it as a turning point, therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
That's the spirit and the expression that made this offer.
The officials claimed that Mugabe had made this move when he felt that the defense forces had no longer proved ready to defend him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a ban list after warning of a power guard that he was risking a line in Kaddafi's style.
The military officers told him they won't return attacks on the citizens if they're moving to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires, namely to save his family and prove that the military took over," the officer added.
The temporary SSO and the witnesses read the premises correctly.
The message transmitted by the Ambassador (Gono) was given to an understanding – through a powerful metaphor – that the essence of the vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the Kumflas, that is, the army), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, said a higher level of state officials.
State officials say that the military has informed military commanders in the region through attacks that occurred in Zimbabwe that they do not intend to fight Mugabe but to deal with the surrounding “criminists”.
Mugabe has tried to use the same strategy to get Manangawa back from a short exile in the Republic of South Africa so that they can talk about the return and success.
In addition to the arms negotiations, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional strength, but also because of the fact that the current President Jacob Zuma was President Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the army comes to Mugabe's home as often as it has feared in the background, the army of South Africa will suddenly appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and the African leaders did not choose this route," said a certain informant.
China needs strong leadership or a "distortion" as stated in the policy document
China needs a strong, unfavourable leader of the Communist Party, since otherwise the country is "displaced" – the government has established a document on the fifth policy issued in the pre-70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
In the White Paper, the Chinese Press Office stated that the country's success since the adoption of the Communists 70 years ago is linked to the leadership of the party.
China is taking large areas, having complex national conditions, but it is rare to see the difficulties of administration.
The document recalls that without the united and strong leadership of China, they will move to the side of divisions and disintegration, which will be disastrous for the world.
In addressing the problems of the past, the Chinese authorities use hard hand policy, such as in the case of the interpretation of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, reasoning that it is necessary to maintain the country's stability.
The strong hand of President Xi Jinping, who will be at the end of the second anniversary of the world economy by the end of 2012, has further strengthened the government of the party and has imposed sanctions on those who may question the authority.
Xi also oversees the military modernisation programme, which has gone from the balance of the region.
The document stated that China did not attempt to export its development model or want to import any foreign models to the room only, not to the “hegemony”.
The Chinese do not have the genes of other nations or domination over the world.
In modern times, China has been plagued by great powers, and wars and disturbances have severely affected them because of the suffering they have suffered; China will never inflict other suffering that they have experienced.
China is dealing with this year at some time for a country that has been trained in the harsh war with the United States and which is facing challenges due to the release of the economy, as well as anti-government protests under China Hong Kong.
The document says that China never "transmitted" its most important interests or does not allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that "the danger of trade wars and further increase in customs tariffs will not lead to problems".
China has developed an economy with a full industrial system, a full industrial chain, a broad market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "wars will never weaken her."
China is sure to be able to cope with difficulties, change the crisis into new opportunities and open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should take a reasonable view of China's development, since China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States can't control China, and it's even less likely that they're maintaining China's development.
Limitation and weakening of other countries and the transmission of national differences beyond the borders will not ensure the United States of America's strong position.
World Jack Palkiwicza: Deep, real faces
The Dubai Emirat is a place that continues to seek its own identity, divided between Beijing tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extreme progress.
This branding new trends of world tourism leader is an imagery and ambition, facilitating the ease of affordable symbiotic hotels and attracting investors and traders to the status of tax haven.
The Internet sites are enthusiasts of this city of March, which is an exciting temple of luxury and the weighted architecture of the twenty-first century.
They came upon the rich in the valley of emeratism and became Eden for those who love the rest, the five-star hotels, the beautiful weather and the base of hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are attracted by all kinds of passions, the appreciation of creative hyperactivity and the hysterical track for adventure.
Here is a city whose motto is, "Shut up, tear down and heal."
And that's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the total darkness and opposition of the Metropolis has taken the size of the tantrum grotesque. ”
She was transformed into a future costume, completely inspired by the Book of Records of Guinness, an informal construction of the emir.
Because here everything has to be more comfortable and smoother than anywhere else in the world.
There is, however, a lack of transparency among the past and the austerity surplus, but it is important for the quality of life in ancient Europe.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like he's home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure not.
Running away from the world of time, I broke his golden mask, revealing other forms of artificial paradise.
Faces that don't speak aloud and don't write.
I'm showing the Asian Negro contrasting with the bassic conditions of the God-given ethnicity box of the Dubaijans, the grandchildren of the Beduins.
I'm staying in a place of extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the coast of the city, where, under harsh conditions, the army of Asian workers lives.
This is exactly what they built in one generation under the conditions of the wilderness of Manhattan.
They came here with good jobs and the opportunity to give their families a good life, and they stopped spending money.
This tourist will never see it because it could blow into the air created by the years of mit Dubai.
The frequent criticism of international society makes the issue of labour increasingly difficult for emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team ordered in her home a discussion of diets after her meals with food disturbances
Melanie Chisholm of Spice Girls admitted that there was a ban on the use of diet in her home, after she had herself coped with eating disorders, meals eating only fruit and vegetables.
Sports Spice has not been able to achieve and "excessively trained" the effects of pressure related to being a member of a celebrity worldwide pop group, which has led to later depression and nutrition disturbances.
She now reveals that her life is affected by the way she raises her daughter Scarlett, so she “does not let her house talk about diets. ”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I'm beginning to realize that she's more aware of her appearance," said Mel.
"I believe that one of the positives of the experience of nutrition disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak to her.
The use of positive language has now become my custom.
In a report for the Women's Health Mel magazine, which gained fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before the social media were created, comments on her topic were made on her.
"I began to look at myself inappropriately, turning aside from certain groups of food products, making it more and more serious, until I started to feel uncomfortable," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted for a few years."
Photo taken by the world
Polish girls and American documentaryists have given the world a witness to the violence of war.
Legendary photo of Julien Bryana can be seen in the Second World War Museum in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the walled city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America has to work, it has to help!", began his radio show documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In a tragic, September 1939, he was in the capital of Poland, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship turned out to be a wide corner in the West.
President Warszaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, hired a car, but then asked him to leave for his own safety immediately.
Brian wrote a letter to the family in the United States, posted it to the embassy chief, and... he left.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be where he was going.
400 planes and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan's been on pictures of death, suffering, the battle to survive in the city's castles.
Prior to capitalisation, he and his embassies were negative for the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He said to the world: “What has happened to Warsaw, the meeting of Paris, London, and even New York. ”
His exhilarating chronicle looked at President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
"My father showed the truth and thus fought against the German propaganda.
They made films glorifying their curiosity.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
Despite the fact that there was a number of violence against the sport, the fight against the threat of violence against the sport
Before the wave of vows, there is a process of violence carried out by a former college team in Delaware, which is subject to numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday, 10 days after the submission of the reports and the hearing of the arguments of the members of the Member State of the undertaking, the 23-year-old Clay Conawaya came to an end.
A woman who was 21 years old said Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the close of this two-year-old friendship on the side of the Bumble meeting and sent a woman through a man's photo on which he presented himself.
She is one of the six defendants of Conawaya on sexual abuse in the years 2013-2018.
It seems that the prosecutor’s appeal to which the woman agreed was in the form of an argument against her.
The defenders call for conflicting relations between women and women in the memory and claim that the woman is likely to grieve that she has reached a close relationship.
Gold on two rings: Polish router for millions of gold
Covered with gold rower worth millions of gold could be seen on a jubilee, 10th edition of the BIKE-EXPO International Rower Targets.
It's an unusual vehicle printed on the 3D printer.
His constructioner, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowic, just got his Rower Oskar at the World Customs Fair in Las Vegas.
- Rower covered is a gold nose chrome, under it is the highest silver sample.
It's an incredible funeral made by my colleague from Zor.
"There's a seat, there's a pedal, there's a driver, you could normally drive him.
It can develop speeds 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric wheel," says his designer.
"Rower's cart has been printed on 3D printer.
It's a six-year-old type of faith.
I fell into the idea of this model by going on my first tour home a few years ago.
I put him on the map and hid him deep into the ceiling.
Suck's been waiting for five years to come.
It's been three years," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the cart.
There are batteries, wires, elements that create construction.
It's hidden under a cart lined with 11 elements on a steel frame.
There's a train hidden there too.
The driver of this bike was set up a week before my departure to the United States at the World Rower Exhibition.
I couldn't finally decide what kind of manager this is.
She's in transport.
Rower weighs 90 kilograms," he assumes.
The gold-covered route has been awarded in Las Vegas the most important category of competition "The Best Unique Customs Model".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
The Sydney airport is surrounded by an opera building, the Circular Quay port, the Luna Park entertainment park, and of course the Harbour Bridge offers its important contribution to the amount of $22.9 billion each year in the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But under the bridge is a fraud of truth.
Sydney is one of the most affected waterways in the country, with an annual level of pollution of about 15 Olympic pools.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our coldest waters.
According to the new film material entitled “Sydney Park – up and down” the waters in the most popular city of Australia are full of wastes, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all this is due to sands along the rivers.
However, most of the sweetest part of our marine channels is plastic.
"I'd call it a paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, director of the study programme Sydney Harbour Research Program, published on September 27, with the publication of this film in focus during World Tourism Day.
The ocean looks beautiful, but it's one of the most modified and damaged rivers along our coast.
The CSIRO agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is delivered to our waterways, and most of it is affected by pollution through drilling.
"After such powerful attacks... it looks pretty tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from the deserts.
However, as in the case of a high ice problem with Sydney, it is much more serious under the water area, as 70% of the plastic that passes into the ocean is trajectory at the bottom of the sea.
"I believe that unless it's time under the water, you can't really know what's in the bottom," said Richard Nicholls, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his group are getting out of the water alone about 500 kg of plastic a year.
I think if more people knew (which is under water), they'd just be scared.
It's touching... more than half of what we find on that day is plastic nets.
The remaining 50% are things that are at least done from artificial creation.
When you look at the island, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that the whole plastic and the rest of the garbage we get right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and director of Ocean Protection, said there are ways in which people – both local and tourists – can help reduce the amount of plastic and the rest of our waterways.
"It has to start with the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, lead to material recovery, and have a greater awareness of what we put on the roads that eventually lead to the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, it's waiting for us because 50% of the dust we breathe comes from the ocean.
He's pulling 30% carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can arrange this liquid and bring it back to the old light, which is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we'll kill ourselves.
The film material financed by TOMRA in its extensive efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of consumers on alcohols that are often treated with the environment is carried out during a study on the dependence between artificial and mental health products that have been published this month.
A new survey of 546 children between 12 and 18 years of age found that 82% of respondents felt uncomfortable about waste from artificial products and 25% of adults with waste from single plastic packaging.
The study revealed that waste from artificial production was also a fourth concern of parents, and 93% of 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns were raised regarding the amount of plastic waste transferred to the oceans.
Many people who participated in the study said that they wanted to do something about wastes from artificial creation, but they just don't know how to introduce significant changes that led to ecological change.
Poland – Slovenia.

Google will create a drought in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The National Chmury Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has established a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation should help the Polish company to implement and use the potential of computer technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offers of National Chmurij Operator, and Google will open in Warsaw, so-called Google Cloud region – the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public computing circuit in Central Europe.
The numbering of Polish companies was one of the key institutions that were based on the project of the establishment of the National Bank of Poland, initiated and developed by the PKO Bank of Poland and the Polish Development Fund, the participants of the company.
National Chmry Partnership and Google is another important step along the way that we have taken a failed year ago by announcing the call of the National Chmry Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – the calculation of the Polish economy and the dynamimization of its growth.
"The Polish companies are now getting additional tools that have been developed to implement it.
By using them, they increase their chances of becoming a worldwide league, all of which depends on us.
The fact that Google will join their group today, which will significantly strengthen our joint project," says Zbigniew Jäjełó, president of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern businesses and businesses.
"Investment in the National Chemur Operator is ideally part of the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitalisation.
It will provide modern and affordable solutions based on chromium architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists," adds Paul Borys, president of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing the power to calculate and store data.
Customers in Poland can find all Google Cloud Platform key products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernets Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spencer or BigQuery.
Enabling Google Cloud services to offer the National Chmur will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that they use their global competition.
However, thanks to us, they remain in the Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," Michael Potoczek, president of the National Chmuri.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the need for the calculation required for the processing of obliquitous data collections.

It has already passed the sixth time through the centre of Warsaw to figure out how large and diverse society is becoming seniors.
By means of the Paradox, we are against harmful stereotypes regarding the elderly and we are referring to interracial solidarity."
The parade was conducted by a special painter who served as a musical mobile scene, where it was traditionally already heard by the Warsaw DJ Wika.
The participants in the joyous choir, at the second known Warsaw and world events, passed the Alejam Jerusalemski, ul. Cross to the Place of Upstairs Warsaw, ul. Mazowieck to the Place J. Piłsudski, and ul. Royal and Krakow to the University of Warsaw.
During the march, involving several thousand seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, the colourful Vietnamese delegations were asked by numerous groups on the road to the march, tours and tourists.
From the Legion, two organized groups were included in the company's green and blue shirts.
The first representative of the 3rd University of Germany and the Senior+ Club and the second under the name of SAGA, the Senior Active Group of Animators.
In the field of the university organizers, including the gastronomic and quantitative strands of institutions and companies offering services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreation, sports and fashions.
For example, for example, the Stylish Seniors of the Senior Voice by professional Hanny Piekarski and projector Agnieški Vyrwał, guidance and information on current trends can be obtained in 60+ mode.
In addition, Stoisko offered a scholarship for moving to the scene and inviting to the picture.
It's been reduced to show the fashion style of the Seniors.
At the end of the general voice of the Seniors, the latest edition of the letter and material on the campaign “Stop manipulation – Don’t buy on presentation!”
The next stations offered cosmetic, handmade, plastic and artistic vests.
A few studies could be conducted and consulted with specialists on health and nutrition.
Discussion panels were also organized with participation in: Heleny Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarski-Ferrenc, Tomasza Jacykova or Robert Janowski.
He didn't take any vocal and musical attractions on the picnic.
The legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, was presented on the scene, and tonight a inter-chooling dance took place, led by DJ Wika.
Tamanic deviles may provide guidance on the treatment of cancer
Tamanic deviles may have a key to the treatment of cancer – researchers who can revolutionize treatment for patients
Medical researchers have discovered ways to mask some new cell
Researchers have found that the same process comes from the demons of the Tasmanian people and the people.
There is hope that this will open up new methods of treatment for oncological patients.
What's the common tamman and people got?
Newborn cells that may become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have achieved a breakthrough in discovering that can help to revolutionize the treatment of some neurons if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of fatal gums across the face, threatening the future of a dangerous demon of Tasmania.
The study has established a way of masking some innovative cells both in humans and in tanks, using a white group called the PRC2, which excludes a marker that would otherwise give a signal to the immune system to attack the newborn.
This may be the biggest challenge in treating lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and skin cancer called cancer from Merkel’s cell.
"The importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immunological therapy, we may be able to reverse this process," said AAP senior researcher Mark Dawson from Peter Mac.
The existing therapy can be directed at re-injecting markers, a white MHC, which allows the immune system to detect new cells.
"Possibly, it has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
"This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her a lot better.
Researchers also hope that you will discover that you will ever be used to treat your tasman devil face cancer, where innovative cells in a similar way avoid detection.
"It's unusual that the same process is exactly the same (in the case of innovations in people and in the demons in Tasmania),” said Professor Dawson.
“How difficult this time was to treat the dogs of the Tasman devil.
But if the drugs that work in humans can also be used in the Taman devil, there is a possibility that it will help control the disease."
Scientists believe that there's a very large planet around the world.
Scientists are amazed by the discovery of a solar system that is 30 years light from Earth, which reflects our current understanding of the processes of the planet being created, since in this arrangement a large planet like the Jovis is orbiting around a small star called the red horse.
Artistic illustration of the planet of the gas type olbrüm GJ 3512b orbiting the central star of the red car, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets that surround them.
However, according to researchers in the fourth quarter, in this case stars and planets vary little in size.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 is about 12% of the Sun's size, instead of the mass of the planet that surrounds it, is at least half the mass of the Joviss, which is the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is absolutely surprising," said Astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales from the Catalan Institute for Space Research at the Spanish Institute for Space Research, which was based on research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of the creation of solar systems suggest that stars of a low mass from the rule become parent stars for smaller planets like Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a planet of a gas-like light-like kind like the Jovisa orbiting a very small star," added Morales.
The planet, like Jovisz, consists mainly of gas, discovered with the use of telescopes at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
She surrounds her star after a very elliptical orbit, and complete rotation takes 204 days.
Red carrots are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only significantly smaller than the Sun, but to a certain extent it is comparable to the size of a very large planet, since it is only about 35% higher than the Jovis.
They emit less energy, so they are lighter than the sun, and their surface temperature is lower and is approximately 3800 (steps) of Kelvin (680 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color," said Morales.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet that is currently orbiting around this star, while the third planet could be removed from a star system in the past, which could translate an elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jovisz," said Morales.
The planets form from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that forms the star around which the planets cross.
According to the leading model of the establishment of a planet called the model of action, the object is initially made up of particles in the disk and the force of gravity of the planet in the early stage of development allows for the formation of atmospheres from surrounding gas.
This unfair arrangement may explain the competitive model called the gravitational instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be something more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a loss of the stability of the disk and may result in some more severe areas.
These masses can grow until the moment of the fall and the creation of the planet.
Delicates staff responsible for the administration of co-workers of fasol dipu containing methamphetamine
The Office of the Seryfa in the town of Marion detained Cassandra Medina-Hernerdez, 38 years old, for the administration of co-operatives of fasol dipu containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, from Albania, 38th year, Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernardez was charged with the delivery of methamphetamine and the use of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes at the second level.
The complaint was filed on the basis of an event from 9 September in the food chain at the Griftway in Jefferson.
In a statement made by the OregonLive.com portal, which indicated the likelihood of wine on 27th anniversary, the suspected co-rapporteur told the deputy of Marion's host that during the lunch break, she saw how Medina-Hernerdez made a fasol dip that she then enjoyed.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of a crime, which according to what she related, never took methamphetamine, said that “she thought that one of her boyfriends had a strange taste, but it didn’t wake up in any suspicions. ”
When she got back to work, she felt that she had a stomach problem and that she couldn't stand her feet.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to the local hospital where it was found that the fascow dip could contain methamphetamine.
On the basis of the reports of The Smocking Gun, the next network worker on the Thriftway said that Medina-Hernerdez "sayed that he would add drugs to food", while another admitted that she was suspected of sending her message, claiming that methamphetamine had reached a fasculous drop by accident.
The OregonLive site informs about the recording from the monitor of the delicates, which is said to show how the body returned to the camera of Medina-Hernerdez extracts something from the biostonosis, is behind the mic and disappears.
Next, he cleans himself, cleans his nose, comes down to the table, and lays a fascist dip in a small paper fashion.
According to the police, the thing she had taken from the boston is also likely to be on the taller.
The Oregon Stateman-Journal newspaper reports that the offices of the Serifa claim that there is no doubt at present about the fact that customers are being given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in the prison of Marion's family – a fine of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun portal, her extensive police card indicates that the woman was already sentenced to assault, robbery, theft of identity, delivery of metafetamine, theft, possession of metafetamine and possession of unauthorized weapons.

What does KAS do about the head of the NIK?
We hire properties for the amount below the market price – the objections that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Mariana Banasia.
We asked what the treasure is doing in this regard in the Krakow Office and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report to "Supervisor" TVN, expressed doubts about the statement by the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Mariana Banasia.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau has been studying for a few months.
The control shall be completed in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
As a result of the announcement, Banasz had to rent a stone with a area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand gold a year.
The report "Superviser" revealed that the hotel was located in a truck rented by him for an hour.
The head of NIK later translated on state television, so he took over 5,000 gold coins a month for rent.
"Gaseta Wiborcza", calling on experts from the real estate assessment, said that it should be 15 thousand gold per month for the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded the previous contract and just because the buyer had to buy this stone, it made me agree to the fact that the remaining liabilities will be calculated on the sale of the stone," Banasz convinced.
However, doubts arose as to whether such proceedings were not a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, spokesman for the Free Trade Administration Elections in Krakow, told TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"All this kind of question, please direct the Minister of Finance," he added.
He explained that in such cases "the activities are carried out by the National Customs Administration".
The Free Minister of Finance Paul Jurek acknowledged that the National Administration of Customs itself monitors a number of matters that may arise in some way.
"The National Customs Administration acts in such a way that it has its own information as well as is based in a certain sense on those information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it shall decide whether or not any specific case is to be conducted or not," explained the MF.
"In view of the fact that it is binding on all of us in the entire financial resources of the treasure store, we will never be able to express ourselves in individual matters of a specific taxpayer, a specific person, or a company," he stressed, asked about Mariana Banasia.
Finance Minister Jerzy Quicinski stressed that "the customs authorities do not transmit this type of information to the public."
"Of course, the entire treasure industry is dealing with very many similar cases throughout the country," he said.
Secrets of the Royal Family: Toursing guests often fly by royal plane
Under the service obligations of the royal family during their lifetime, they must travel hundreds of miles all over the world.
This usually makes it easier for a royal plane – a private machine that carries the royal family around the world on important events and events.
It is not surprising that owning a plane is linked to privileges.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand on long roads to rehabilitate, they do not apply for the number of baggage, and they can also, as it turns out, ask for any guests – including those who are really unsatisfied.
According to the recent Prime Minister on Channel 5 of the documentary film not only the king and the book Philip often travel by royal plane.
During the program entitled "Kingly Flights Secrets" the king's pilots have revealed that with the royal family, the Latin-litered guests are often with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes, along with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly. ”
It is not surprising that the queen could borrow herself to accompany her loved ones on her journeys, since she is known for her deep attachment to dogs of the race of the raven.
Since the early years of King Elizabeth has been a lover of these curious creatures and has been hearing that since the time of the crown, she has been the owner of more than 30 crowns.
It is said that in 2007, she had five strokes: Monty, Emma, Linneta, Willow and Holly.
It joined them with five cookers: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, as well as four dogs that are the cross-section of the cider: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal plane's crew must have had full hands.
A staff member of the royal psychiatry's house was seen to meet their needs before they were stopped at the airport – says Sheelds.
I'm glad to say it never happened.
The programme also revealed a growing number of baggage that the king took with him during the journey in carrying out his duties.
The film Narrator stated: “In 1953 the king took a bag of 12 tons of luggage on his journey of 70,000 kilometres."
To be able to visualize it better, it's less than two huge salts.
The king, however, is not the only person with weakness in fashion.
Similarly, Queen Cambridge has its own image of the transport of her garden – it is said that each of her cousins has a personal seat.
The new law comes into force.
Victims in cases receive pensions
On Friday, the regulation shall enter into force which shall ensure that in cases of serious damage, the next interest payment is paid – shall inform the Financial Officer.
It shall apply from 9 July 2019 on the specific rights of persons affected in the event of the loss of a guarantee amount established on the basis of the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At the same time, they had to decide less than the current guarantee amounts, and in some cases insurance companies had already stopped the interest payments.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been engaged for many years in establishing a mechanism that will allow for serious damage to the financial support in cases of the assurance of the communication OC or the OC of the farmer in spite of the loss of the guarantee amount," says Alexander Daszewski, a legal adviser to the Finance Office.
The Court of Auditors considered this necessary because these are often very tragic situations involving people in very poor health who cannot, for example, work on the case and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them have not already received corrections and increased needs in view of the need for further treatment or rehabilitation in view of the loss of such a guarantee sum for the OC police.
Some of this has been dangerous in recent years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability of the insurer was significantly lower than the present one.
Therefore, the problem of evasion of the guarantee amount in the previous years was most often affected by those who suffered injury in the 1990s.
The guarantee amounts were very low at the time, and economic conditions caused significant price increases.
"We also noted that this problem also affected a number of young people who suffered damage during the period when the amount was EUR 350 thousand per accident.
It is currently EUR 5.21 million for an event, regardless of the number of injured.
So this is a huge difference with regard to earlier periods, from which the problem required legislative intervention," recalls Aleksander Daszewski.
In view of the fact that the guarantee amount is sometimes increased, the legislator has agreed that the upper limit of the liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time of granting to the Retirement Fund.
This principle shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay interest on the basis of a decision by a court setting a maximum guarantee amount other than that set out in the EC insurance agreement.
This is in the case of an increase in the amount of guarantee on the basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which makes it possible to modify the existing obligation relationship.
"In recent days we have sent letters to people who have come back to us with an intervention request.
We inform them of new privileges and of course provide further support in the event of any problems," says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini was punished for cutting a boy's penis
The report concerns the events of November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, it was then Brenda Barattini who found out that her boyfriend showed her a friend of sex who was in their bedroom.
28-year-old, who is an architect, explained before the court that a partner in this way ruined her life and treated her with no "trophym" that could be praised in front of friends.
“He has damaged my privacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
The residents of Cordoby decided to judge justice themselves.
She invited her boy, 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him she was preparing a special surprise.
With the help of an asthmatic note, she slammed his eyes after him and pulled his penis out of his ass.
"I felt like I should die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pull down and pull over the cell phone to get ready," said the wounded.
"I wanted to go out, but she started treating me.
She chased me for hair and hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had offended her by revealing sex, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said in the vows.
She was finally recognized as guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
A former state congressman of Alabama, Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, he died a member of the State Congress of Alabama from the side of the Republican Party of Jack Edwards, who served for 10 years and belonged to the first republican branch of the so-called Southern Hemisphere.
The family spokesman said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting the new trade.
Edwards was first elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from the state of Alabama in the South, thanks to the party's achievements.
At Congress, he earned 10 nominations.
According to a family statement in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave for its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to come back.
"I hope that my lawyers and lawyers will grow up in a country where the common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems will be answered," Edwards said in a family statement.
The State Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said Edwards served his position and his country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that the flag on his part in the capital of the state of Alabama will be released to half the mass.
"He was the person of a real state official and was the best man for Alabama.
Our state lost one of the most prominent policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama called Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed great appreciation for Meghan Markle for the Instagram on Thursday, calling Prince Sussex “a powerful leader who transcends the schemes and thanks to which our world is getting better. ”
The priest and priest Harry, who now took the ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Archipelago Mountbutten-Windsor, attended a meeting with the young man at the beginning of the week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obam Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal City, Prince Sussex @susexroyal, "a smart leader who transcends the schemes and by which our world gets better," she wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic song.
"Is this meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation @ObamaFundation, or helping girls around the world gain access to the education they deserve, is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, placing a picture of the funny Meghan with the foundation leaders.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the British Vogue, a guest edited by former actor of the "Suits" series.
In fact, she was the first lady to talk about parenting and how she changed.
"Be a mother means bringing to the mystery of the art of forgiveness," said Obama.
“Material has taught me that, for the most part, my task is to give children space so that they can know the world and become the ones they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be in their age, but who are inside the heart.
Both of them, who knew from experience what the pressure of being on the church, shared with the royal council during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
She said, "The pressure that you feel – hurt by yourself and others – may sometimes push you."
"So my advice is to relax and not rush into anything.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent most of my time caring for my daughters, making sure that they had good advice at school and made new friends before I dedicated myself to a more ambitious career.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa maintains a license to sell alcohol in spite of complaints against the owner
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Commission for the Control of Alcohols in Washington has sent a proposal to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose access to the sale of alcohol in view of the ownership of the owner.
The Agency has managed in the middle that the burden of three shepherds, two embezzled judges and two rabbis is safe because most of them do not live in the district or have no property.
The Washington Post states that the reason you are trying to refuse the hotel's license for sale of alcohol is that it is in force in the distribution of the law that the applicant for the sale of alcohol must prove to be a "good skill".
In the initial complaint filed last year, it was claimed that President Donald Trump was wrong, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were raised.
The charge was removed because the permit was granted before it was submitted.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the permit.
“The Sun”: The overwhelming report recognises the scandal of police services in Cleveland for the worst in Britain
The inspectors considered the SCOMROMIATION OF THE SCANDALALAM police to be the worst in the United Kingdom.
The interim report assessed the work of the police in Cleveland as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, chief police inspector of His Royal City, claims that there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in the Cleveland police services.
New appeals were made to resolve police services, with five commanders in six years.
According to the report, the police have not taken steps to prevent crime, arrest of suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley, chief police inspector of His Royal City, said: "There has been a significant deterioration of standards since our last inspection."
Commander Mike Veale gave up in January after a year's failure in the form of an investigation into the "reverent", although unknown, the charges for his actions.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was detained after arrest under the arrest warrant.
In the past year, Inspector Simon Hurwood took the lead in the Commission's efforts to equip staff for sexual activity.
He left the service.
“ It is official confirmation that these services are compromised, ” said Burmese Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the Towers.
It's time to include the Department of Home Office now."
Police commander Richard Lewis said: "I will take full responsibility for the police force through changes in their performance."
We've got a visualization of the ski park!
Are young people really waiting for you?
Older residents are interrupting the rides of young people on wheelchairs and wheelchairs, and you are also complaining that there is no suitable place for them in Olava.
Young people from years remember the place to ride on wheels, skis, wheelchairs, bikes.
The issue is still going back to our feet.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time, there was a complaint about the lack of a ski park.
That's why we're going back to that again and ask in the office what's going on?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who was interrupting a young man running in the center.
"I write on behalf of the people of the block in Piłsudski, for example, so that you can take an interest in the situation of the Olaw youth," writes Malgorzat.
“The residents of the block called the City Guard many times ineffective.
On the basis of these daily situations, I send a photo."
We asked others about this.
Most simply claim that young people just don't have a place to ride in the city, and for years they've been trying to find a place for themselves.
Under the post on Facebook, there was a string of comments.
We've already written in July that there's a chance for a ski park to be built on the Oval City.
The mayor reported that the city had been funded by a ski park building.
"The project consulted with the young is ready with permission.
On 28 March, a proposal was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism to finance the work of the "Building Skatepark in Oławi" under the Sport Poland programme.
Total project value: 798 306.00 zł.
Amount of funding requested: 263 440,00 zł.
Now we've asked again what stage the matter is.
"We still have no information on the relationship to discuss what the Ministry of Sport and Tourism has to ask for funding," said Elżbieta Bednarczyk, director of the European MU Oława Fund.
"The information received from the staff of the Ministry shows that the final selection of all tasks under the Sports Programme of Poland should take place in October".
We also asked for a visualization of the Oval ski park.
We present her below.
The youth reported that on Saturday (September 28th), they will collect signatures on the request for a ski park building in Oław.
"The growing youth saw the last post on Facebook and agreed to organize the collection," wrote Mikolaj.
The signatures under request will be collected from 12.00 in the vicinity of Lidl.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: rescue 1/16 final.
We know a couple, hit a year ago.
It was one of the most secure rivals in the extraclass.
The greatest legend has been the memorial match since 1996/1997.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took up an old stadium at the Lásienkow railway station in the former railway station.
Both groups share the point.
The economy had to win, the second of the series of mysteries of Poland gave a point.
At 87 minutes Legia drove 2:0, but within five minutes it reached the ground – Vidzew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Lódzki club with a run-up of years has fallen more and more tarapaths to stop counting in the battle of mystery and fall from the highest level of entertainment.
The last two groups met at this level in 2013/2014.
The legend – along the way to the title – brought two victories – 5:1 in itself and 1:0 in the exit.
Back to the Elite
Now the ship is fighting back to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least a year, since in previous games, one of the factories was unable to advance on the extraclasses.
As a result of this year's failure, he was in the club for the framework revolution.
The authorities have changed, finally placed on trainer Marcina Kaczmarka, and in making a further step up the club hierarchy, they are helping in the legal battles of Marcin Robak and Mateusz Móžžžüdz.
The fourth is in Table II, but in Pucharze Polski he won on Tuesday the extraclasses of Wrocław 2:0.
The legend of the same size was hidden on the exit of the island of the Netherlands.

Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "surrendered" and the investigation under the impeachment must be addressed to his tower
We'll never know where we're going.
Now I think we will be involved in trying to hide the facts of an attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation can be confirmed," said Pelos in a report to the CNN at the Summit.
"They perform the work they have started, keeping the facts and time necessary to find them," she added.
According to a protocol issued this week by the White House, Trump asked the President of Ukraine to conduct an investigation on former Vice-President Joe Biden, candidate for 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zełenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giulian, as a result of the protocol.
Trump refused to do anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN announced that national security lawmakers from the Department of Justice had notified the complainant of the proceedings of the Troupa with Ukraine's participation more than one week before the formal notification.
Following a complaint by intelligence officials from the Community, the Department of Justice concluded that the telephone interview did not provide a criminal investigation on the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should report, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee decides who is to be called a witness.
She added, however, that Barr thought he was out of favor.
It's been such a long time.
"On the contrary (Barra) will change in all of this," added Pelosi, referring to the change of Trupa to his general prosecutor during the July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
It's interesting that he made decisions on how to handle complaints.
Pelosi stated that "very scared" about the signalist informers that Tromp attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past, they had been dealt with by spies.
I think the President's words go beyond responsibility, that's dangerous.
Our signallers play an important role in discovering – the sending of developments in our government," said Pelosi, adding “The President’s words on persons who can provide information are seriously considered to be honest in management.”
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step in declaring a formal investigation to fill out an act contrary to the law on the basis of an attempt to impose pressure on the leader of the state in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in a complaint published in Thursday, in which the signalist claimed that Trump had forced his authority to "save Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signalist also suggested that the White House lawyers had instructed officials to remove the record of the computer system in which they were maintained for the needs of officials of the Council of Ministers and to place it in a system designed for information in particular sensitive terms.

Possible prohibition of driving too fast for the Crystal Palace Christian Benteke club attacker
The Premier League Christian Bentek, who has been arrested twice over for the last two months, is threatening the ban on driving.
Crystal Palace, 28-year-old, agreed to drive Bentley's car at 80 miles per hour on land with a limit of 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond, south-west London on January 20th.
Then, in March of Putney's photo gallery in south-west London, Belgium registered a speed of 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentette from Kingston Hill from Surrey has no need to stand in the Room Court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He acknowledged the two steps at the beginning of July under the simplified procedure on which the crimes were more considered at the meeting held by one judge.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned with the structure of the Audit Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and the representative of the Second Hasakas Club, expressed doubts about the composition of the Audit Commission for the needs of the upcoming elections to the National Football Association in Ghana (GFA).
He challenged the inclusion of the Commission President, Frank Davis, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
The GNA Sport Manu report questioned whether the Commission's President would be honest because the results of the verification process are in his interest.
The Audit Commission should consist of neutral outsiders who do not communicate with any of the members and who have previously shown no interest.
For example, Davies employed the NC as a lawyer, who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for 10 per cent of the payment.
He's also a well-known solver of the Olympics.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Audit Commission because he is interested in it," he said.
He said that if Fred Papoe, the Director of the Olympics, is present before the Commission, the President's interests will be challenged on account of his association with the club, suggesting at the same time that if he is represented by Palmer before the Commission, he will be the subject of prejudice and impartiality.
According to the expectations of the Commission members, they had to start work from yesterday, following a ceremony in the GFA Secretariat in Akre on Tuesday, 19 September, and ending on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and its members are the members of the Consultant of the corporate government and the lawyer, Mr Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
For the rest of the members, Reginald Larryea, the Director of Market and Business and Richard Akpokavia, the sports administrator and the lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the governance of equality
The two main parties of Israel, the shadow of the Black and White and the Lukud, continued on Friday negotiations on the call for a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the presidential commission of formed the Government of Benin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The discussions considered the possibility of the rotational leadership of both parties in governance and the stay of Netanyahu at the position of the Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli newspaper Haarec says, there was no approach.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Council of the Black and White has announced in the communication that it has submitted its initial recommendations.
Likud's right-wing charge is that "he's been busy in his positions", hoping that his leader and current prime minister, Netanyahu, will remain in power, and in the office, he's first in his ultraorthodox policy.
"From the very beginning, it has been known that the Montenegro-Biali do not comply with these conditions", a communication published by them.
Otherwise, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, he wants to ‘ lead Israel into the second round of elections’.
Leader of the Black and White Benny Gantz rejected the support of the government that would guide Netanyahu, as long as he was charged with participation in three corrupt cases, on which the prosecutor could formally accuse him of being appointed in the middle of the meeting.
"Likud and Niebeko-Bila received enough majority in the 17 September elections, which would allow them to join the common governments as natural partners, but would push them into negotiations that none of the parties wanted," says the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin tried to bring their positions closer in the last days and proposed a call for "the rotational government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspended his functions, which would allow Gantz to hold this position if the charges against Netanyah were maintained and formulated.
There's no need for Israeli analysts who think things got out in the dark.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of a survey published on public television on Friday, wish to block the political situation in the country by calling the government of unity under the rotational leadership to change Netanyah and Gantz.
That is how 50.6 per cent of Israel's people, 32.1 per cent of the people concerned, are opposed to such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israel's society - on the question of who should first stand at the office, 41.8 per cent of respondents are told about Netanyah, and 40 per cent about Gantz.
In another survey published by the newspaper Israel Hayom, the percentage of government voters rose to 63 per cent, and 60% were against the new election, which would be the third year.
In the previous parliamentary elections on 17 September, Sojus Gantza won 33 mandates in the 120-local Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 mandates.
Netanyah with its traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 posts, while Gantz – 54.
None of the parties have received 61 mandates necessary to achieve a majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final game with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check out", when Wallia is in the final play with Australia under the World Cup, which can create their woods in the tournament.
The victory of Walli over the "kanuguras" would set this team on the position of a certain factory to win Group D and ensure that they participate in a possible virtual meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Walli once 14 times during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent to an old with England in one eight final.
"Let's make the case clear, the two teams want to try to get through and find themselves at the end of the group," said the Walloon War of Tipuric.
In the past, there have been some difficult results, but it was nice to be with them (Australia) in the past.
I think they're gonna try hard to get us this victory, and we're gonna have to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it'd be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check.
Valia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand, or RPA in the history of the World Cup – and it was 32 years ago in the third place when she finished the "kangari".
And their overall record under the direction of the main trainer Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to carry out three teams of heavy weights from the southern half.
Valia has been one of the 30 lost tested matches from Australia in November last year, and Tipuric has prepared to be among the few of the 9-6 winners who run for the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric, who was asked if the team had experienced mental disorders before this victory, added: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so balanced that maybe... people expect some mental blockade to occur, I don't know.
At the end of the last game, we probably left about 15 points on the box, so the final result seems to be much smaller than it actually was.
If Valia gets upset, while fighting Tipurica with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the line of Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be of major importance during the arrest and release.
Tipuric attended 67 representations and met with both professionals on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he is waiting for.
"These are the players who play the seventh world class in absolute terms," he said.
When playing against the world class of third line players, it's always known that it's going to be a tough game to play.
These two are always with the best employees in the world.
You know what kind of game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is more attacking the seventh and probably feels better, because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the world's best players and face challenges than to deal with a third line of noise that's not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and getting rid of these two, you must be in a decent shape.
I wouldn't say on Sunday it's almost over, but it's an important game for us in this world.
Impet is an important element.
When we are strong and constantly exerting ourselves, we will be as hard as a runner and will be able to win.

Premier of books.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlünarczyk
They were supposed to be the elite organization of the Lords.
They have accepted in their ranks those who waited.
Can crime be combined stronger than national identity?
In your country, we give you no further book on the subject of war or military.
We offer a deep international study on non-German participation in Waffen-SS.
Historians from various European countries are studying the positions and motivations of the volunteers, reminding them of their activities and looking at the recruitment processes at the various stages of the war.
Did the Danish division differ from the French?
Where'd he go with Ukrainian enthusiasm?
Why was it not possible to create a section made up of Poland itself?
How does the official historical narrative look today about collaboration in individual European countries?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other things, the book Waffen-SS is based on solid research material.
We have been able to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer picture of cooperation in Europe during the second world war, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of history and the period of action by presenting the authorship reports from different countries. (...) Whether the main victims of this war - tax workers, Jews, Greeks, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slovak people - are sometimes represented in a comparative and/or international opinion, they are mainly from the national perspective (if they do).
‘Total panic’ when the White House disputes with the finding of arguments on investment
The White House officials are ashamed to see how to break free again on Thursday, and one of the speakers mentioned in the situation describes the feeling of “a total panic” felt last week because of the lack of a new reality response plan.
It seems to be “severe, insecurity and fear” – one of the people associated with the White House describes in this way a situation in the West – that the taxes of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people around him.
The person said: “There is no great confidence that nothing is hidden there. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in this situation, but also because the sanctions are so serious that the standard methods of effective countermeasures used by the president in the past may not work. "It does not look like something that goes on with the next cycle of news".
Another person with experience in the discussion described the atmosphere prevailing in the White House as “the state of shock” which accompanied the growing uncertainty that, along with the ongoing investigation of the investment, the likelihood of the president’s reply would be irresponsibility and would become “hard to learn. ”
This statement is shared by another speaker who claims that the people around the president expect him to be more “sustainable” behaviour and that the pressure on him will undoubtedly start to grow with each day of the investigation on investment.
This raises concerns that Trump may present more and more unforeseeable behaviour and unexpected way of shooting – this is a concern in the context of the election year, both from the point of view of both the presidential and the elections.
By putting the greatest threat to the presidency, Trump was running from the attack to the defense, once again following a strategy that was evaluated as effective during Robert Mueller's investigation on Russia.
He tried to restore his own request to the Ukrainian President for assistance in investigating his political rivals, to pay attention to the actions of the Democrats and the candidate of the Democrats Joo Biden, and to educate the informer as a leading party initiative.
But while many people in the White House were engaged in war after Mueller's investigation, this time something changed – the consultants and consultants said.
The president, whose identifying mark is the force, showed the environmental press conference as a winner – said one of the persons identified with the situation.
While Trump was actively responding to the Russian investigation questions, it seemed that he did not want to answer the questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the chairpersons believe that it is possible to avoid damage, and some of them maintain that the informant did not have knowledge of the above-mentioned controversial telephone conversation between President Trupe and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zełenski – according to them, his credibility.
As is often the case when the president is the object of an attack, this fact is alive under his chief advocates in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies related to the White House shows that the results of the president's support polls are skyrocketing, and the impeachment will not have a great impact on the acquisition of new sympathies.
"There is no position in the need to concentrate on the appointment of the President in the next four months", particularly if it is difficult to implement its legislative programme and is in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker claims that those who held that the impeachment would help the president did not finally understand how his reaction would be unpredictable.
The concerned White House officials sought help from advisers, completing an impeachment response team.
According to the person I know about the plans, given that these efforts are in an early stage, there is no clear indication whether any initiative in the centre of evidence will be taken and what form it can take.
The person stated that he was convinced that the legal and communication strategy needed to be coordinated with the decisive leader to be able to launch an attack on PR in response to the publication of a sensitive signalist report and aimed at stopping the spread of democratic actions concerning the investment undertaken by the disclosure of this report.
The speaker noted that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clear when the Secretary of State of Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Charlemagne Steve Mnuchin indicated that they did not intend to disclose the notes describing the Trupa talks with the Ukrainian President, and 48 hours later it could have felt that there was no exit and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the press will now be more than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who has been very silent and spoke only on charges. One person who can be involved in preparing an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trupa's dirty job and former president of the electoral board – has shown the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not a true suggestion that he would lead this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and his programme – he said – but I did not take part in any talks with the President or his team on joining the group in order to remove a false statement about the investment."
A private lawyer, Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in investment activities.
"We react to the issues as appropriate" – Sekulow replied when he was asked by NBC News for a comment.
The White House now feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the area of impeachment, such as Emmet Floyd, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, went away, and the current adviser, Pat Cipolone, has no such experience.
The White House Strategy speaker stated that the general officials had never planned to hire people or create a centre of evidence, but admitted that there was a need for coordinated, joint response and people who could lead a political battle.
Traveller of the Seas line Royal Caribbean has gone through the repair of 89 million pounds
Explorer of the Seas, a member of the Royal Caribbean International family, will release this year on the journey, presenting a completely new look.
After a renewal of $110 million (89 million), the ship is invited to a wide selection of culinary beads from around the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the entire family.
This year, the Explorer stops at the most Spanish ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the arrival on land is almost over, the ship's crew promises the unforgettable effects on the sea.
By offering a satisfactory offer to each, the Explorer, after refurbishing $110 million, or about $89 million, was transferred to a passenger ship providing a perfect break for the entire family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on the surface through advanced surfing simulators or watch favorite family film using the weather patterns in full-time cinemas.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies that enable the passenger of the cabin to view views on the ocean without the need for exits on board.
Water lovers will enjoy the design of a new floor with a connecting style of the Caribbean cuisine with the gardens of the water park.
The pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and ideal beds to relax in the sun, and two modernized are completely up-to-date in the hands of people with strong impressions on the surface.
An attractive traveler for passengers every year imposes the number of activities available to guests during the trip to destinations.
The idea of small Adventure Ocean for children is a chance for younger members of the family to enjoy beautiful memories, and the exclusive place to spend free time for adults provides a super game and music area prepared with people over 12 years of age.
If this appears insufficient, the whole family may be measured in the ‘B study’ on the ship in the laser tag with the effect of lighting in the darkness, which can also be used as a boat ride on the bed.
During the journey through the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to get to know exotic tastes from around the world, hanging on the side of the restaurants located on the beach.
The modern Asian cuisine is offered on board at the Izuma restaurant, and in the freshly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is served with an inspired novelty view of the traditional Italian cuisine.
The other food items on the table are served by the American restaurant offering Chops Grille, the Latin bar Boleros, the Schooner Bar and the express bar Johnny Rockets.
Reyes, with a seven- or nine-day route option, is due from Rome in May 2020.
As a second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, it is connected to Allure of the Seas, which has recently passed an incredible repair.
After 58-day allure metamorphosis, at a cost of 165 million dollars, the travel operator offered guests who had previously made a reservation, a $300 bill to be issued on board the ship.
The tour operator said: "Explorer of the Seas is a fourth vessel of the Voyager class that will undergo transformation in the modernization of the Royal Amplified fleet."
The programme, which requires investment of more than $1 billion, including 10 ships and for four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of opportunities: from irrevocable attractions and night-time gastronomics.
Devin Nunes accused Democrats of trying to "take a picture of the Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes from California can't clearly deny the fact that the investigation is about President Donald Trumpa.
In his fourth defense, the president accused the Democrats of wanting to get a good picture of the president.
Now, a high-ranking Republican sitting in the Commission of the Election of Representatives, has put a high pressure on the statement in advance during the hearing of the complainant's complaints, such as that Trump returned to Ukraine to assist in the investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotic representation" of the left and their "medial axis", before he claimed that the Democrats wanted to see a picture of the president in the Neglis.
"Democrats in this very commission have negotiated with people who, according to them, have been Ukrainians to get a nice picture of the Trompa," said Nunes.
"People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to be the president in charge when they have their chance over the year.
When Nunes finished rehearsing, the political reporter of HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to find out...
To this time, only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, replied, although we suspect that his answer is the truth, confirming the idea of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
Portal Mediaite.com suspects that Nunesa's comments on the burden referred to “some more interesting and unconfirmed information”, which are likely to appear in the controversial acts of Steele,
It is celebrated by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of hostages against Trump, pointing to the probability of the existence of a tama, which shows him at night looking at the power of prostitutes in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential studies on biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Sami Tesli have reduced information services in recent years, one issue appears to be calling for renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at Albert University developed a technology that could use renewable biofuels as fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University at the Department of Agriculture, Science and the Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory produces carbon fuel obtained from fat wastes such as restaurant fats, animal fats and vegetable oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can benefit from low-quality oil as a result of an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, as well as the use of waste from other industries.
This technology has the task of imitating current hydrocarbons in oil fuels.
“What our technology did in the first generation – said Bressler – is [in the creation of] hydrocarbons that are identical particles like diesel fuel.”
While opening up this new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuel products had a tendency to destabilise at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat to high-quality aircraft.
"The problem with the fuel aircraft is a little wrong," Bressler said.
It's really worth less than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aircraft.
The first option is a low-risk approach, which requires additional treatment of carbon dioxide and water supply.
The second option is to continue work on partly developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit," Bressler said, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
The opening company, created by the University of Alberty, Forge Hydrocarbons, works on product marketing because the airlines, as well as the Canadian and American army, are increasing investments in the new option.
"They are able to show themselves the time when the situation can be reversed and the carbon tax imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot plant near the Waste Management Centre in Edmonton and has recently received a total of $4 million from Lockheed Martin for investment in support of a $25 million construction facility that will be located in Sombra in Ontario.
It is expected that the plant will produce about 19 million litres of biofuels annually.
Bressler also notes that the proposed carbon reduction is about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further carbon reduction.
"As a technology specialist, Bressler said,
I have the task of developing options that allow informed decisions and many choices."
HISTORY: ADDICTED FOR BUSINESS
8 thousand euros and 750 euros lost the place, thinking it's helping his grandson who caused the accident.
The incident police reported on the fourth son of the suspect.
"The woman was called in the middle of a man who gave himself to her grandson.
He said he'd caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
The senior wanted to help the grandson deliver 8 thousand dollars and 750 euros to a false police officer who came to her house," reported Dr. Dorota Krakowska-Bubillo from the foreign police.
Police are looking for judges and then calling for caution:
‘Every phone with a request for financial assistance shall be verified.
You should not act under the influence of emotion and hastily.
Remember, the police don't ask for money and they don't take the money.
If we receive a phone with a request for financial support that stimulates our suspicions, we should respond immediately and inform the police by calling the alarm number 112.
We also appeal to younger members of the family.
Let's talk to our seniors about the dangers, let's tell them how they act.
Please be careful and don't trust people who call and ask for a reward."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson warns that if the British brexit turns back, they're threatening to be in Los Angeles, and he's calling for peace.
One of the main ministers of the office said yesterday evening that the country was threatened by "a violent social scene", if the first result was questioned by the results of the second referendum.
The UK Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, from his closest surroundings, warned that the country is threatened by social unrest on the scale of the protests of the "red camel" in France because of social inequalities and the housing situation in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for the "strengthening of tools" during a turbulent political debate, but stressed that it would not stop using the word "suspending".
Despite his appeal for peace, the branch minister said “The Times”: “There has never been protests in this country such as the demonstrations of gilet jenies” or the 1992 Los Angeles residence.
People think it's impossible just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – young gilets – they use encrypted phones that can coordinate pickets, and there are enough unsolicited populist leaders to get people to protest.
The residents of Los Angeles were exaggerated after the crowd of the sworn men had destroyed four white police officers who had killed black-collar Rodney King in 1992.
This year the anti-government demonstrations in France, carrying yellow chameleons – yellow jeans – for more than six weeks, are empty and expand the streets of Paris.
The minister pointed to Johnson's warning in the Gmin Election and said that if Great Britain can't get out of the EU, there would be "a disastrous loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum with 30 million people and 66% of them will be told about the rest of the United Kingdom in the European Union, ten million citizens will be unhappy," said the Minister.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we'll have 100,000 angry people who'll write to their jobs and who won't quit.
Many don't need to see hundreds of thousands in the streets soon.
One of the main ministers of the branch added that the country is threatened by "a violence to social life", if the results of the first referendum are questioned by the results of the second.
Johnson called for the general elections in which the voters were to discuss the Brexit Forest.
According to the findings, the prime minister is at risk of a bureau building that wishes to reduce demand in relation to Brexit and achieves this compromise agreement with the EU.
The capitals, the Chubows and the Crosnes were welcomed in Krakow.
Talk'N"Roll for us.
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) 11 encouraging representatives, including Szymon Holovnia, Kristina Czubovna or Ireneusz Krosny.
It's all in the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Enlargement of horizons, discussion on the value added and joint discussions that can be an incentive for further development.
These goals were set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, offering at the scene 11 exceptional presidents, representing very different industries and areas of interest, and among them are other people known from the media - Szymona Holovnia, Czubovnija and Irenaeus Krosna.
The theme of the current edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NEW" and just around creating the future, guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session was opened by the Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Trewiecki, who told of how the brand that is building around him might have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went to the scene to change the public's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted if they want to create the future, and Chris Badura also took on the subject of empathy in the age of flexible technology development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-stakeholder talk with Christine Czubovna, who told others about how from her perspective on space for years the teacher’s career in Poland changed.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that today, thanks to development technology, this profession can be difficult for everyone.
However, it does not consider that in the near future man has been entirely replaced by technology.
After her, Peter Nabeleek also faced a problem of life in times of information, emotional or electoral pressures, sharing the public's valuable points, how to deal with it, and Lukash Lütoch, in his statement, said what the next industrial revolution, known as "Industrial 4.0", could lead to.
Playing lessons, having fun
The organizers of the conference also expressed their artistic impressions, asking for an illusion scene, Daniel Unique.
The third part of the conference opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the pantonism public, and then, for example, on his own career, told how he was trying to maintain the proper balance between the career on stage and private life.
The participants also rejected Szymon Holovnia, stressing the role of time in our lives above all.
The publisher noted that even two minutes can permanently remove the situation and must be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared her thoughts about the reality of our reality, including anecdotes that could cause smiles on the faces of the eyes.
Next appeared in the scene, Adrian Truuszka, who reviewed the history and the objectives of several innovation models and brought them to the way they are used today.
At the end of Marcin Slovakiak, for example, Rubik's bones, told about how to solve problems.
Each of the 11 presidents has certainly proposed something new to observe the reality of all those who have the opportunity to look at the events and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests about the great involvement of the public.
The organizers provided a transmission for all who could not personally participate in the event, and recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
The courts are legal instead of governments.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the majority have introduced a number of changes in the State system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the third party of power," says the fourth report of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.
The Court of Justice, instead of governments, documents inter alia changes in justice and fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published in the fourth report entitled “The Court of Justice instead of Governments.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation assesses that in 2015-2019 the largest regression in the protection of human rights in Poland has been observed since 1989.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the majority have introduced a wide range of changes in the State system, creating threats to the protection of the rights and principles of the third party.
By adapting the law to political objectives, governments have replaced the law with the law," writes HFPC experts.
What's HFPC's report?
The report records changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair process).
The report also sums up for three years the dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to the realization of partial party interests.
This has been translated into an ongoing legal crisis, as well as to the weakening of the entire human rights protection system in Poland," stressed lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of Human Rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are "systemic changes both in the country and in the field of human rights protection".
Over the past four years, Sejm has adopted more than 20 key legal acts from the point of view of the protection of human rights.
"The changes were often accepted in a rapid pace, without social consultation and despite the preservation of the legal environment, the Ombudsman's Law or international organisations," explained lawyer Malgorzata Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the lack of respect for the reasons and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the protection of human rights".
State authorities have not responded
In particular, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights has recognized "these situations in which state authorities have not responded or have simply learned about acts of aggression".
The Foundation's experts noted that some changes were introduced into the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or groups of professions or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of State activity in the area of delimitation of the rule of law is a constant support of the Polish authorities with the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international lawmakers.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in the Central-East European region, but also puts the Polish state in charge of violating the law of the European Union or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brothers of Pakistani social media starling for honorary murder
Women's rights experts claim that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of prolonged proceedings, the release of suspects of torture and the closure of public opinion.
"It's a long way for people to forget," says Farzan Bari, defending women's rights and the first female employee in Pakistan who is studying gender at the university, and adds that even a wide-ranging issue of Baloch's murder has been discussed for over three years.
Despite the difficult data set by the group fighting for women's rights, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 found that at least 300 cases of such humiliating killings were found.
Many activists claim that the real number is significantly higher, and a network promoting awareness of the crimes of honour reasons predicts that Pakistan has about one fifth of the 5000 homicides worldwide.
Poland's border-recorded record-keeping
However, transfers to the country are small because many immigrants are outside Poland on a permanent basis – the fifth edition of the “Rzeczpospolita”.
According to the latest Euro-Tax report, Poland's average earnings in other European countries amounted to more than 8.6 thousand dollars in 2018, which means that almost a thousand gold has increased by almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "believes that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the Union reached a recorded value of 154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than a year earlier," we read.
Director of the Research Centre at the University of Warsaw Migration, Pavel Kaczmarczyk says that Poland is increasingly working on the international labour market, where various options are used.
"There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who, in search of better conditions, move from country to country, like international corporations' workers," the newspaper reports.
Some Euro-Taxu clients work in two countries, e.g. Great Britain and Germany.
"This is the largest in the RFN in 2018, as the total number of Polish immigrants increased by 11 per cent (up to 27 billion).
However, the largest Polish prisoners on the island - almost 35 billion evils," we read on.
The President of the Euro-Taxu considers that despite the improvement of working conditions in the Polish market, the number of unemployed immigrants is not small.
I'm still in the West and North of Europe (Norway) because it's often a chance for several times higher thefts than in Poland.
"This is even under the minimum rates in the country concerned, such as in Germany, amounting to EUR 9.5 to 11.7 per hour," the newspaper reports.
The "Special Policy" states that Poland is not only on the basis of higher labour, but also because it has agreed to a limit.
Many Poles are leaving behind a border crossing, which is also seen after the low transfers of money to the country.
These birthdays were the lowest of the year.
As economist Tadeusz Kristęcki recalls, with the extension of the period of stay beyond the borders of a small group of people who transfer money to the country and reduce their height.
"Emigrants tend to be close to each other," we read in the fifth "Treaty of the Middle Ages".
Long-term monsoons cause causes and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India is nearly a month long, and unforeseen floods cause death as a result of drought and floods.
In the northern Indians, monsun is usually at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for several days, it will be the last monsoon of the decade.
In many parts of the country, floods are still undisputed – in recent times the city of Pune in the west of India has led to the death of several people and the destruction of buildings.
There's been an explosion of houses, people burned through the street after the knees, which usually only happens during the monsoon apage.
Great floods have also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Haydarabad.
The result of long-term floods in the northern state of Uttarakhand many homes have been destroyed.
Monsun also started to be late.
There was a shortage of water in many areas, so farmers were preparing for a possible drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not pleasant seen by farmers.
Such a quantity of rain is not normal this time of year.
"With it, my crops – and now I have a kappus, fasol, grass and migrating – will disappear," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small economy in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the effect of late and late monsoon is a double price of the cell, i.e. an unexpected component of Indian food.
Cebula, which was usually required to pay 20 rupees (0.23 British pounds), currently costs 80 rupees (about 1 British pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
There are also festivals and festivals.
The next big festival is the 8th of October, in which Hindus raise huge balls, such as the comic, representing Ravana, to become a heavy burden and a smile from the era of "Ramajana".
The burning of Ravany symbolizes triumph of good over evil.
However, given the fact that Ravan's character was made out of paper, if the monsoon continues, it's just that Ravana will laugh last.

Doodle celebrates 21 birthdays of Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the searcher we are looking for answers to all our questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "Where?" is one of the favorite categories of Polishs.
As a result of the giant data last year, we were eager to ask, "Where's the burza?", "How to make swords?" and "How many fingers have horses?", "How to get rid of the fruit?", "How to eat?".
Today, the search engine is dealing with the twenty-first generation today.
Its users – and in Poland up to 96% of people benefit from "Google's daughter" – today special Google Doodle is welcome.
This time it's not animated.
Google remembers his births, showing a computer station with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, a digital date was printed – as in the 90s picture.
Catalogue of information
The searcher was established for a specific purpose – she had to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googool indicating the number of ten raised to the sixth power.
This name was also to reflect the company's intention to index as the largest number of pages from the world's Internet resources.
Google searcher was founded by Sergey Brina and Larry Page in 1996 under their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the usual method of segregating results based on the frequency of this phrase.
At the beginning of the searcher, the searcher named BlackRub, related to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linked to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company operating under Google Inc. 7 September 1998, and shortly thereafter they ran the audio website google.com.
What's up, Google?
In December 1998 the information on the very great tragedy of Google's search results appeared in the PC Magazine.
Then the company's history looks less like the bikini - the flashy development with each month, the collapse of further markets and the increase in company value.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL address index has more than a billion positions, making the work of Page and Brina the world's largest Internet search engine.
The company currently established by Page and Brina is one of the key players on the IT market.
So is there another field for development?
"The mission of Google is to organize global information resources to be widely available and useful, even though we have made huge progress in this area, it is still a long way ahead of us to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalewski of Google Poland in a talk with "Newsweek".
Frequent contact with pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and brain failure
The new study suggests that work with the development of contact with plant protection measures in large concentrations may be at high risk of heart failure in later years.
This was the case with a group of Americans from Japanese origin in Hawaii, which has been studied for over 30 years.
Researchers have found that compared with men who did not work with plant protection measures, those who had greater contact with them were 45% more vulnerable to heart disease or stroke.
"This investigation underlines the need for the use of personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of evidence in medical documentation of such means in work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a medical professor at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa District.
The results are based on data from over 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the Honolulu Cardiological Programme.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the studies may not apply to women and other populations, since it involved only males of Japanese origin.
Pesticians have a long period of half-life, so their effects on their health can tell you about themselves many years after contacting these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of observation, the relationship between pesticides and heart disease was no longer significant. ”
It was so likely that the most important factors related to ageing that masked possible causes-effectal relationships between contact with pesticides and disease in later years of life were more important.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small amounts of plant protection measures and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zełenski-Trup phone call: Adults doll their three big
Washington's policy has been busy for weeks to start the procedure against US President Donald Trump
The political scandal is for the political debtor of the Greens situation who would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zełenski-Trup affair and will it have far-reaching effects for the first of them?
At the beginning of the telephone interview, Trump told Zełenskie that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than for the European countries.
Despite the fact that the White House revealed that the notes are incomplete, they describe in detail the attack on the German Chancellor Angelj Merkel by the German leadership and other leaders of European countries in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
Controversy prompted Zełenski's response, which revealed that it agreed not to 100% but to 1000%.
Zełenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are trying not enough to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views has led politicians, especially from Ukraine's opposition, to take a vote through social services.
Peter Porossenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was unprecedented".
In other blogs, Poroszenko said it is grateful for the EU's "Russian aggression" support, which included sanctions and financial aid.
Others expressed their concern, including Ukrainian politician Victoria Voysitska, who said: “How can we talk now with Germany and France?"
He then mentioned the military assistance and asked Zełenski to investigate not one but two things: the first concerning the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the second related to the collapse of the DNA server, suggesting that Ukraine was engaged in a hacking attack on the e-mail democracy during the 2016 elections.
We do not know whether this represents European relations, or whether the negotiations will be concluded with the French and German leaders.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We are grateful for all the help we have received" – he announced after publishing a telephone call to Zełenski in New York during the United Nations General Assembly.
Zełenski has to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France on the nearby island of "the normative Square", which is to take place in October.
The defence inspectors were legally convicted
The court has cleansed Jerze Wisniewski of his crimes.
After six years, Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleaned out of the syringes.
The District Court in the Industry cleared Jerze Wisniewski, former head of the Vjevodska Inspectorate of the Quality of Trade Articles of Agriculture and Food in the Region, from the infringement of powers.
The Lubelska prosecutor accused him of betraying the same Marshl's control term in the food-producing oil plant.
He recently had a legitimate cause in this case.
The appeal was recognised on 12 September.
"The court has held the case against the accused," confirmed Judge Malgorzata Reiser, the judge of the District Court of Industry.
It concerns the issue of 14 February issued by the Regional Court of Industry.
Jerzy Wisniewski commented on Facebook: “Six years have passed since I was presented by the Appeals Prosecutor in Lublin for a series of violations of the right to telephone contact with Marsłki Vojevojdzeka Podkarpakki on 30 April 2012.
The court simply ruled that I was innocent and did not break the law in force.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation with Marshal Vojevodwa Podkarpakki was in line with the applicable law.
The version of the events published by the appellate Prosecutor in Lublin in 2013 was true and resulted in irrevocable damage to both the food producer and the loss of the vision of my person in my employers, employees and local society.
In my opinion, the Court has found a number of errors, false facts, inaccurate explanations of the legal basis, which are not confirmed in the facts of the case.
With the help of the CBA in Russia, everything was done to remove me from public and professional life.
At the same time, I was immediately released from work and out of financial resources.
I've been staying with my wife for a long time."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wisniewski performed the role of the trade quality inspector for agricultural and food articles in 2009-2013.
He was dismissed from the position after his sentence was filed in 2013 by the prosecutor in Lublin.
In the view of the investigation, he had in his phone address betrayed the current military commander (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years of deprivation of liberty) for a period of control in the food-producing oil plant belonging to the wife of the former vice-martial subcarp.
This warning, as the prosecutors of Lublina claimed, was to cause the owner of the company to know about control and to correct labels on oil that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard of the abuse of rights, which threatened him until he was three years old.
"I am pleased that this case has finally reached its end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
I have been convinced from the beginning that I have not done anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the legal cause of my arrests," Jerzy Wisniewski comments.
White House tried to hide the conversation with Green
In a report published on Thursday, the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to the President of Ukraine, held an interference with the US elections, and the White House tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, a likely reporting officer, he wrote: “I have been informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president has used his role to address the country’s interference in the 2020 elections in the United States. ”
‘Trup used part of the conversation (with Zełenski) to realize its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to press the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the re-election in 2020, a report quoted by the newspaper The Hill.
The Ukrainian leader was "developed" that his contacts with Trump were dependent on whether he would "show willingness to take the game" in matters that President Rudy Giuliani had specifically informed him about.
The author admits that he was not a witness, but emphasized that he had been informed in detail about his presence by “many of the White House officials who had direct information on this matter, ” and their relations were covered.
“In the days following this conversation, I learned from many U.S. officials that the high level of representatives of the White House had intervened in order to "break up" all the archival records on this conversation , and in particular the written record that has been prepared, as is usually done in the crisis room of the White House ,” we read.
“The White House officials told me that the White House's lawyers “can’t have them” to remove an electronic record from the information system in which such records are stored.
The entry has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information particularly confidential," the author of the report wrote.
“In my assessment, these steps testify to the fact that the White House officials considered themselves to be responsible for what happened during the conversation,” the signalist assessed.
According to the AP agency, this document will ensure a swift process of the President's investment, and it will also contain valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The Green White House, after the press Congress, was made available in the environment, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationships of those who were witnesses to it.
The content of the report, in the revised version, was revealed on the day following the report of the Committee of Representatives.
In his fourth duty, the Director of the U.S. Report, Joseph Maguire, also notified the Committee of the Election of Representatives and made clarifications on the manner in which he dealt with the report by the staff member.
Maguire said that the signalist made his own choice and acted as he ordered.
He also stressed that his view of the conversation with Zełenski was a “without precedent”.
The Democrats of the Committee asked Maguire why he blocked access to the Congress's signalist report; the director of the report said that he did not have the right to disclose his content, which is a secret character guaranteeing the executive authority so far.
The part of the Maguire hearing by the Commission was closed by the doors.
On Tuesday, the presidential election of the representatives of Nancy Pelosi announced that due to the suspicion that the president had used pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the election of the representatives would be against the investigation that might lead to the imputation of the troops.
The day after that, she assessed that the record of the Trupa's conversation with Zełenski confirms that the US president broke the rules on elections and security.
Election law in the United States prohibits the use of state aid.
However, the Court of Justice assessed that the president had not violated the right of election. On Thursday, White House spokesman Stephanie Grisham said that there was nothing "inconsistencies", and in the report, "there is nothing more than a third-hand relationship and a set of free actions".
"The White House will continue to criticise this history of the media and the false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana receives two ICAO awards
Ghana received two prizes during the ongoing 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was granted in evidence that Ghana received the highest number of points for Air Safety Control in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent for the time-limit for the Implementing Implementing (EI).
It came to an end when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Safety Authority General Audit Programme.
The protection award was evidence of the country's high involvement in the implementation of ICAO protection standards and protocols on airports and in the Ghany airspace.
The award programme has been developed to ensure the support of ICAO initiative No.
In addition, 16 other safety and safety certificates and 17 protection certificates were granted to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and protection standards.
During the award for Ghany, he was currently Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Civil Aviation Office of Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghany in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Director-General of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumiyawa Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain safety in the airspace by Member States.
He stated that “it is important that we constantly remind ourselves that even in the time of innovation, the safety of aviation protection and sustainable development must remain our fundamental priorities”.
Mr. Adda, on his side, noted that the rewards were a huge achievement for the efforts of the State, as they are complementary to the hard work and the sustainability of the industry.
He also added that the airport industry has a huge potential for developing the country's economy, saying "the airport has the potential to change our lives.
These are social and economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection that we have been able to achieve."

Trip named Peter Gaynor on the head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), shall laugh at the meeting of the Senate Sub-Commission on National Security on the proposal of the FEMA for the financial year 2020 at the Capital Summit in Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – White House announced that on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor will be the successor of the FEMA administrator to the head of the agency who controls the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has been operating without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March when it released this position.
Long rejected the fact that the U.S. Department of National Security, which is a member of the FEMA, found that Long was unjustly using government vehicles for vehicles between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was excommunicated earlier this month, when the exact verification of his past revealed that he was taking part in the fight in the bar.
The appointment of Gaynor to this position was expected.
To confirm his appointment to this role, the majority will be required in the Senate.

Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian fugitive, considering the amputation of the thumb
The 28-year-old runner specializes in the distance of 1500 metres, gaining gold medals from Europe in 2012, Helsinki, September 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also a European multiple teacher for 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it is not new tolerance and that he has already passed one operation immediately after the season in 2016, but the pain has returned and has been very violent in the current season.
Pain causes me to take a step that, in turn, changes my body’s system, follows other unnatural burdens and starts to feel pain in other places, for example in the liver.
For this reason, I couldn't prepare enough for the world's mysteries, and for two weeks it's so hard that I have trouble putting balls – said a runner on the NRK TV channel.
The father and coach, Gjert Ingebrigtsen, admitted that after long discussions with his son, the only solution to not finish his career and participate in the future Olympic Games in Tokyo will be amputation.
It looks like it's the only one, although the drastic solution and the decision have already come true.
"If the part of the body is suffering, it must be removed, and in fact Henrik does not need this thumb so much and in this situation it must be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police closing illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in San Gabriel Valley.
At the office building at the 9600 Telstar Avenue Street, about 16:37 was built, during which the police searched for illegal e-paper sales containing marijuana and during which there was found a large glass containing bottled wine – a concentration of Indian coins.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte police, the officers also found devices that were used to complete the vaccination contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who once worked in drugs, says that the oil distillation used in vaccine products is a potentially easy process.
"The usual electrostatic demand from our tanks can cause the burning of these furnaces, not only fire but also concentration, even explosions," he says.
“If we have a lot of layers and similar ones in the room, after one explosion the next occurs, resulting not only in fire, but also in explosions that could put the whole complex out of the surface.
The Bureau was invited to work on special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is not currently known.
The detectives say they received an anonymous guide that allowed them to get a search warrant, thus finding illegal activity.
Followers continue to try to obtain information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person was interested in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation continues and officials want to be sure that illegal products have not been found on the street, taking into account the recent articles on the injury of smoking.
"People really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may be a threat to our society and to our children, so we always keep them in front of this sort of thing.

The banknote is to enter the 2nd October of the deposit to 55,000 pieces.
One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All coins and banknotes issued by the NCBs, including those from the special series, are legally payable in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collection market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, or more than two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transferred to a special platform at Easton port where it was loaded on a boat.
That's where he flew 50 miles.

The exhibition of the deceased Elżbiety I in the Hampton Court Palace
The recharged silver thread made from the most famous single chamber has been artificially decorated by hafts representing plant, animal and motility.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation exhibition, this meant only one thing.
The wall of a 100-year-old wall on the wall of a small parish church that she looked at could be the only part of Elsebeth I's garden.
Three years after Lynn was hit by the incident at an altar tower in Bacton in the town of Herefordshire, the lost Elżbiet's dog is to be found in the next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same places in which the king of Tudor's dynasty could carry it over 450 years ago.
The importance of this discovery is that from the whole collection of royal sins, only one element of the XVI eternal sine survived.
Although there is no compelling evidence that Elżbieta ever wore this dress, three years of research encouraged experts to believe that she had to be part of the royal garden.
"Srebrogels", of course, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the quartor's quality of farmed plants and flowers, later enriched with hunting, dogs, motleys, fish and ignorance, indicates that the killer was among the most significant of the people.
Suknia, when she was expelled, could cost the equality of Tudor's property.
"More than that, at the age of 90, or at the end of Elżbiet's panic, she felt the threat of other women at the door and would not tolerate rabies carrying such fabric," says Lynn.
“As a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at their shoes.
I was really happy to see the dress, and they were attracted to it, and they were practically convinced that we had an element of the royal garden before us.
Long, repeated life is short, forced to serve as an altar cloth in the dark St. Faith church in Bacton, it is not as surprising as it might seem.
Bacton is the property from which Blanche Parry, the closest lady to the court, who served the king for the rest of her life, and with which in local legends was the property of the deceased.
Although the pig was born after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elżbieta had to give it to the Parry family or parafia when Blanche remembered his death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservative work, four of which resulted in the longest hand-made chain with specially colored wire and thin surgical needles, the ultrasound track on the exhibition’s exhibition near the Hatfield House at the exhibition’s “Rainbow Portrait” exhibition, one of the most recent contemporary pictures of Elżbiet was taken in a similar dress.
"When you work with the historical cloths, you really begin to admire the art of people who have done it," says Libby Thompson, the chief conservative work, most of which took place in a scaffolded for this purpose in the Hampton Court Palace – the only big place to place some of the priceless palace Gobels.
“Looking at the Haft from the front and the back, I began to feel a great respect for those who did it.
I've never worked on something so elite.
The exhibition “The Lost Dress of Elizabeth” begins on 12 October in the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch Agency confirmed rating Poland with a stable outlook
The Fitch Agency confirmed the long-term rating of Poland in the currency of the euro at the ‘A-’ level – given in the communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macro-economic and well-developed economies that are supported by reasonable economic policy and the strong banking sector," we read in a Communication from the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was in the midst of a Connique cycle, and in the years 2019-2021 the real growth rate of Brutto National Product in Poland will be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency estimates that the deficit of the government and self-government sector to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below the limit of 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively.
"The rate of government and self-government debt to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent by the agency and will be lower in the years to come (mean 48.3 per cent in 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polski
A series of reviews of Poland's rating will be completed on 11 October by S&P and Moody's.
Rating Polski in the Fitch Agency evaluation remains the same as published at the end of March 2019.
At the time, the agency confirmed the rating of Poland at the level of "A-" with a stable outlook.
Among the three largest rating agencies, Poland's highest rating of Moody's credit rating is “A2”.
Rating Polish according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
The prospects of all evaluations are stable.
What's rating?
Rating agencies are established to assist investors in assessing the risk of their investment activities.
Ratings are awarded to companies, banks and the state.
In the case of the latter, each assessment shall be subject to economic attraction.
Rating is nothing but a credit credibility assessment.
It is based on decisions on who and how much money to earn.
Sometimes such information also suggests that it is best not to make any credit at all, because there is a higher risk that money cannot be recovered.
The lower rating is linked to higher risk.
On the other hand, the higher risk is a high percentage of credit.
Each assessment must be reasoned and interpreted.
Ratings may be manipulated, but in such a case, agencies risk loss of reputation.
At this time, over 90 percent of the world's rating services market are controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of these uses its own system of assessments.
"Fiveth of the Confederation": First 1000 plus
‘Fiveth of the Confederation’ means the main implementation of the electoral programme, which was presented on Friday in Kosovo to the Seym from around 40 on the mandate of the KW Confederation of Freedom and Indivisibility.
The leader of the Kossilian letter to Seym Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the title “Fiveths of the Confederation”.
"After the first 1000 plus programme for Poland, the second quick and fair trial, the third cultural and cultural benefits, the fourth national security, and the fifth is healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He noted that "police must finally start to work well," so the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with free tax is going to grow."
"In order to be able to make a choice where they want to save their money on retirement, i.e. PIT zero and voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list on the implementations of the 1000 plus programme for Poland.
Instead, Aleksandra Zadencka, starting from the second place of the list, referring to the program title "healthy life" said that "food is increasingly quality" and to change it, it is necessary to "support Polish farmers, Polish farmers" to act on the rights of free GMOs.
As she said, the Confederation is also talking about stopping the “stigmatization of syllables”.
Zadencka declared support to the Confederation for "the development of a natural resource-use building".
She also said on behalf of her group of “good-willed vaccines”.
"It can't be a violation of the right to a known agreement," she added.
Further applications to the Seym from the Kossilian District emphasized that the Confederation is to "be able to carry out a profound reform of the judiciary", which should include a trial by the judge "day after day".
It was also said that the global subsidy would go to school without self-government, i.e. without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The confederation is also a "strong Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates to Seym stressed the need for an increase in military numbers.
According to them, it also requires easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "full access to energy".
"We can gasp the coal, we have a bit of geotermal energy, we need to look back to the idea of nuclear power," said Piotr Karpinski, the fifth on the list of elections.
The head of the Mexican cartel stands for one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just east of the West Side in Chicago CBS News related the morning drug situation.
Brian McKnight from the D.D.D.'s Office in full light showed what's going on.
In Chicago last year nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McKnight said "probably 90%" drug addicts in Chicago come from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesie, known simply as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for DEA and directly for the federal executive bodies in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, head of DEA in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped to discover dozens of places in El Mencho's drug labs.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs that reach the USA by the route of land and sea.
In the view of the Department of Justice, the cartel has produced "tonnes" cocaine, methamphetamines and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a reward of $10 million.
As an irony, he lived in California some 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug-related crimes and was eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has a large amount of weapons, RPG, 50 calibrated weapons.
Basically has its own SWAT team," Donahue added.
El Mencho without food protects his empire, using such measures as the bombing of a Mexican army helicopter, to kill six people or to participate in a public campaign this year.
In recent years the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occur each day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be taken without a protective equipment.
In the kitchen package laboratory is the brand of the manufacturer.
For more than one third of them, they lead to El Mencho's cartel.
"It is responsible for sending a terrorist who kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So when a child dies, Donahue believes there is a "long chance" that drugs come from El Mencho.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year from overdose.
France: 27 years old, President of France and his wife
The 27-year-old man tried to seduce Emmanuel Macron and the first lady – French prosecutor's claim.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents that compromise the presidential pair.
He asked the Head of State for 300 thousand euros in cash.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police claim to have received from the person employed in the Elisha Palace documents.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but their disclosure may pose a threat to the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
Instead, he asked for 300 thousand euros in return – he also wanted to get a residence in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, the accused refused to transmit the documents he had mentioned to the police.
He said that the transmission would be medium, but we do not know if these documents really exist.
They were not found during the audition in the residence of this 27-year-old.
The man was subjected to psychiatric tests, but the doctors did not suspect any serious complications.

Run, race and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskida and will want to win.
Stomil's pilots from three bikes are infamous.
At that time, the loyal Peter Zwdzkowski won seven points because they won with St. Mielec and Chojniczánk Chojnice, and in the final match, he fell free of charge in the Suwałkas.
Now the Baltic team will take Podbeskida on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is changed as one of the factories to advance to the Extraclass.
The nearest Stomil Rivers take the fourth place in the table and have a point of view over the team from Olstyna.
At the end of the season, he played six times and won two victories, remiss and defeats Natomist Stomil very well on his property – at the stadium at the Al. Piłsudski 69a of the Piotra Ządzkowskii, he won three times and he won.
A total of 17 points were collected in ten rows and are in the top of the table, although after two breaks at the age of the game, there was nothing to say.
"Every change takes time to be a result," explains Piotr Skiba.
"Well, and finally something's gone wrong with us, we believed in ourselves, but we can work under normal conditions.
We were just getting together for the ball game.
They're clean heads, it's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong school."
On Tuesday, Stomil's pilots graduated from Puchar Polski Roch Chorzow, but they needed the corrections and a series of military routes.
In southern Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not leave because the trainer Ządzkowski gave the key to rest before the Saturday trip to Podbeskid.
On the other hand, in Croatia, he played a reconnaissance of Jacob Moscow, who finally shot his long - awaited arm.
“It’s always nice to get naked, and I’ve been in such a time that this allows us to continue playing in the dolls (Moscawski said at 3:3 in the 119th minute – no.).
My father often corrected me and laughed that I couldn't get the arms, and I always told him that I would shoot him at such a time as he wouldn't have expected."
Moscow is now counting on the return to the basic composition, which is more likely to be unable to play Ołeh Tarasenko because of the yellow cards.
"After that, I insist heavily on training to be able to play in the first warehouse," says Moscow.
“In Croatia, I did everything I could to represent myself as best.
But whether I'm gonna play or sit on a reserve chain, I'm going to be as strong as I can support the team.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskid.
We are certainly waiting for a difficult meeting in which victory will have to run, disarm and fight."
In the middle of the Ossetian defense, Rafał Remisz may still play, which has recently also been attacked, so whether he's up, we'll find out just on Saturday, more that the Tswanzkowski traditionally tries to keep himself in the dark.
A man raped and murdered his sister
“You will never see the light of the day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, turning to Alexa Whipple.
"What you did was so exciting and sad that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple indicated where the body was hidden.
"How could anyone do this to his own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, the little girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," said Alexa Whipple.
"I'd leave everything to meet her again, hug," said the mother of the murdered girl.
“Our life will never be the same anymore,” added a depressed woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotions during the interview.
In the past month, he admitted that he had abused, abused, and murdered the girl.
A male lawyer claimed that his client was raised in an “unperfect family. ”
He should have been tortured like a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has done terrible things and is ready to suffer.
A man was sentenced to life without the possibility of obtaining a conditional release.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would deliver nearly $100 million of additional funds to the dry society.
The programme to provide money to farmers affected will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of additives to the economy will be simplified.
The aid package covers nearly $34 million in support of the drought-affected society initiative, making it possible to receive up to $3,000 in urgent cases to qualify for economic aid.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the Social Assistance Programme will receive up to $1 million of infrastructure grants and help to deal with the impact of disasters.
The new support package is an addition to more than $7 billion for government funds for the fight against drought.

Chinese (In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters)
documentary film: In China, the number of divorces has increased twice in the last decade.
The cause of this condition was the generality of the third person.
More and more men maintain romantic relationships, which has led to the formation of a special industry in this country – a professional group of lovers who are committed to the saving of their wives.
Let's dance aloud: Ma-te-usz!
An attempt to encourage the Prime Minister in the Czech Republic
A formal trial was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateus Moraweck in the Czech Republic.
"The state, the vote, the vote, we do not welcome Mr. Prime Minister here!
Let's dance aloud: Ma-te-usz!", he strongly urged the leader.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic leadership did not produce the expected result.
The campaign's in progress.
Politicians travel throughout the country, convincing themselves of the voters.
The intensive campaign is also carried out by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is often a guest in the region as leader of the Swiss list of PiS.
Each meeting is well planned, including appropriate training.
It was the same, and most of all, it had to be in the Slavic Peters.
Please note that a special guest should be invited in particular.
Before the meeting with the prime minister, the current manager decided to carry out a general test.
He tried to encourage the crowd to scan the name of the head of the government.
“This will not be welcome to me, except for Mr. Matthew's Prime Minister!
And the voice, the voice of my droids!", he urged outspokenly.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not give up completely on the hot weather of the leader and responded eagerly to "Ma-te-usz", but the recording of the enthusiastic control of the fires in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man sentenced to the murder of his ex-wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring in Texas.
The authorities seem to have entered the house of Stayov on 9 July 2014, asking to reveal the location of his wife, Melanie Haskell, who was in separation.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stey and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stey, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as said the Bureau of Sheriff Hrabstwa Harris.
He survived only one family member, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said it was a serious wound, but it was able to heal her completely.
In the fourth quarter, the Polish members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defence on the basis of inadmissibility.
The curse of the sworn oaths will come again on Monday to issue a statement.
Quantantum Internet growing closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army's research are using the Internet to make the move closer.
Such an Internet could provide military security, detection and accuracy of time-consuming in traditional approaches to the creation of the network.
The Centre for the Dissemination of Quantum Processing Information of the Military Research Laboratory ds. Development of the possibilities of the U.S. Army Watched Researchers from the University of Insbruck, which was able to achieve record transfer of the state between the material and the light – 50 kilometres with the use of light cables.
It's a correlation that can arise between quants such as cubes.
When two cubes are filled and one of them is measured, it will have an impact on the size of the other one, even if the other cube is physically removed.
"These [50 kilometers] are two rows of size as far as possible and it is an effective distance to start the inter-monetary networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physics from the University of Innsbruck and a major researcher in a project that is published in Nature magazine, Quantum Information section.
Intermediate quota networks would be made up of remote ports of physical cubes, which are filled with themselves in spite of the greater physical distance.
Researchers have found that this extension of the filled state is necessary for the creation of a quota Internet.
"This demonstration is a step forward towards achieving a wide-ranging state of disintegration," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-chairing the military programme supporting the investigation.
The quality of the condition filled at the second end after the passing of the lamp is also so high that it can meet some of the most difficult applications of the quota network.
The research team began an experiment from the atom of evaluation in the drop of iron.
With the help of lasers researchers, they entered the jon's state of jon, while encouraging him to exaggerate the photo in which the quantified information was stored.
As a result, quantification of atoms and particles of light were filled.
The challenge is to send a photo with a light cable.
"The photo taken by ion wafnia has a length of 854 nanometres and is quickly taken by light," said Lanyon.
That is why his group initially sent out a piece of light through a non-linear crystal illuminated with a powerful laser change.
The length of the photo file was converted to the optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to a large distance – the current standard telecommunications length was 1550 nanometres.
Then the researchers sent this photo through a 50-kilometre light cable.
Their measurements show that atoms and particles of light continue to be filled even after the transformation of the length of the wave and the passage of that distance.
‘The choice of fuel means that this result leads directly to the creation of a full network of atomic shocks at large physical distances, as the fuel can be combined with a high-quality "fire".
The army is very interested in large-scale grids built on the use of precise positions, accurate navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-operates with the programme.
