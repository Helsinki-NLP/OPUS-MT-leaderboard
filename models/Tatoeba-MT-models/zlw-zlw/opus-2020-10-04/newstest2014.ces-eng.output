Black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find money to repair the disintegrating highway networks, many start to see solutions in a small black box that fits easily into the instrument board of your car.
The devices that follow every kilometre that the engineer runs, and which transfer this information to the authorities, are the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and state planning authorities to renovate an outdated system of financing the US main roads.
Usually the phased design of motorways suddenly stimulated intense debate and the creation of various associations.
The Libertarians gathered together with groups of ecologists and weeded for the government to use these small lockers that would record the mile and maybe even where you're going – and then they would use this information to set up a tax diversion.
Tea party is terrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with privacy protection.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states wait for nothing.
They find out how during the following decade they can move to a system where the driver pays for a mile of roads that he drives.
Thousands of motorists already have black lockers, some of which have been monitored using GPS, have taken to test.
This is a real need for our nation.
"It is not a matter where we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, the Executive Director of the Association of State Administration in South California, which plans for this State to start monitoring of the mileage of every California engineer in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology serves to do so.
The fact is that the Road Trust Fund funded by the taxes that Americans pay at the pumping stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars are driving a lot more miles to one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18,4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are free to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The gas cost is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device up to 500 cars to test this system of payment for a mile.
"In the long term, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of miles away.
It is no surprise that this idea likes urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change the patterns of driver behaviour, for example, which can help reduce the traffic clamps and the production of greenhouse gases.
California Projectors shall look into this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious laws on global warming.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representer Pennsylvania), President of the Transport Committee, said that he also sees this as the most functional long-term alternative.
The leaders of the free market from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for a mile.
"It is not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Reason Strategy.
People pay directly for what they get.
Initiative is also supported by two former US Ministers of Transport, who encouraged Congress in 2011 to go towards paying for a mile.
The American Senate approved a pilot project for USD 90 million last year, which was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, management of the House of Representatives has rejected the proposal and has done so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the ingredients of the population, whose daily life often means to offend many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, who included 5,000 drivers in the biggest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the state tax for miles away, instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is investigating the project.
Illinois tries to a limited extent to cargo cars.
And the coalition of I-95, which includes 17 state transport ministries, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have an advocate.
In Nevada, where recently the facility was equipped with about 50 volunteer cars, the drivers were concerned by being able to monitor every movement of the government.
"Big Brother's surveillance concerns and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the management of the strategy and operation at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-value tracking devices.”
There is no need to build a tremendous difficult technological infrastructure that is inevitably expanding to the record of daily exits and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada belongs to several states who are trying to find available technology that would enable the state to track how many kilometres the car will go, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, he said Khan, the public will be quieter.
Hon brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance).
This company was originally involved in action to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the uprising market with legal responsibility where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they fucked.
But this device that he tries attracts attention to road network designers because he does not use GPS and only supplys a limited amount of information that is recorded regularly by modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
A number of major errors appeared in some of these pilot programmes.
They're much cheaper and less intriguing ways to do that.
In Oregon, the designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they may not take any facilities and instead choose to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres of all the residents of the State.
In other places, they hope that a prudent public will come to this concept if the device can learn more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop taxation facilities that would be equipped to pay parking hours in order to provide insurance according to miles away and to collect data on the speed of other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic traffic.
“Motorists will be willing to participate in this because of the value of the benefits they offer,” reports the City projection document.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all discussions on payment per kilometres are not just a huge crowded problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee on San Francisco bays say that Congress could very easily solve the problem with the bankruptcy of the Road Trust Fund by increasing the petrol tax.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid drivers or other vehicles that do not need many fuels so that a fair share will be paid.
"No radical operations are needed if it is sufficient to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee on Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
The ČSSD is negotiating Saturday.
Social democracy with spirals, folks and grandmothers speak and have a common procedure.
If the Social Democrats become confused within a few weeks, they will meet the meeting table with perfectly played partners, who will put a complete list of requirements, including ministerial posts, on the table.
CSSD emissaries then either swallow the acid coalition grapes, or chew on a drilling minority government.
Godslav Sobotka, after four days when he was carried on a wave of sympathy, first encountered.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political gremium and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator is only he, the other members of the team will be permitted after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the gremium and now to the citizens.
He's not supposed to lie, in his personal life, or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek.
He added that he did not lie at the post of the first Vice-President.
"I will communicate my decision on 10 November to the UVV," said Hašek.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and the chief of the Jerome Tajc Club spoke.
He, of course, warned that he was elected just two days ago.
The two Members then declared that they would do everything to make the 50-member ČSSD club sound one vote.
"I am a member of the ČSSD for 15 years, I have always been loyal to her mark and have respected the decisions of the parties."
They used to read another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget in the challenge of Saturday's resignation and his dismantling from the negotiating team that August's UVV had 57 percent of his sleep on the fact that Bohuslav Sobotka was a party candidate for the premiere?
But Chef of ČSSD, by convening the UVV until next Sunday, made a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media of the dreams of various rumors and rumors, eventually reminded the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
It's going to be a big fight of dirty laundry, there's signs of a dark alliance between uhlobarone Zdeňk Bakala and Saturday's wing.
A friendly relationship with Bohuslav Sobotka and a powerful Advocate Radk Pokorný will be discussed.
There are disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian Republic of the Czech Republic.
The words of the Ostravian primator and Sobotk allies of Peter Kajnar are equal: "I signed Chart 77 so that the country doesn't control idiots."
If the UVV had met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will scatter their head with ashes and stay.
And now the winner boss of the ČSSD then ends up with a nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Socha: Communication with Russia is difficult
His lips indicate a slight smile and then just breathe deeply: "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the organisational Olympiad team in Socha 2014 says Martin Doctor is a little more complicated.
We can forget about what was on the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What's going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, with regard to the supply of information on essential things, not so much.
Maybe we've been crying out of them for three months to give us how the villages will be officially marked so that we can do a whole number of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They keep communicating in a number of things.
Is there at least an Olympic village?
But it's not a catastrophic condition anymore.
We went to the empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just the base concrete, so that was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26, we'll still feel glue.
And if they don't, what's gonna happen?
President Putin would think of the army there?
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that the Olympic Village = Ciemkin's Village.
More likely, they won't make a trip adjustment, they won't make details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a condition that we'll have to take London games with us.
But I believe they're putting it together.
How many Czech athletes might be going to Sochi?
Now it's about 78, even if the number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the shrinks will probably go in the triple they left.
No one has to doubt about the fasteners Martina Sábliková, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still going to Socha?
No, if nothing happens, I should go there on January 26th.
What houses in the Olympic village look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by subway so that we don't just believe in sketches.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the mission chief do 100 days before the Olympics?
I'm preparing for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing a common agenda in terms of communication with the organization committee in Soch.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, the plan of hating him a giant secret dump.
Fans of winter sports are already cutting a meter until the opening of the Olympic Games in Socha, others are looking at more worrying.
The Russian Olympics, even if it starts in February, faces another scandal.
The Russians do not seem to be able to fulfill the promise that the preparation and making of games will not disturb the nature in Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be headed in four months.
In addition, after the Olympiad in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high, Canadian games entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "new waste" has already taken a long time for his.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered a giant dump of construction in the village Achštyr near Sochi.
So a dump full of building materials, tyres, cannasters and insulation foams found already in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities went down and the dump went missing.
Just for a second.
Last week, the reporters had a look at a dump about the size of three soccer plays.
She's not the only one, there were several places in this area, described the British Letter The Times.
There are Russian railways, state monopoly, which builds about six-six-meter routes between the airport in Socha and the sport resort.
One of the close Putin's associates of Vladimir Jakunin, had been led by the company, which had already swallowed 280 billion rubles.
In August, the railroads defended that someone of the subcontractors founded a dump.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštir around the village, three months ago and nights are driving trucks full of waste material.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminated the local river of Mzymt, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminated the socio water springs for the next ten to 15 years," said the British letter Vladimir Kimajev from the EWNC ecological nonprofit organization.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian Organization Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: the games in Soch will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 went to 43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the mentioned vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and fears, whether snow is enough, the reports also appear that human rights are not respected at the sports and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth on a protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers face a new law that prohibits promoting homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support the Russian gays on the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates received as an assignment to design the house on the parcel, which lies on the corner of two streets, while the property itself is considering somewhat.
In the request, it continued that two generations will live in the house, which would want to live together, but each should have their own clear space.
The younger couple needed an extra office.
The house stands at the corner of two streets and on a slightly considerable property.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family unions, history and memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
Parent's homeland is at the level of a garden with an old blueberry to which family traditions and memories relate.
Individual parts of the house are easily recognized from outside, because different final adjustments are different from the facade.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, whose surface was formed by panels from the boards, the part where the office is, is cast white and the remaining elements remain in the clean concrete design without any further modification.
Many walls of the house are completely glassed, which makes the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
The homey of parents, more precisely the kitchen, the dining room and the living room, surrounded by a small garden with a tree that has great significance for the family.
The interconnection of the interior with the exterior undercuts the side wall that begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall, and from there it rises down the stairs into its space.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their design allows cascades to pass through a lot of natural light.
That's what the architects tried to separate the house from others and print him something unique.
The homey of a young couple is treated as one open space with kitchenette, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace, it is divided only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living zone with dining and kitchen part in the home of young couple.
The second floor is complexed as one large open space that passes freely on the terrace, from where a nice view of the Tokyo bay is.
The office itself in the highest floor is captured in a clean combination of white and black colors.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple walk into the house by the main entrance, get in the entrance hall and then rise up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly challenged students' open letters, teachers and high school leadership in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign by President Miloš Zeman at school.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the Honorary President of the SPOZ - Zemanovce in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of a non-application of the Czech State Festival.
Here is a list of school leaders who no longer have been so brave and visited by Miloš Zeman allowed: High Technical Learning in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of Business in Ostrava, Trade Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuing enforcement of politics at universities.
The newly elected MEP for ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrotechnics and the ICTs of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function, and it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's not really the same as if you remained in the role of mayor of a smaller town.
Do you want to join the ČSSD flocks, who are extorting the function of the Member and the flock, and as well as they degrade both professions?
That's why you're telling people that both of these demanding functions can be handled by the left.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hask, who even handles dozens of functions at once.
But I guess that's not exactly the example of a person you should follow.
We will also find a reverse and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who prefers to leave the post of the Member in order to give full attention to the leadership of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the Dean's function is that you will break the academic land of Pardubice as a result of the function.
Paradubical ODS headquarters see your current effects on both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you will be able to help your school without being a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion like me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
Then consider your resignation and maintain your face.
Otherwise, it may be possible for you that the voters will count it in the next elections.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice, the drums don't add chemistry into it.
More than a thousand tons of sour greens want to produce in the following months in the Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to Hamé's food group.
The season started here in October and lasts about six months.
Healthy taste here since 1925 is still produced in a traditional way, i.e. by walking directly in big dances.
In modern industrial times, it's a rarith.
Our worker found a turning route of almost 10 kilometers.
In each of the ten tanks, fifteen to thirty tons of green, filling one lasts three shifts," said the director of the Slovacká Fruta David Kladroba race.
The guinea piglets are driven to the company's premises directly from their fields of farmers mainly from Ostrożnia and Brzeclavska.
The Fruta staff then cleanse the vegetables, remove the brooms and throw into the ring.
From there the already cut green falls into the pools by a six-meter depth, in which the hookers are unfairly dressed in white clothing and hobby.
That's what makes unwanted air clear.
The last strained layer of green shall be covered with a swim and loaded with water.
"The evil crane will then hurt six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation," stressed the director of Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production under domestic conditions, individual layers of workers spill salt and cumin.
The evil after the fermentation goes to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweetening lever for bags or glasses and is subject to sterilisation.
Hamé delivers poisonous greens mainly on the domestic and Slovak market.
Interest is also registered in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “collaborate” with Germany in connection with the US monitoring
Edward Snowden, a squadron from the U.S. intelligence services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to provide evidence to the German Parliament if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander are not able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
The German Member of Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and he was dealing with the possibility to testify with him in Germany.
In the letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP forwarded to the media on Friday in Berlin, it says: “But the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, the government continues to be opposition as a run and is trying to criminalize political speeches with severe laws that do not give room for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the government of the United States to withdraw criminal charges against him.
The charges lodged by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include spying and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of Interior, said for Zeit Online magazine: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to allow it.”
The tension between the US and Germany began to rise when the claim that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the parliamentary panel, who is supervising the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness, “without being threatened and that the relations with the US would be completely destroyed,” it should be done.
Mr Sträbel, a Member of Parliament on the German side of the Greens, published a photo on his twitter contribution, which is on Mr Snowden.
On their way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to the former contractual NSA lawyer Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be “safe,” said a member of Parliament.
Mr. Snowden in his letter said he was facing a rough and persistent campaign related to the persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said that the reaction of the whole world to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and high-school officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the detection of an unjustified system of all-time surveillance for the public service.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities, “when the difficulty of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
We're sorry for killing, but we're innocent, defending the Red Khmers' representatives.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is former head of state.
In 1975 to 1979, the Red Khmer government, which was based on a mixture of maoism and nacionalism, lost life as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, that is, at least a quarter of the population.
This commander, unfair prisoner S-21, granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010, a lifetime sentence.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, slavery and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the real extent of killing is.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understand everything, and then to hit and correct the situation," said Khieu Samphan on Thursday, before court.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered the Red Khmers to "take people wrong or kill them to deny their food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Five-50-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, AFP said she couldn't accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"Only, he wants to be discharged."
"He doesn't care about the other," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates would not kill," she added that the leaders of the Red Khmers are worse than the monsters.
He was also supposed to stand in front of the court, the "Minister of Foreign" of the Red Khmer regime, Ieng Sary, who died this March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, the former Minister of Social Affairs, found the court in September 2012 incapable of a dementia process.
The leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay the hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 for saving a hand luggage on board in its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce up to 100 USD per hand luggage and 2 USD for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday they said that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so the small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says that it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 if the passengers are to wait until the gate arrives.
The speaker of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a hundred-dollar fee is to encourage the passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not choose this fee," she said.
Air companies began to pay the first and second luggage submitted in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these charges and put into the hand luggage hidden in the storage space as often as they could, so there was often no place in this space.
The fees are one of the ways to teach the passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really is not to get more money.
The point is that Frontier's most trusted customers have made it clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is increasingly difficult.
Travelers who buy tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier's gate can bring a baggage for which they don't pay anything while the other passengers in the front pay 100 USD for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the website and the handling procedures will be adapted to ensure that the passengers are aware of the fee before their arrival to the gate.
The new fee for Frontier's hand luggage will not be valid until the summer but the date has not yet been set.
Travelers often complain about luggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the luggage costs money, and passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street perceive another luggage charge as a sign that airline companies are trying to select enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of loss.
But most of them didn't hit the hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge the hand luggage three years ago and the other low cost company Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company with such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says the air transport adviser Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his report of December 2011, he estimated that the Spirit’s hand luggage fee would bring $50 million annually.
Sorensen, former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when the passengers met with an unusual fee for Spirit's hand luggage.
“It was the easiest thing I've ever seen in my flight career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a toothbrush and arguing at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the entrance ran through in the skull.”
Frontier will also apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice after the Spirit model.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be supplemented for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, the US Airways attempted to introduce drink fees shortly, but after the passengers’ complaints seven months later, no other significant airline company had imitated it.
The last move of Frontier to pay the hand luggage if passengers do not buy flights directly from this airline, it is its last attempt to direct customers directly to their website.
Airline companies pay internet travellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This gave all airline companies an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, she began to give customers who bought through the Internet travel agency only half a mile in the framework of the loyalty program.
On the Wednesday, she cut the reward for the flighted mile to 25 percent of the miles from the journey.
So the journey with Frontier a long 1000 miles purchased through the Internet travel agency is a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in his home town Denver, but her business starts to stink and lose money.
According to the financial results mentioned in the mid-partner of the Republic Airways Holdings, the sales decreased by 9 percent and the transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
The Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
For crashing the NSA website does not blame hackers, but “inner error”
Mysterious National Security Agency stated last Friday that her website fell for a few hours last week due to an internal error, not to attack the hackers, as some claimed on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov sites were not available today for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates,” said the spy agency in the e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors recorded that NSA websites had not worked at least six hours, and the websites are still unavailable for some users.
Earlier spokesperson of the NSA station ABC News said that the internal sensitive networks of the Agency were not "sound" at risk.
The speaker said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one group of hackers on the Internet claimed that it was responsible for deleting the NSA website through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers fail and the site falls.
This cyber tactics is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former NSA super secretary agency, who had received a nickname No such agency, has become a total product of the separation of the NSA secret files from the Agency and their disproportionate ex-works of Edward Snowden, in the centre of public attention and the target of bite criticism.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency has encouraged earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profit has fallen due to a decrease in supply and orders
The Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains Bombardier reported a 15-procent decline in net profit on Thursday, resulting in a smaller number of orders and shipments of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier has also not published any data on the air test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered the current information as to whether this aircraft will comply with the ambitious plan to launch commercial operation from next September.
After starting the test flight, about a month and a half a plane flew three times ago and there was a question of whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not fill the estimates and the stocks in Toronto decreased by 8 percent.
The Cameron Doerksen State Bank Analyst has reduced the rating on Thursday from “higher profitability” to “sector performance” with the expectation that the storm will experience a limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"When we expected smaller shipments of aircraft, the profit margin in the area of transport has significantly disappointed us," said Doerksen in the client report.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will get new orders of CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are notified in the coming months, we assume that the market sceptics will increase to this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft are fighting to the bottom of the market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was revealed in March and after a few months delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders of CSeries aircraft reaches modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to be able to verify the company's claims on low consumption and cost savings of this aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected to reach Bombardier's target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Heads of staff also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was progressing according to the plan.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in the conference call and noted that the surveys on the ground and the software updates were scheduled during the departure of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
That's what's going to happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other shortly after.
However, analysts are sceptic to the fact that the first customer could start operating the CSeries plane 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it has evaluated its plan for placing the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the following months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although it is in line with the internal plan of Bombardier – apparently strengthens our view that the entry into service will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
Of USD 172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, in the third quarter ending September, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted returns on one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover marginally decreased from USD 4.5 billion to USD 4.5.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, the analyst of Thomson Reuters was expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that only 45 aircraft had been added in the quarter of the year before 57 aircraft.
Pure orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unconceived contracts in the air division consisted of 32.9 billion on 30 September, which does not change even on 31 December.
“The results in aviation were in line with our views, but the low income of orders and the overall state of the market has failed us,” Beaudoin said.
The cost in the air industry decreased by 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, said that the return in this division increased by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Uncontained transport contracts were 32.6 billion on 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
The Heads of Staff said that new views will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of the financial manager of Google Patrick Pichette, decreased by 8.5 percent during the trading on Thursday afternoon to USD 4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced a quarterly decline on Thursday.
A cocaine lawyer who warned the mafia before the police investigation is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to give information to the king underworld to Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years of prison.
A spiestor who informed the drug mafia about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had been suspected of the use of cocaine, the head of the underworld of Neil Scarbrough to provide sensitive information on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best legal representative, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough.
The police saw Sarborough (32), as he left at the lawyer's house in Blackburn in Lancashire, which was just for dinner with his colleagues from the law firm, three bags of cocaine.
Based on the tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallets and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of class A.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to repaidly obtain information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were monitored at that time in a major investigation of heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police arrested heroin and cocaine of about GBP 1.5 million in cash during a series of attractions, with GBP 200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison.
Ditta (42) gave information to criminals of fear that he would come to his dependence on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors' law firm located in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment from the liverpool Crown Court when he was found to be guilty of the fact that in two cases he was defending justice.
During the previous hearing, he confessed to holding cocaine.
The lawyers had fallen after the police investigation of Scarborough found out he was in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two suspect detectives followed him, recorded his arrival in Ditt's house, and they saw him planting drugs of purity 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Then Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium at Ewood Park, in regular phone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between both people.
The court said that there were traces of Class A in his hair, his wallets and his credit cards and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but the use of cocaine denied, and said he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation was "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a few credit cards from it, but they were all arrested, and his hair samples were taken from him.
During the police hearing, he said that he was running an office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that he was visited by clients for work.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests he contacted significant players in the drug supply chain, some of which previously represented to tell them what detectives know about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: “Whoever else is aware that he must not violate the law than the legal attorney in the criminal area.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the ordinary relationship of the lawyer-client.
The police investigation was dreaming as much as he could to allow them to continue their crimes.
Mr. Ditta did not bring his profession a good reputation, but he dishonored it.
He was too close to some of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be disturbed.
Ditta refused the offence and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to pass the information to Mr Scarborough, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal criminal himself when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leaders of the groups of organised crime that gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal representatives must follow the highest principles of integrity and have confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession's cloak.
The unit for serious and organised crimes in Lancashire led an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cases of cocaine holding and now for preventing justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the criminals to court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is out of reach of the law.
We'll find you and build you in court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he was declared guilty of the association for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and hemp.
The next thirty-five persons involved in the trade were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta arranged an online interview in which he said that his dream job would legally represent clients from a block of death in America, as a guest at dinner, he would wish Mohammed Ali and as motivation for work, he would say inequality.
He was negotiating the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now, the people of Jan Kasal sent against Babish.
Humans have won 14 Members in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of social democrats or representatives of the ANO.
But at least they enter the government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun arguing the outlines of possible coalition, John Kasal - a man who has regarded the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrei Babiš don't have such a matador on their side.
This time it will be reminded of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"experiences were at that time minimal," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will be developed.
Kenyan press disrupted by a controversial media law
"It is a scary report, and it is in place to ask what Parliament will prevent Parliament from simply diminishing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspapers considering the proposal of the law as counter-constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of the Capital Group, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be preconnected because it is a prolonged hand of the government” and that the restrictions on content and advertising will damage Keni’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will hear us out, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star Journal, the proposal of the law to the government actually passes over “the complete control of the media” and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya“ has suffered a hard wound,” and criticize the proposal of the law as “strengthful”.
Approval of the draft law comes in the middle of a series of measures to strengthen national security immediately after the Islamic shooter attack at the Westgate shopping center.
The firefighting authorities turned the Kenya media on themselves when she broadcasted the security footage on which the soldiers had allegedly raided the trade in luxury goods at the scene of the attack.
The Police Director responded by allowing two journalists and a media officer to interrogate, but the call was later withdrawn after the pressure of the media.
According to the new draft law, up to 20 million Kenyan Shields and individual journalists can be penalised by up to one million, together with the risk of "discretion from the list" or may be denied by official journalistic accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also one fine enough to destroy most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation impact on what the Kenyan blogosphere is called.
The politicians know that if they shut down the media, they can do whatever they want unrestfully.
"You don't know what can happen," wrote the newspaper Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described Kenyan media as the key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it on politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya were in the past targeted by the public critics.
In May, they voted for the abolition of cuts by the national pay agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries around 532,000 undeclared shillings monthly, which are the highest in the world.
They have to share, they know the young Czechs.
Most of them don't even know what interest
Still more Bohemians take their money away.
However, they do not reach champions in the savings of the region.
The biggest part of the money is being paid by the Austrians, who will burn annually on average EUR 181.
A little more than the Czechs will also support people in Slovakia.
It comes from an exploration of Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the creators is improving, and two-thirds of the questions are planning to spend more money on the side.
While the Czechs are about in the middle of the ladders of the stubborns, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little saving products.
For example, almost every other Serb will burn himself at home under the pillow.
In the country this year, a number of those who have paid higher amounts has risen.
Last year, the most different kind of savings were thousands to 2.5,000 crowns of 26 percent of respondents, this year is five percent more.
The average monthly contribution in the annual comparison decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit between savings products is retirement.
This prefers 54% of Bohemia, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess savings for only 36% of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings falls down, and, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has fallen considerably.
They're only using 16 percent of the respondents last year, while it was almost a quarter of people.
The survey also showed that although people consider important savings, most of them do not know what revenue they have on each product.
First of all, young people under 30 years don't know how charming their money is.
On the contrary, the best knowledge of the profitability of its money stored has the oldest group of questions, among people over 50 years, it knows 73 percent of the questions.
In the international comparison of the Erste Czechs leads to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovers and the Austrians with a 12% distance.
The UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations begins to work immediately on a new set of targets that replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which have been established 12 years ago in order to deal with global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Summit on Summit on Summit on Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Riu de Janeir, Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the "sustainable Development Goals" to replace MDGs, whose validity expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by the world leader, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The UN Secretary-General Mr Ki-mun at the Summit said that it is now time to ‘ rise above national interests’.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," said.
The SDG will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development programme after 2015.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our vision on the objectives of sustainable development which builds on the success of the MDG.
The fears of Mozambique's security are based on the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the Mosambian President of the founder, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa to call peace passwords on rare public demonstrations.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
From the fear of the future of her country, the business garments for a shirt decorated with the word “we require security” in Portuguese and joined on Thursday to the crowd on the Square of Independence in the capital.
For two weeks, reports of conflicts between government forces and the side of Renamo were almost daily, about one of the worst fights from peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an unfair rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa in an attempt to destabilize the independent government of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, the opposition party became.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict should be reinvested in the country, but recent events infringe foreign investors and locals.
There is a rapidly growing economy at stake because the discoveries of large coastal reserves of oil and coal beds in the northwest can be brought by companies such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and American Anadarko, investment worth more than 50 billion dollars in the next few years.
The Frelimo Government Party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are accusing each other of the tension.
Page Renamo claims that the government has triggered the last conflicts by attacking their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional swamp of the Renamo Party on 17 September.
The violent assault of the former rebels then culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times spokesmen of the Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government accuses Renamo for the start of conflicts because it said it attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to mitigate the fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza for the French press office of the AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "destroyer" who wanted to use "whatever of his power remained to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government."
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
But the fears rose when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted, that Renamo's party departed from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT said that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our goal is to go back to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mazanga.
Previous conversations between these parties have made just a little bit to mitigate the tensions between these parties, fragmented by a number of ties this year.
It is a charm between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator and neither one is ready to make the necessary withdrawals.
The Renamo Party, which has sought to change the election, has already expressed its intention to combat the municipal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort of competing movement to gain advantage from the government and financial benefits.
Renamo’s election share has been reduced since 1992, while the newer party, the Mosambic Democratic Movement (DHM), which was established by the former member of Renamo, will improve its position in elections, as expected.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, whose next year ends the second term of office, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He does not want a democratic system of more parties, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because he does not want to let the Presidential Office go," said Mazanga.
It's unclear what the Renamo Party's options have, but he's done a rigorous terrorist attack on the police station and on vehicles on the key road between severe and south.
Most of the fights occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on their exports of coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to say whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that the situation in Mosambique is not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development pace and recent flooding of kidnapping.
"People think that the country's responsibility is solely the government and the president and that he is to be the one who finds the solution to the problems," he says.
The demonstrant of Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for life,” says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that “the thick power cannot be equal to smart guilty, ” while artuish legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of myth would “for school teaching was too wild, too skandal, and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who would appeal for careful selection of works of the age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been throwing this plan for 20 years.
He added that the “open-up teaching” authors and teachers are on an intriguing story with a “subpage” message for children as a“ switch.”
Crossley-Holland, who translated epos Beowulf and also writes the Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Bearings, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them for yourself.”
Probably the biggest difference between an adult writer for adults and adult writers for children is a need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with a happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it's better to show than to describe.
Brno Starshop takes visitors to space in a new digitaria
At first sight, it is obvious that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There's a new stage, visitors can hit the new comfortable seats and over their heads there's a projection area with an average of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is his most important part, a new projector from Japan.
For the image to be perfect, there are other smaller projectors after the O.R.
Another important part of the entire device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate images," said the director of the Brno Starshop Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image of several projectors does not cover, but give a complete impression.
"The system of computers is 30 times to 40 times higher than with classic personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík.
The digitarian can exquisitely exquisitely realistic and plastically spell a model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The audience will be acetated right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The headquarters of the Starfleet plan to show in the O.R. purchased shows and its own creation.
Since Saturday, two shows are on the show.
The first is called Astronaut and intended for adults.
People will learn about the cosmonaut training in it, fly out into space, turn on a centrifuze, and then see the difficult conditions of astronauts in space.
The second show is for children and it has the name The Magic Aclim - Kaluoka'hina.
He tells the story of a cliff whose pesticide residents lived a peaceful life until the explosion of the nearby volcano.
The whole digitary cost about 50 million crowns, which mainly paid the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the star's budget also contributed to the smaller amounts.
Projection area cost ten million crowns, projector 12 million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual techniques and computers," explained Dušek.
The installation of digitarium followed after the reconstruction of the entire building that the starship passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've been producing 11 SECOND INZERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 advertisers offering a job, of which 4300 were published in daily printing and 6,800 advertisers (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet therefore becomes the most important medium for the publication of employment offers.
In 2005, when the survey first took place, his share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), around 60 percent were fixed.
Advertising work opportunities in itself according to the analysis considerably reflects the current situation on the labour market.
For example, a simple comparison of the number of public advertisers in the economic prosperity period and at the time of the economic crisis can be made.
For example, almost 25 900 advertisers were published in 2007 in the same period, and in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of positions on the Internet is oriented on a closer, particularly a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including the workers, stated by the author of the analysis of Pavlína Šťastnová.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, the leading advertisers were involved in looking for managers and managers, business representative, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small enterprises was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, the large representations are especially service and working professions.
Of course, the most frequently stated requirements that employers express through an advertisement offer include education.
The knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English, belonged to the other perceived area.
In the daily press, the request for knowledge of the foreign language was given in three percent of the advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only two percent of employers' advertisements demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The interest in "computer gramotivity" occurred in 40 percent of the advertisements (in daily printing at 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
The practice in the field was requested in 54 percent of the advertisements.
Practice requirements are linked to the village with qualified professions.
In particular, it is the manager of production and other managers.
In particular, for working professions, it is mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or electrical equipment repairers, the author completed the study by Jiří Tillner.
Employers also in half of their advertisements provide requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential tenderers.
As the most often required skill, the first advertisement has already appeared in communication skills for a long time.
Employers also require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that the city of New York is a place where solo comic performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, a varietal artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the jokes by the method of the interview.
Fay’s innovation spread over the years, most recent through the New York comedy festival.
The festival based and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too big to play in the club,” said Hirsch.
We have created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes" (stand up for heroes), the annual musical comedyal award in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby performs in addition to others.
Just as this festival expanded, the world of comedy spread.
Several comics attending this year's festival came from untraditional channels such as show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has climbed up with his sitcom (a pike "League" on a fantastic-fotbal theme on FXX) and now has its own comedy show at Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slateová was a member of both the "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but was most famous for the fast spreading series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on" (musi Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comets with clearly recognized voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, gentle, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will speak with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comic book, but he became a successful TV and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 he organized a TV Land show at the station called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in Town Hall, downtown of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's whole work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, he's going through an alley between two buildings sometimes, and he's like, man, if I lose all the money, I might live here.
The price of oil fell further into $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decrease on Friday, as high stock concerns balanced the report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese lation industry after energy.
The US oil indicator for December's deliveries during the late morning fell in the European electronic trade in the New York Trade Exchange by 14 cents per $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents and for the month October fell by 5.8 percent.
The rich oil supplies in the last few weeks have burdened the price.
The Ministry of Energy on Wednesday declared that the US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production came to a more demand that showed growth in activity.
This suggests that the economic recovery of China could continue to strengthen after the growth of the previous two weak decades in the third quarter of 7.8 percent.
Oil Brent, an indicator for international oil used by American refinery, fell 26 cents per 108.58 dollars per barrel at the International Trade Exchange in London.
Oh, no, Mr. Hask.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that they don't like this.
Such pressure is needed to ensure that Martin Hašek is disposed of all political functions and leaves the Member State's mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so misleading.
Martin Hašek is a promise that he made, but everyone and politicians must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politicians have (Mr. Babish also has the material, but it is the question, if they are politicians).
The best program prosecuted by a liar is incredibly untrusted.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he's distant in politics.
Mr. Haška, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, if you didn't just lie - here you see how difficult it is with lying), you'll leave politics alone as a man.
Then people accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and bears responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a backless weakness, whose words or acts cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, be a mistaken person or a lifetime sketch.
It may seem unfair to you when I speak only to you, but you are the leader, and they are just misleading sheep.
And you're the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to slip your ears for a while, regroup the forces, sit down the shame, and then attack again, but that's how the partisans or scavengers act.
You're, I repeat, in my eyes, the leader, the alpha male, so act.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court has blocked the regulation on the procedure for stopping and searching by the police department in NY
The Federal Court of Appeal, on Thursday, has blocked a court order requiring changes to the stop and search of persons at the New York Police Department and the Judge from the case.
The second American appealing federal court said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision will be postponed until the decision to appeal to the city.
The judge in August decided that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of stopping and asking people.
The city had concluded its conclusions and its corrective regulation, including a decision to assign surveillance to the police department, which would help to change its procedures and its training programme linked to them.
The Board of Appeal heard on Tuesday arguments for the delay requested.
The Court of Appeal said that the Judge must be dismissed from the case because it had reached a conflict with the rules of conduct for the Judge, by not acting as a judge in accordance with the requirement of avoiding the imprisonment, partly due to a series of media interviews and a public statement that openedly responded to the critique of the court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they were unjust focused on blacks and Hispanics under their programme of detention and search.
It has established an independent supervision to supervise the main changes, including the reform in the procedures, training and surveillance, and to order the launch of a pilot programme to test the cameras carried on the body in certain areas where the most frequent stops are occurring.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the preservation method of the names and address of the people whose cases were rejected after the police search.
Oral justification for the appeal of the city is planned sometimes after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching of persons criticized many civil rights defenders.
In some form there is a stop and search of persons for some decades, but recorded tours under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases they were blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men who are all among minorities were written in the case of a group prosecution.
The representatives of the changes in the programme of the stop and search of persons carried out by the police department in NY claim that the changes will end unfair practices, will increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police department and may affect how these procedures use other police departments.
The opposers claim that the changes will reduce the police's morality, but not crime, and that the money will be wasted, but it will not solve a wider problem when the police congregation is under pressure after the last decade his numbers decreased by a few thousand people.
The Judge noted that it did not end the practice of stopping and searching for persons who were constitutional but reformed the way the police department's search took place in NY.
Five shopping centers face low visitors
It is based on the data of the real estate consultants of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Bohnice, the Krakov Trade Center opens publicly, will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
In the Czech Republic there are now 90 major business centres.
The unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 percent of medium and large centres.
The main problems are an insufficiently large centre towards the location and bad layouts, i.e. too much pater or complicated and unstable arrangement of the passage, possibly dead centres," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also according to the head of the retail department, Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi is dealing with about five commercial centres with low visitors.
The main reasons include misunderstanding of transport, low income category of local residents or market residency at the location.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at the beginning.
Today customers are quite conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new business centres must try more to attract their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupancy of the shopping centres according to Soták is generally stable, even at some centres, because renters were willing to retaliate from rent and hire some units.
"But it is true that some projects have recently been opened, which are not fully occupied and the average obsession thus decreased (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantov in Olomouc)," said Soták.
Business centres opened in the last two years are very slowly promoted on the market by Sylvie Samadi.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of seats suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a project building area that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly a market space for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on purchases and daily needs for the population living in the immediate area," said Samadi.
According to Sotaka, there is also a place for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or enlargement in regional cities.
"City such as Kladno, Český Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have a space for further growth," said Soták.
In Prague, it sees the space for the prepared business centre on the Wine Square, and also has clear potential on the streets of Příkopy and Václav Square.
"Intensively expands the expansion of retail parks that enable traders to cover and extend to still smaller cities for favourable rental and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or local shopping centres, according to their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of the Prior business homes, which benefit from a good location," Dita Kubánková added from DTZ.
In the Czech Republic, 90 modern shopping centres are currently located with a total of more than 2,2 million square meters of gross rentable areas.
The quarter of all these shopping centers is located in Prague.
Between 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, results from the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is under the EU average, compared to the UK values and France, the Czech Republic is about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked his phone to check his tip.
The former editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods “hake on the phone, tracking and confrontation” to confirm the fraudulent tip on the love relationship that was supposed to be involved in the past Minister of Interior Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis at Old Bailey's trial said that News of the World was caught by false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his “attractive special counselling” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspapers entrusted a private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but in court it said that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The State Representative suggests that Mr Coulson, now editor of NotW, is not a man who stands outside the house and hopes that people are caught outside, but a person who likes to move stories to people to see what they say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspaper NotW used three ways to explore stories: crashing on the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, watching, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about crashing on the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The facts about the love relationship that Clarke was involved were first caught by the NotW News Department, when the source that was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was said: “You're just losing time, it's with Charles.”
The report with voice reports received from her phone at least three occasions was obtained in Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about Pawlby said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the former rapporteur, Neville Thurlbeck, and former rapporteur, James Weatherup, were watching Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice report in which he told her: “I got a story that we're about to spend tomorrow, and I would love to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was according to the same model as for other important personalities, among which former Minister of Interior David Blunkett belongs.
On Thursday, the court said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love relationship with a married woman, while he himself saw Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks denied the association with other persons in order to hack into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to crashing on the phone.
Discovery of NSA increases social paranoia of surveillance by the State
One day, at the end of August, the German police helicopter banged over the American consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the basis of the guidelines of the Joint Committee on Constitution Protection (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agencies, the purpose of the mission was to provide photographs of the roof of the US predecessed patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbanks.
The German media claimed that BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered the exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, the American Director of National Reporting, again in September, insisted that the United States did not use their foreign intelligence options, “to steal foreign companies' business secrets for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began to reveal his valuable collection from secret monitoring by the United States, the European government and the leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they're supposed to believe the words of the director.
Following reports that the American National Security Agency was spying in the Brazilian oil company and gained access to data with which American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have reached general paranoia on State monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came to reveal that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was being listened for, like, ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly potential targets and leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has reviewed intense cooperation between American intelligence services and companies.
I'd say it's possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to the survey published in July by the EY consultancy service, the German companies believe that as regards industrial spying and data stealing, the US now presents the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in all the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden so far that the United States has passed trade secrets to foreign companies by their own companies.
Politicians expressed their concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet skills and said that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US:
Prime entrepreneurs are sceptic to that.
From the German Parliament, the votes are that we should make German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, the chairman of the SAP German Software Company.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical processing of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden are for some companies who have so far thought that China is the biggest threat to surveillance, yet shocking.
There is a large turnover in cloud computing technology, where European leaders in a wider range realized that the data stored in the US fall under its jurisdiction and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to the survey carried out by the Cloud security community, about 10 percent of non-American members after the detection of the US Prism subsidiary programme, the plans to use a cloud provider based in the US.
Jim Snabe, one of the SAP Directors-General, says: “Do we have a new question for customers who have not been here a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German seniors argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to separate their most valuable secrets and that data must be protected at all costs.
That an economic spy is not a surprise.
It's always been done.
“It is a key topic for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the BASF agrochemical company.
Americans are spying on us at a business and industrial level, just like we are doing spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast with anti-measures that they have done so that they do not provide a benefit to the attacker.
In the case of large companies, it has been recalled for a long time that to take a free storage USB drive at the fair or to keep an unprotected notebook in the hotel room is at least incomprehensible.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a car manager of the Audi, says that for many years it is a common practice to collect before the appointment of the mobile phone board so that it is not possible to use them as a listening device.
The German Office of BfV advises staff managers to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smart phones can be disbelieved.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be fired.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are faced by the global market leaders in their specific areas.
"Mal and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised approach," warns in its BfV report.
The US warns its own company against economic spys from other countries.
According to the Washington post of the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, in February France, next to Russia and Israel, in the second row of the perpetrators involved in the hacker's business for the economic rapporteurs, immediately behind China.
A member of the board in the German risk society concluded that, as regards economic spy, “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “The services are well aware that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a minor boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believes he was murdered
Parents of a minor boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a spoiled fighter spirit in his high school gym, believes their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found caved on 11 January in a parade spiritually behind tribunami in the gym where he went.
The Sheriff's investigators at Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the family of the 17-year-old youth refuses it.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said for FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kennetha and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this is opposing logic, physical laws, and also sound,” Crump said.
They think it's supposed to be a secret about what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he went back to their body bags," he said.
Deputy Attorney Michael Moore said that he was conducting a routine investigation of Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll watch the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for the current investigation," he said.
Moore told the journalists that the original autopsy suggested that Johnson died as a result of the “postage afflict”.
According to Moore, the second autopsy stated another cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if Johnson's death reveals enough evidence for a criminal investigation or a violation of civil rights, the FBI will ask and implement it.
Deputy Sheriff's Office from Lowndes County was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
Judge of South Georgia on Wednesdays ordered the authorities to provide all videos from the surveillance cameras the investigators checked.
Youth parents hope that video records will contain a trace leading to the discovery of their son's death.
CDC Center issued a directive for schools on allergy in children
At the center of the Centre for Prevention and Disease Control (CDC) issued a set of directives to help in the case of children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of directives that the U.S. government has issued, because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The CDC found that the incidence of allergy to food in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directives contain information for schools on how to inform the teachers and staff of children's allergies on food and how to respond to allergic reactions if there is.
The schools also recommend that adrenaline is available – most often used by an automatic EpiPen intake – to respond to potentially dangerous hypersensitivity.
The state law enforcement authorities have recently updated the rules that enable schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone fucked me in the tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "I can hear my tongue."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “undetermined sex”
Germany has become the first European nation that recognises the third gender in children born with unambiguous sex regimens.
Newborn children will no longer be ranked only with male or female sex.
The new law from parents does not require that they introduce any sex for such children, and enables them to indicate sex on their birth leaves as "undetermined" or "unspecified".
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to rushly decide for their child for a sex-determination operation and combating discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One intersexual person according to BBC after many years said: “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'm going to stay a salad formed by a doctor, bruised and scary.
It is estimated that 2000 children are born one that is neither a boy nor a girl every year.
They are intersexual, part of the group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorder, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
The determination of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to identify them instead of waiting and watching the child’s psychological and physical development until the operation is performed, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determination problems, said that the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but not for most children,” he said.
The identification of the sex can be performed without surgery and then it can wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of the child’s sexuality is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not bound to sex, but to their biological construction, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These features may appear in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and character, in primary sexual characteristic such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersexual and trans-sexual people in the field of work, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
The boys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowed to mark adults in official documents of male, female or third sex.
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australanka, became the first recognized “resolute” in June worldwide when she won a court appeal to keep the status of “undetermined” sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports will have, except for M (man) and F (woman) and third markings, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, according to the news report on France 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strong Catholic country signed a petition for removing the "sex theory".
The American Catholic website also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With how the world is dragged to a new state where sex is a matter of choice, but not sexual activity, we will turn two other pillars of civilization.”
One newborn mother from Maryland also said for Baby zone that she would rather see the children to share sex at birth.
“The family itself is stressful without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” expressed itself for the parental care website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children with both male and female sex called hermafrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could delete and recast.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that sexual jurisdiction is complex matters, and doctors may sometimes decide wrongly because they do not know how they feel about their sex when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century it was called psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Persistent theory of treating children with unambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who considered sex to be subject.
He created a new term of "family nationality" and argued that the social causes and effects of the environment – as parents raised – resulted in children's genes and hormones and formed a child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theory became disputed.
The parents of the boys whose penis was damaged because of the wrong circumcision, he recommended that their child be completely castrated, removed his testicles, and raised him as a girl.
"Média presented this case as a successful change case, but the fact was different," Drescher said.
When the boys were 15 years old, he got re-opted back on a boy and married to a woman.
But in 38 years, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared “satisfactory with the result”.
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but unambiguous sexual system.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a big clit, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life”.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
He got women's hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
In 18 he was sent to a vagina plastic.
But because he was depressed and he knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After I was born, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with gender development disorder (DSD) which prevented the body from producing sufficient amount of testosterone so that his sexual system could be developed correctly.
After he found out the truth, he turned back to men, took the doses of testosterone and had his breast removed,
Operations caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in the organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director of the Law Group Advocates for an informed choice (an informal voters) with its registered office in California, fears that the German law is ‘invited to scissors and stigmats’.
“ Many activists are concerned that the German law will achieve encouragement by parents to make quick decisions and choose “undeterminated” for the child,” said.
We're afraid it'll induce intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will eventually sound, so all we can do is speculation.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be classified in third sex.”
"Adolescents should be able to make their own decision on a legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not seduce at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own choices about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiator from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law will "shall powers" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but he has a DSD syndrome of insensitive androgens.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, they developed with Katie's female features.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have uterus and ovaries.
Now, the 29-year-old Katie is married, and as part of the studies at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern in child psychiatry.
Although it is fertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
“The law will give parents some space to avoid rushing with their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to carry out some tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman".
Everything is fine in this regard – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful baby and you're enjoying it.
You don't have to rush with an operation that's irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to engage in decision-making as well as the child and takes away the anxiety that parents bind, because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Eventually, the child decides to what sex it is more identifiable – and that is a great thing.
It gives the children the power to make their own decisions.
The monkey poured the whole house with gas: He threatened to burn it even with his own family!
The tension has risen, fear has risen.
A man started to threaten to burn the whole house.
That is why all available police patrols in the area have gone out as well as a firefighters unit from Young Boleslav and a team of volunteer firefighters.
There's also a police negotiator who men tried to excuse his irrational behavior.
A man still threatened to burn the house.
So an intervention unit must have entered the house that damaged men and tied them.
And then Agresor ended up exploring at the Mladeoleslav hospital, from where he was transported to an antialcoholic seizure station.
The firefighters finally covered the gas house with a sorbent, which later cleaned up.
In addition, all pets were also rescued from the house.
A man didn't go to a police negotiator, and he went to a commando.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to replace Bidena as Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser according to the New York Times secretly considered to replace the 2012 Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most important sensational anticipating book of campaign 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times magazine received a copy of the coming book and announced on Thursday evening that President's top collaborators organized intense group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to estimate whether the removal of Biden would help to revive Obam's palling hope of re-election.
According to a national-political correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of officials in the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House Head of Bill Daley, to measure the effect of the elections to move the former Minister of Foreign Clinton to the vice-president.
Potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only some of the nearest presidents – including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign by Jim Messina and former chief advisers in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book “Double down” claims that Daley was the representative of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to do this move when the data showed that the addition of Clinton to the candidate would not have significantly increased.
In interview with Martin Daley, the administration really considered the replacement of Biden Clinton.
"I intensely examined a number of things, and this was one of them," commented for the letter Daley.
You must not forget that at that time the president had a terrible prospect, so we were like, "Goddamn, what should we do?"
While Daley characterized research as “relevant care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign for re-election had made a small investment to find out whether the move in the elections would be paid.
“In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and qualitative research, unless something is seriously considered,” said Martin at AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin said for CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about this potential card mixing.
While Daley said that he didn't think that the president had been aware of the potential changes, former head of the office admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Double down” definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe came to Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about a research on Biden's withdrawal from the candidate.
"Maybe," said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using honey.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this sea animal and developed the luminous luminous palms.
He came to the idea when he reads the expert mediocratic discussions, and convinced the scientist in China to produce a chemically protein that causes lightning.
This ice cream reacts with the insulin language – increases the level of pH in the protein and subsequently causes radiation.
Chris says the ice cream is lighting when it reacts with your mouth warming, and that's why the more you lick, the brighter the glow.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (lick me, I taste great), says: "It's a wonderful substance, but as far as it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so you'll get about 2 g of this substance for 200."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up protein, the pH levels increase, and the ice cream begins to shine.
We've tested it in the last few months and seems to be a great idea for Halloween celebration because it causes this fantastic bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lightning of honey is four times more expensive than gold.
And so I'm about 140 GBP worth every kick.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company located in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavor of beer, cheese, beef and gold tickets.
His next product is to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible for the ice crystal light that makes it, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of honey, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could have eaten candy, stay up long and show the neighbors in a disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a reptile.
For two years, there's been no candy in my apartment, and this year's probably not gonna be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, black sheep.
According to the U.S. retail federation (NRF) this year, the majority of Americans will celebrate Halloween – in fact, 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion is expected to be $1.2 billion for costumes.
This year they're the last fashion shot of sexy distant objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect you to see a lot of zombies by the parade of the dead, and I'll bet the spacemen from Daft Punk will reach our channels in Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most wanted zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches are.
I assume there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year, we put our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones in my amazement.
In fact, the Americans according to the NRF will spend $330 million this year on animal lovers costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As for candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, the Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, licks, milk duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That's an amazing message for 41 million collaborators who, according to the U.S. Trade Department, are about to break into our quarter.
In fact, during Halloween we'll buy, and don't believe we'll even consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugarmen around Halloween, almost 16,000 tonnes will be sold.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never figured out.
There's nothing more typical than scary houses for Halloween.
They have the best names like "Terror behind the walls" (The Horse behind the walls, which, by the way, is a real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (scream, scream) and "The house of shock" (The House of shock).
In fact, there are, in the United States, the officially dedicated 1200 scary homes that according to the American scary houses have a profit of $500 million, and this includes the amazing photos of which you are pissed off and which your friend gives you on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will look at the photo and add a comment as "the face you look."
And in the end, a little bit of pumpkin.
Since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us a large pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin mirror is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since a little girl.
Fortunately for us, the trend “child in the pumpkin” started thanks to the Pinterest application only last year, so most of us grew up on the fact that we carved the cane instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People Counterfeiting Office, Americans spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin.
The pumpkin lamp with a migot flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where this year grew 245,000 tons of pumpkin.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from the town of Napa in California and try to cut their pumpkin weighing almost one ton.
Announced series of Land Rover racing
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
The choice is improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between the various races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants of the races coming to Bowler have changed.”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventures and also a way to race world class.
We are pleased that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that they will prepare for the competition for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
Developing Defender Challenge we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as an opportunity to compete in desert races in the north of Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have premature elections in two years.
Chairman TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections.
A week after the last interview for the Actual.cz said that there is no other exit, and each government came from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"He can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the period of life of the starting election period was estimated within two years.
With the objection that the voters next time hardly choose completely differently, they disagree: "I don't think it'll be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the Chairman TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters in other elections this year (as compared to 2010, she lost about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if the premature elections are clear within two months, it will strengthen the movement of Andrei Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
The turbulent situation in ČSSD, where the President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the Latin leadership of the party, declared that he or Michal Hašek, would remain in the management of social democracy, commented on Schwarzenberg:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party as little boys go behind the head of the state to allow them to turn on the side."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen anything so badly done in my life," the president added TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (to which he faced in the fight for the presidential function) he trapped: "The role of the heads of the state is clear: He wants to take the side."
The first laws have already tabled TOP 09.
What was the greatest surprise for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws, including the Faran Register of Contracts, which had been discussed by the House Committees before the elections, but with early elections, it fell under the table.
Chairman TOP 09 in the interview for Actual.cz claims that such a speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, the TOP 09 wants to clearly undermine similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the electoral leader of the movement ANO Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-electoral struggle of introducing a register of contracts "distorted" programme of movement ANO.
TOP 09 has now used the lead - just pushed out the proposal that had already entered the second reading of the House.
The fire departments came to save the lost puppies that got stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous outcast in the stoneloom.
Cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a little car accident.
Three days later, he was trapped in a stonelome, saw a man who walked the dog.
The firemen were baked on the rock wall to save the dog from certain deaths.
The puppies were released by fire units, which came to free him after it was somehow trapped itself on a dangerous outcast in a stoneloom of 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and three days he lived alone until he was released from stonelome on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) with their girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in a stoneloom Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue services from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, he was hot after his lost dog was searched and placed calls on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14:15, a bright-sighted doggy saw Ruby stuck on a stone-loom 15 meters above the ground.
To the place, the technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station has rushed down to free Ruby, using it to pick up the shipping bag for the animals.
The expert chief of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the back.
He wasn't moving his eyebrow – he was totally frozen.
But now he's okay.
He got some cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
Peter Lau, the expert chief of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had great luck during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a tour, and besides exhaustion and dehydration was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid of looking at a rescue event."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firemen have done a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them. They were all just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there.”
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says he definitely didn't leave after 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview for Australian radio show, this pop star this week said that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" from 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he went after her.
And she added: “It was a long time ago, and now he's very kind to me.”
In the statement from Thursday Jagger (70) the representative said that he categorically refuses to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said: “Maybe you mistake him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the guest singers (singers) who appeared this year on the Rolling Stones concert line.
Her new album "Prism" debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: Split Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, it appears that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This led to stories of passport controls in Berwick and stained wire along Hadrián's Valle.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as it could be expected – that was not reflected in the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do so.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of continuing dishonor would be a cheap retreat for Brussels for whatever they really want from Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that he became a dump, a newspaper duck, that “independent means passport control,” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, in this bearded story there is one interesting idea.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why replace London for the brussels, especially now?
This is a true European story: a great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The euro crisis is officially dead by the European Project.
Throughout Europe, the parties have the effect of consecrated resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, an alternative to Germany – founded in this year – came out of nowhere and already received almost five million votes in the light of the federal elections, thus, from the Bundestagu, essentially, "made out" of the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
At home, there was always opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
Consistency dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the scrutiny of the national economy, led many people to the view that Europe’s project went too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments operate with a high budget deficit – that was only true in Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members on exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that's what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluating domestic currencies, South Europe has a disadvantage against Germany.
The only help is to cut out revenue and public expenditure – to what Germany urges.
A deeper cause of European small performance is behind the current budgetary and currency problems.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – the code for supporting French and German companies for consumer costs – the European industry applies twice as much as electricity and four times more for gasoline than in the United States.
This is a paralysing disadvantages in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even the freezing of wages in the world would not reverse the salary of the European petrochemical industry with a cheap sculpture oil from the US.
The result is a stunning rebellion, especially in France, once enthusiastic EU leaders.
After the war, political elite in France has seen the EU as a tool that will keep Germany in line and allow Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, already needs to be a political legitimacy card and has sold its own economic policy in Europe and has left its destiny to the consumed French economy.
Result: The true wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won the major additional elections and has removed the governmental socialists to the third place.
The Front is now with 24% of the most popular party in France – the early warning to British workers that they cannot judge that the right grafting will automatically show on the left.
How does Le Pen charge its newly acquired popularity among the white-working class?
The European election next year would like to use it to create an anti-European block against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block may dominate for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
In my opinion, at the earliest time, the increasing anti-European feelings and attitudes against the common currency will be joined and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn to something more loose in the sense of “Europe (Suvereen) nations” already preferred General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and South Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distanc from this project and close to the United States.
However, the increased interest in Washington on the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left for atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a area (in principle) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – there is also a possibility to announce Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I assume that Scotland would have done well in a relaxed European arrangement provided that it would retain its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thought countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The government of the SNP in Scotland is – amazingly – the most successful political movement that does not promote austerity measures in Europe, which has won a great majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition attitude towards cuts planned (and implemented) by the labourist Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Adults Previously
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white layers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind this.
Experts say one of the triggers of the former puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
Early teenage trend isn't so obvious for boys.
Former rapporteur CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in the health of children and family problems.
Should her mother be scared when her daughter starts to grow breasts and get cold on the pagans in seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors this week in Orlando in Florida explained the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time making sure my parents aren't usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, irritation and underpants and body smell, appear early in girls.
In the past 40 years, however, there was only a small change in the age of first menstruation.
In the United States, the average age of 12,5 years is now 12,75 years old in 1970.
"When breasts begin to evolve, at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of puberty going on is time.
It is discussed what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth puppy 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be “prematurely advanced”.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which may be carefully monitored by paediatric physicians.
Faster growth can be a reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to a halt of growth and adulthood.
The recommendations for medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of a child, development rates, growth rates and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
As far as medication is concerned, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he recognises that “the suppression of puberty can mitigate the problems with the behavior of a girl and its feelings that it differs from its peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are worried that he can get pregnant or how he can handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began having menstruation in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't prepared emotionally.
She came home scared and angry that she was her first friend.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature teenagers.
However, there is still no coherent set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys – like girls – they get puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001 he helped to perform a study on girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which combines body fat with puberty timing.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics have the tendency to reach puberty before their white-eyed counterparts.
Explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything possible from economic conditions through climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although, at low age, there is an irritation in the face and in the ohanbic, the trend towards the full blooming of early puberty is not as clear as it is with girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) conference added further complexity to this subject.
Acne and irritation of ohanbice is common even in infants and tomatoes.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the actual arrival of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrologist from the Goryebian child hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to obtain instructions from their paediatric physician how to speak to their child.
“It may mean the need to talk to the child before you assumed,” said Caplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
The girls that evolve earlier need assurance that even if so early, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of the pub.
Does he have a new job?
An actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the excavation in the role of the economy and was very good for her.
That a popular Czech actress would plan a change of profession and go to business in the pub?
Nadia Konvalinková appeared in the James Joyce Irland pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
The boss even offered to hire me, and I could live with beer spinning.
But I refused, I would rather stay at what I do today, at acting," she said with a smile Konvalinková, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the functioning of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have an Irish whiskey here," she said her tastes as an actress.
Nadi also showed up a long-term friend and colleague Pavel Nový.
I'm dead and I can't drink in the current new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to keep," the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers, for the width of the seats, are at stake large contracts
A dispute about the width of the seats in the second class of flights at a long distance between the heads of the aircraft producers, which in Dubai, this month, caused a bitter exchange of views on the air show.
The object of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for in the long-term flights for the economic class – not just the one that would normally precede the airline, but whose allocated space is the key to claims for efficiency for the recent aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus invited this week to industrial standards, which would offer at least 46 cm of wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they have to decide the airline.
The Spor emerged at the time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-motor remote aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear part of the aircraft is distributed – especially if there is 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of economic performance entitlements for the designs of new aircraft “mini-jumbo”.
Boeing says that the improved model “777X” will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread after 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its model A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
Giant aeroplanes often face each other in technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to gain a superiority with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when the financers showed a picture of three people sealed in a restaurant with a title “Do you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats more than in regional turbovrtule aircraft," said Airbus John Leahy.
As food meals change, people are bigger, but the seats in the planes have not radically changed.
From the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern air transport to the turn of the century, the average American mass increased by 10 percent according to the US Health Ministry data.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has 100 cm in passport.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seats from the '50s where the average width of seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus argues that she carried out a research suggesting that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing’s dimensions of Airbus’ seats reject and says that it is not in the power to decide how airline companies export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than on the width of the seat.
"The fact is, to provide airline companies with flexibility and to allow them to do things that they believe must do in order to succeed," said Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what brings profit to them.
They know their business better than anyone.
It is essential for passengers to be greater space for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
After this dispute, there is a race in orders of aircraft with estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to deteriorate US and European exports.
As Reuters stated in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing argue that their latest designs are 20 percent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment, model Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance claims of Boeing depend in part on the comparison of model 777X with 10 seats in a row and concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit cargo is weakened compared to the 10-seddline concept.
"The reason why Boeing does this is to push more seats and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, leading to the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabin with 10 seats in a row for existing models 777 are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a thicker layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Fourty-five centimeters of the wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view, Airbus is motivated by the threat of model 777," said the expert in the interior of the cabin Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer suppliers a catalogue to airline companies so that they can choose.
Travellers even carry a measuring zone with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While it is comforting, all manufacturers also offer airplanes with a highly dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but he says he hasn't sold it yet.
Donava Airbus emphasized the need for greater cabin adjustment by offering more wider seats in alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without supporting one further manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard but may deter from the 777X sales waves.
The number of HIV infecteds exceeded in Prague 1,000
In the Czech Republic, the number of infecteds is growing annually.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later were 121 and 180 in 2010.
Last year, they were infected with 212, and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, no longer doubts," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague Light House for patients for years.
According to him, from January to September, 165 HIV patients were in the country, this year 176.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number was 1005 in September.
There were 206 infected in the Middle Bohemian region.
The diagnosis also heard 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian and 116 from Ústecký.
The least infected were from the Highness, 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected in the past in blood transfusion.
However, since the beginning of the testing, in more than a quarter of a century, this case has not appeared in the Czech Republic.
With HIV, six children were also born, moved to them from their mother.
Nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but it's beautiful, says experts
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity was sold out in Czech cinema some time after the premiere.
According to the Union, almost 150,000 viewers saw him in October and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positive.
However, others find certain irregularities in it.
The Lidovky Server.cz asked experts from a series of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the movie.
Jiří Dušek (Stellar Manager and Planetarium Brno): I like scientific-fantastic films, which I consider to be modern dream fairy tales.
The film of Gravity does not remove even when faced as "physically real" performance.
It's not, but it doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, like, Sandry Bullock's hair, which doesn't seem to be in a state of trouble.
Hubb's cosmic telescope and the International Space Stations are moving after significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers are compelled by an unrealistic effect and in all fire behavior in the state of trouble.
According to them, the skafandry wouldn't hold such wounds as well.
Heroes in the Gravity film often get into collisions with various objects and suits without major difficulties, everything will last.
The critique has not been spared by the story.
Such extensive tragedy on the orbit of the Earth is unrealistic according to some discussions.
Plus, they wonder why the doctor was sent to space to correct the technique.
People fight in the forums also about "unreal" lan behavior.
She says she works like she's meant for the bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Stellar Manager and Planetarium hl.M. Prague): I have seen him on a wide screen, but I can clearly say, I have been enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but a science-fiction.
And for such a story, the author has the right (most duty) not to remain consistently reality.
"More than you mentioned irregularities, I was affected by the three times the space stations with degrading level of technology (the last Chinese) are shown."
"The Chinese will be better than he is in the movies by the end of the decade."
Vladimír Karas (register of the Astronomic Institute of Sciences Academy of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful not to break physical laws, and so the naturally-oriented viewer appreciates that during various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of momentum, said by the physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin slopes of the atmosphere and the polar radiation surrounding the field.
I'm sure inconsistencies will be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of different cosmic garbage on the orbit in some scenes appears to be reversed than it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (Employer of the Institute of Astronomic Sciences Academy of the Czech Republic): Some things have adapted to their needs, but none of the essential and to heaven calling sins against logic or natural laws, I have not recorded in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus is to see that the creators have taken care of the credibility of displayed events.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth appointing the fact that Hubbl's space telescope is circumcised in different orbits than ISS.
The result is a considerably different mutual speed and, therefore, rescue operations could not go through as shown in the film.
In addition, at the moment of the department of Kowalsky (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS would rot, so there is not even clear origin of the force of Kowalski, which force both players to release at the moment that they no longer move towards each other.
A new Nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from addiction to nicotine for life.
More tests are needed before human trials, which will take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Faculty of Health Weill Cornell in New York says the first signs are good.
"We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their addiction to the nicotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to create antinikotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which will then begin to create a smooth current of these antibodies.
Antibodies persecute all molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thereby preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine intervention.
In the test of vaccinated mouse, which was additionally supplied nicotine, they continued their routine activities.
But the mouse, which was not vaccinated, “have calmed down,” said researchers, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
Experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The past tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be administered so often to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies, so they appeared to be expensive and non-ractic.
Costs for new vaccines should be much lower because they convert liver cells into antibodies factorys.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could give up to the children before they want to try a cigarette, and it would avoid addiction to the nicotine.
But more likely, smokers would use it to stop.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not have any pleasure for the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this evil habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies that Obeid would affect him
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Supervisory Committee on Corruption.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the policy of the coastal lease at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three real estates on a controlled land government.
Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday extended its search for whether Mr Obeid was guilty of several ministers to be a rental on Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and cafes, renewed without having to participate in the selection procedure after his end in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about the undercover interests of Mr Obeid on these properties, on the basis of evidence presented on Thursday by the former Deputy Head of Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of interviews launched in 2005, the government pushed to go to public competitions.
The renters were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual conditions.
In 2009, rentals for Circular Quay companies, which Obeids brought $2.5 million per year, were restored without the need to participate in the public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the minister of ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a favourer of public competition.
However, he denied that the changes were made at Mr Obeid's request, which, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in governmental lease policy.
The translation of calls submitted in ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Obeide and Tripodim and Steve Dunn, the head of the official who came to the port office after he worked under Mr Obeide in the Fisheries Department.
"He was a subject of interviews during these telephone calls about the development of commercial rental policy?" asked the auxiliary Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," said Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but not this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israel’s military aeroplanes attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible activist
The Israeli military aeroplanes hit the target in the Syrian port of Lázikíja on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible administration of the Fox News station.
This responsible agent specifically did not say what target it was, but he said he was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the SA-125 missiles were targeted by Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel made an airborne attack on the shipments of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, Komentator Pečinka spoke so that he could agree with it, while the Chairman of Štěch was smothering.
Heytman Chovanec was a suspect as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
The chairman of the Saturday was always, and it is a symbol of the poverty of the ČSSD continues.
The other gentlemen have demonstrated their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is essential and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek has made most conversation on TV impossible.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than suggesting the Vice-President of the Senate of Gayd, the only one would not have the initial hendicap and I think it would do the standard performance.
It's such a good solution that only one of the leaders will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without breaking down the side.
Alena Gajdůšková could, without worry, build a minority government with only a blessing from the President of Babish and without humans, but with the human health minister of Hovor, who is a believer social democratic.
This mini-Menchine Government would have a great stability because it would promote the proper referendum law and have committed itself to support the President of the Okamura Úsvitu.
Prime Minister Babiš would eventually accept the progression of taxes, because he is smart and will see that it can't be done without it.
Humans wouldn't bring trouble, because Hovorka is the carrier of the best they have, and they wouldn't have been in the government otherwise.
The same applies to ANO, there would also be a valuable minister here, but if they reasonably do not want to enter a risky government participation, but will provide support, too well.
Let's give Alice the Gaydosh's courage!
Foreign visa professionals may undergo a "authority" test.
As the government intends to extend police action, the "authority" test for foreign workers with visa authorisation 457.
The test, if accepted, will apply the median criteria to prevent the 457 programme being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a rear door for the transfer of family and friends to Australia.
When the government's article was issued today, former labourist Ms Maxine McKew sentenced the government rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that it could be offended by Australian neighbours.
“Hlasite statements of “objectives at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remains from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market,” said today for the Australia-Indian Institute.
Historically it meant that the white workforce should be protected – and I wouldn't wonder if anyone in this region had recorded an echo of this historical artifact.
The article discusses 12 of the measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was last night at Sri Lanka, where he deals with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to consider.
Where the criteria of ‘authority’ are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘is the nomination authorised for the situation where the candidate is in relation or personally linked to the owner or the relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
Following previous experiences with businesses who intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employ hundreds of them, businesses may also require justification for the number of visa holders of 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who sought asylum, died with suspicion of a heart attack after this week arrived on the asylum ship on Christmas Islands.
The nine-year-old man traveled to Australia along with him and after his father's death on Wednesday he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities rushed to a hospital in Christmas islands where he died.
The British Government has notified a study aimed at increasing the advantages of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said that the project “toge together by the Great Britain.”
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was cooperating with the British Government on this "duty" plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which interviewed the National Transport Scotland Transport Office, empowered HS2 to find out further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect the Great Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that brings it is huge.
Without this, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a connection – through the Great Britain, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected by HS2.
The Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today the announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown, Mr. Carmichael, called for “such as” to support the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring Scotland inevitable economic advantages, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain.”
So we are thrilled to cooperate with the British Government to explore the possibilities to bring high-speed railways to Scotland and bring all the benefits and add the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government plans as well.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British Ministers next year and the joint decision on further steps.
Together with Barta, she arrested the inspection and analytics of the anti-corruption police
Information about the arrest of Víta Barty began spread on Thursday the evening when the message brought the server First-Spravy.cz.
MF DNES found out that the case was in charge of the General Security Board Inspection (GIBS), her people should have arrested Bart in the center of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection shall address cases where there are among the accused police, but its powers shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the anti-corruption police officers is the head of analyst and informative Jan Petržílek.
He used to work for Security Information Service in the past.
Jaroslav Ibehej, speaking countercorruption police, refused to comment on the fact that the media had to turn to the GIBS in this matter.
She also spokesman of Radka Sandor's inspection, but she didn't want to say anything about the case, with a turn to the City Attorney in Prague.
"This question will not be commented on the protection of classified facts," said DA Štěpánka Zenklová.
Also, this non-concrete reaction can be rejected that the event took place, but it is in a coverage regime that does not allow the spokesman to say anything specific.
In a similar situation there is also Bart's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba.
The media said that Bart is representing "and in this matter," but since it is classified information, Bart cannot confirm or reverse Bart's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest could be associated with former police president Petr Lessym.
They've been prosecuting Bart's office with former VV President Radk John, who was in charge of the Ministry of Interior.
The Spor, which had to deal with President Václav Klaus in the past, had to deal with the explosion between Peter Nečas and the VV.
I have no idea where this connection came from on my person.
Nobody contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about things," iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of the police.
He officially sold him to Radek John, the real head of the party, but that's when Barta was.
Barta has now been running for elections for the dawn movement, the missionary mandate has only escaped by 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura said that he has no idea what this is about.
"With Barta was one of many candidates at our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the dawn of direct democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced from Barty Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bart the opportunity to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the issue of the expeditors.
Welcome to Barta came to court in 2012 with his former colleague from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment in aeroplane will remain in Australia for the time being in force.
Travellers of Australian airline companies will need to continue to switch their tablets and smart phones while starting and landing, regardless of the changes in the US, in order to mitigate the rules on these facilities.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given US companies the space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the equipment stays in the "air" mode.
Travelers can already do this during a large part of the flight, but many people bother that they can't have access to their electronic books during the start and landing.
The Australian carriers shall examine this decision which requires a large piece of work from American carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that this notification was examined, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment at critical stages of the flight are still valid in Australia.
‘CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft,’ said.
This question is covered by the rules which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers are acting in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about the extension of the use of its boarding wi-fi, has been inclined, but has announced that it will be subject to the decision of the Regulatory Authority.
"We would welcome that the CASA would analyse the permission to use electronic equipment, because we really think that it would be now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment) to improve customer experience," said the speaker.
Qantas has announced that for now it will stick to current regulations.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during the take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
FAA rules apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful for our passengers, and we are sure to thoroughly study the FAA decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the legislation will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their air park.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft may tolerate radio disturbances of mobile phones, as well as to revise manuals, training material, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
‘As soon as the airline company confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones, at any altitude,’ said FAA.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the crew orders passengers to turn off during the landing of the device.
The group also recommended that the harder equipment be stored safely under the seats or in the storage area above the head during the take-off and exit.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, the pawnshops in Singapore are experiencing blooming
In the pawnshop at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the gold bracelet, ring and earring to pay her daughter to school.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money on it," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as administrator, she gets $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, her family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across the southeast Asian areas – where household debt is increasing – is indeed such that the ValueMax company, where the woman is conducting its transaction, has become at a stock exchange in Singapore the third lodging on the ladder.
The stopping of jewels is not just a fast way to lend cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsafe bank loans.
The stampers in Singapore normally apply a yearly percentage rate of 17 percent, just over 15.4% of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the stoppers have the advantage that they do not require the verification of the person (payment history) or the income document and may provide a loan faster than banks.
Therefore, as families feel pressure because of increasing living costs and increasing household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by cash policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-sized income return to the pawnshops to deal with a deteriorated financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to increasing rentals as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the ladder with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, which is an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
The economics also feared high levels of excise debt in Thailand, which just got out of technical recess this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weak export and a decrease in consumer demand.
"The important thing is that with increasing costs from middle to low [receivables] people will try to complete their income wherever they can," Song Seng Wun said, the economist in the Malaysian CIMB bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are moving to stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to change their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops form gold.
People say the gold price looks good, we'll stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest stop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded in recent months up to 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its stoppers.
The growth in the pavilion sector is so great that ValueMax, the branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says the Executive Director of ValueMax Jo Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD that she won at the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discounted creditors were under criticism due to high interest, Mrs. Jo says that the arrest offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not increase the debt directly.
“The customer stops the items already owned, and the pricing of personal property does not increase the household debt,” he says.
In the company, the depreciation of assets is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use the pawnshops, they're not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branches when they stop the golden rods or Rolex watch, and they can reach up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are of all kinds of relationships.
"There are rich individuals who need to borrow short term because of their courageous business or investment, or small businesses who need help to solve their cash flow problems," says Mrs. Joová.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
Rescue Package worth $325 million for Tasmanian Health
The Federal Government insists that the rescue package worth $325 million for comin' health in Tasmania contains tough conditions to ensure that the government does not lose money.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Australian Union is making “accelerated measures” to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years has been decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilk.
"The government came with an emergency rescue package, which, as we believe, solves the specific problems the state faces," said today Mrs Plibersek.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for the surgery at the request of the patient.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopedic operations and grey haul operations, will help to remove debt.
Money is also on freely accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of healthcare professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that the leading clinical physicians told me that they would best help the Tasmanian health system," said Mrs Plibersek.
The Ministry stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union and to inform each month where additional funds were incurred.
A three-member committee will be set to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will be useless, “ until a real reform is followed in order to lay down a more sustainable foundation of the Tasmanian public health system.”
Yet, he praised the government for responding to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first expressed in negotiations with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can unleash public health from a critical state," said Wilkie.
According to the government, these additional procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Speaker of federal opposition in the field of health, Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just "plasty."
"The reason why I am here is that the labourist government has removed $430 million from our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and the Australian union, which devotes $300 million, and faces it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no one of the dollars from the rescue package will be issued for a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the Denise Diderota novel, which brings an exceptional film expedition and time creation, but is also more boring than it should be.
In the '60s of the 18th century, France begins and tells a stunning story about Suzanne, a young noble person who is sent to a monastery by his family.
When he wakes up, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally perverted mother presented and for others becomes the object of sexual passion.
The movie never slips to the booze or to sleepyness, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to the audience experience torture similar to the wear of a worm shirt.

Syria destroyed its means for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervising authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, said on Thursday the Committee on Global Monitoring of Chemical Weapons, while the sharp conflicts in the north of the country, not far from one of the locations where the poisonous substances are presumed.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 people were killed since the beginning of civil war almost three years ago.
A notice of the Chemical Arms Prohibition Organisation came the day before 1 November,
the term laid down by this organisation with its registered office in Hague for the destruction or deterioration of the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals in order to create poisonous gas and ammunition.
The completion of this essentially in the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable which aims to destroy all Damaszek's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
This country is expected to have about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including yperitet and sarine nerve gas.
The notification came at the moment when the fight in Safira was furious on Thursday, which the experts spoke of as the factory's registered office for the production of chemical weapons and storage facilities, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through the network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
This makes 61 067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29 954 members of the Armed Forces of Bashar Asada, 18 678 government warriors and 187 soldiers from the Lebanese Hizballah.
There are also 2,202 government survivors and about 5,375 opposition warriors, many of which are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organization estimated that 100,000 people died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
A conflict made about 2 million people leave the country.
Asad’s forces fought against rebels in Saphrah, many of which are connected to Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The Watchtower said on Thursday, the losses were on both sides, but they had no specific numbers.
Fights undermine the dangers facing inspectors for chemical weapons, who face in their mission, when Syria's in the midst of the ongoing civil war to remove chemical arsenal, must deal with tight deadlines.
In the OPCW statement, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that his team is now “satisfactory that he verified – and followed destruction – the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/fill”.
He added that “no other control activities are currently being planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed their first round of verification work when they visited 21 of 23 seats declared Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW authorities stated that these two seats were ‘occupied by Syria and ... items of the chemical weapons programme that it contained were transferred to two other declared locations that were checked’.
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of the places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria agreed on the plan of complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I cling to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most difficult mission that this organization has ever had," said the director of the observers Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment given by the OPCW.
Now, in his third year, he stands against himself in civil war, especially Sunni Muslim rebels and Asado's government with its security forces, which are full of the Alawit cult, the backbone of Shield Islam.
As for further development, the Chief of Observatory Ramí Abdul Rahmán said that there was a strong explosion in the middle of an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikíja.
He said the cause of the explosion was not known.
Anger over the judgment of a bomb attacker on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bombing attack on Bali in 2002 responded strongly to a judgment raised above the last of the senators who were built against justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of prison for building an explosive device that was used in the bombing attack yesterday.
In 15 years, he could be released on condition.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were left dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty at several other points of charge related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia at Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded a lifetime, although it could insist on the man with the nickname “Demolition man” (bourac) due to his reputation of an expert in the production of explosives being punished.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who, in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other senators, lost their 39-year-old Jane and Jenny twins almost 10 years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow the others.
For the AAP, Mrs. Corteen, she said: "He should be built before the executioner."
Every day, I have to live with not seeing other grandchildren and my daughters.
Sari's club was compared to the country when it was on October 12, 2002 shortly after 23 p.m. a strong charge located outside the parked van.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber fired a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times “he died.”
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as three other members of the terrorist cell Jamama Islamia responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imamama Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
To get 20 years for killing 202 people and hurt hundreds of others, it's not that much.
Patek was the last of the assassins in Bali in court.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but eventually in January 2011 he was caught in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later the American forces killed the former leader of Al-Qaida Osama bin Ladina.
During the trial, the FBI's agent stated in his testimony that the news reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect the terrorist groups from South-Eastern Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't volunteer," said Mrs. Corteen.
Up until now, he felt no regret for how much grief he caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will be part of the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to the judgment.
FAA: Travelers in air transport can now use technological extracts on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from the gate to the gate” – except for calling from their mobile phones – to read, play, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of impatiently expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, travelers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
As soon as the change will be made, according to individual airline companies, the FAA Michael Huerta manager said at the press conference.
Air companies will have to add to FAA’s management, as far as their aeroplanes correspond to the new rules and that they have updated training manuals for the crew and the Directives for the storage of equipment in order to comply with the new rules.
FAA argued that it had already received plans from some airline companies to extend the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already passed the plans.
" Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic equipment very quickly," said the FAA in its statement.
At the moment, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches three kilometers, and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their equipment again when the plane is dropping to land, and they won't shut them down until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airline companies whose aircraft are correctly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during the flight, landing and travelling, the FAA has indicated.
Most new airplanes and other aircraft that have been adapted so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to fulfil these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Stuards, welcomed the changes.
"When the new rules are safely implemented – and we will cooperate closely with transport companies – it will be a success," said Glading.
We're frankly tired of looking like "guards."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and texts or downloading data will continue to be below 3 kilometres above sea height, said the Agency.
The traveler will be notified to turn their smart phones, tablets and other equipment into the air mode.
So still no Words with friends, the online scrabble game played by Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011 when he was, as well known, fired from American Airlines aircraft because he refused to shut down his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like laptops will have to be kept up because of fear that they could injure someone if they were flying in the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for using mobile phones do not define FAA, but the American Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may abolish the ban in certain electronic devices during the take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Security Committee on Transport, National Security Expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered to be a risk.
"The mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from the FCC data that may cause the air towers to disturb," said Rosenker.
In order to examine this problem, the FAA Advisory Committee proposed last month that the government would allow the use of electronic equipment to be wider.
At FAA, pressure has been developed in recent years to mitigate the restrictions on their use.
The critic, like senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic of Missouri, claims that there is no legal security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such equipment is all-time.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers, they also forget to turn off or ignore their devices.
FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disturbance of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios, the technical extraction of time ago.
New airlines are far more dedicated to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed and approved by FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airline companies have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi in travel altitudes for several years.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The large majority of airline companies should be adapted in the framework of the new rules for the greater use of electronic equipment, said Huert.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasts than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimum broadcasts when turning the page.
But the broadcast is stronger when the device downloads or sends the data.
Among those who push to release the restrictions on the use of these facilities by passengers, Amazon.com is.
In 2011, the representatives of this company loaded the airplane with Kindle's electronic readers and carried out the test flight, but there was no problem.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as regards whether these facilities represent any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Airline Passenger Association said that it is convinced that the interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have declared that there are only ruptured reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disturbances in air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during flying according to instruments at low viability.
The group of tourism has welcomed these changes and it believes that it is a reasonable procedure for the public travellers which uses the technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airborne transported from the drilling platform in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after he was found exhausted on the petroleum platform in the Black Sea, and released back into free nature.
One helicopter was transferred to Aberdeen last month after the Scottish company of SPCA was treated in the rescue centre before he recovered.
Colin Seddon’s operating centre said: “This was probably migrating from North Europe when he captured a strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently, he got out of power and he found refuge on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was not able to take off again, so we were contacted with the request for help. ”
At the time he was released, he was in good condition and he was healthy.
Is the European elite ready for the British trade?
The campaign Business for Britain (the UK trade) was launched in April with a promise to connect businesses and define what changes in the EU want to see British entrepreneurs and jobs.
To this end, we have launched the largest and most complex survey in which the leading British entrepreneurs have asked their views on Britain, Trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing the UK's various sizes and different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vicious majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernise and grow while EU countries stagnise.
They want to see how the government favours new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than in a long and striking process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked their views on the specific political areas – from monopoly regulation to the legislation on products – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the Single Market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulation are now prevailing the advantages of being part of the European trade area – even 40 percent of large enterprises, namely traditionally the most pro-European companies.
Finally, our research of leading companies revealed the most remarkable knowledge, although the unambiguous majority want Britain to seek to change the contract and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not policy.
From the findings with which undertakings of different sizes and major business groups have identified, it shows that the business sector is pushing on a "intential change" which will be transferred back to Britain.
It is at stake a lot – achieving a change in the Treaty and a better agreement for Britain can be gained up to 16% in the vote in the EU's referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that the British trade supports its plan to revise the terms of the UK membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects that this amendment will result in a significant shift from the current balance of forces back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and even more necessary, given how the euro area is heading on a road for the earlier economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be the jobs and growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, it means re-orientation on trade and fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admitted that spying went too far!
The United States sometimes went "over far" in spying, admitted by AFP the head of American diplomacy John Kerry during a videoconference between Washington and London.
According to the Minister, the collection of information was used to revoke terrorist attacks.
"The first confession from Washington" according to the AFP was heard in the midst of the sharp sky in both March Atlantic due to the scandalous detection of mass monitoring of the American National Security Agency (NSA), whose target was also American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, like the President (Barack Obama), some of these events have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
However, in the interview, he was defending old practice.
According to him, the collection of information is essential for combating terrorism and preventing assassinations such as attacks from 11 September 2001 in the USA, assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings exploded, and people were murdered because we were able to be informed about the scenes in time," stressed Kerry.
However, again, he admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went unproportionally far".

Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is opening a new gas era
The launch of South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Director Gazprom.
"Today we have seen the sword: the construction of the South Stream South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that direct links to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed by “goods”.
Once the entire project starts in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from South Stream gas at a cheap price.
Gazprom says that the construction in other countries is expected to start by the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 billion cubic gas traces.
Hizballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
They're waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Movement of Hizballah distributed 15,000 of its warriors north of Damascus in preparation for a deciding battle on the rocky area of Kalamun.
According to the constantly clarifying reports, Israel destroyed the missiles intended for Hizballah during the midways to two seats in Western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiitian organization is fighting in Syria on the side of that army.
Her programme is also a fight against Israel, which does not interfere with Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it would prevent the movement of weapons to the hands of Hizballah to Lebanon.
The reports of the medieval attacks of Israel on weapons warehouses in Western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel didn't comment on the attack, but he was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian Dampress.com website, missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea by the Syrian rocket base Snúbar Jabla south of Latákía.
The news station al-Arabia claims that two warehouses were affected in which the missiles were ready to transport to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was the Russian SA-8 production missiles.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballah with missiles and Syrian air force teaches members of the armed Hizballah section to treat rockets.
SA-8 are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has since the '80s.
They're located on a moving chase.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar, but after the missile burns off, so it's hard to target them.
Latákíja lies in the western Syria, in the area surrounded by governmental alavity.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hizballah was involved in the fights in Western Syria in the past.
He claims that he helps to protect the Syrian Shiith community, which it belongs to.
Now, apparently, 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help the army get back to Kalamun.
With Hizballah there, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle is to be retaliated according to the source of al-Arabia for the recent attack of the opposition at the headquarters of Syrian Shield Brigade Abú Fadla Abbás in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army to fight back this year by the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border.
Many rebels from Kusajra just left for Kalamun.
Recently, most citizens in the Czech Republic seemed to wish for premature elections.
Corruption, distributing money for overprietary purchases and state contracts, tax increases, and, in the last place, government scandals.
According to the results of the election, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were in line with this condition.
That they were actually inconvenient with the situation that was here (receiving and debting of this state), they were actually satisfied.
In other words, I can't explain that 3 413 497 voters did not make the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 ODS voted totally 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all right-paid voters.
Which is over half the majority.
When I add 1 016 829 of the ČSSD voters to the above, then with the old order (because all of these parties participated in the "discretion" and debting of the state), then 64.23% of the right-of-law voters agreed with this condition.
In fact, the majority of voters showed that they are not to punish the guilty of stealing and defacing the state.
Or do you think that the members of the CSSD who participated in this are subject to applicable laws?
Is there any way to help us?

The Royal Commission found that two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) were accused of the action against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Committee on sexual abuse of children learned that before accusation against the childhood educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children.
But before the committee, it was said that in its initial statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked if one of YMCA's employees was accused of offences relating to child pornography, and another, when a bodyguard in Caringbah from the YMCA association was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children that he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the Commission's counselor that he knew about the first case, but not the other.
He admitted that the initial declaration of the YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that the YMCA had carried out external audits, which have assessed this organisation as a leading supporter for children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that the YMCA was pointed out that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him itself failed down when Mr. Lord was accepted without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to notify the child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys who had committed in two years of working in the YMCA association.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare refused to claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a child safety breach by Mr. Lord.
The staff had provided evidence that they were witnessing such violations, including that the Lord was alone, privately guarding them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the subject of Lord's presidency and asked for children's safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, headed for the services of children in the YMCA association in Caringbah, which was the Lord's superior, was “a very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him.”
The Director-General said that he does not accept the staff's evidence that they felt unbearable if they were to contact their superiors and deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord has impaired their judgment, and that is why they have not reported the problem.
Mr Hare said that the YMCA Council in New South Wales told his opinion that the lessons from the "Jonathan Lord's case" for the organization were that the staff "not given any report" and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreement shortly after the accusation has appeared was made by the Director-General for the Services of the Children's Organization of YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the aim was to avoid invading evidence, but was “excellently zealous” and misunderstood.
Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not safe in 2009 to 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, testing, working, training and staff management.
The hearing was deferred to December 20th.
Tony Blair said that he would use a chance to return to the Minister's post, but he admitted that return is unlikely.
On the nightly interview on the opportunity of his fifth anniversary to leave the office of 59 years of politics, he expressed his views on the various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned in the lead position, Mr Blair mostly avoided interviews about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the High-Eastern Peace Quartet.
When he was asked whether he would return to the post of the Prime Minister, his answer to the London newspaper Evening Standard quoted: “Yes, of course, but it may be difficult to do so, so..."
While in Cardiff, the crowds of experts gathered to show horses in order to fight for the price of the Horse of the year, everyone was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But nobody was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirklanda.
Although they're not going to school yet and only a few months ago he made first steps, this boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly slipped three rounds to finally gain the main prize and left 30 wanderings with adult opponents.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was commended at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank Riding Centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff for the appearance, behavior and style.
He stood up against the gentlemen and ladies in the elegant hats, put his baret in a happy angle and let his two-year-old Toffee promenade through the circuit.
Fenton was commended by the jurors for his natural ability to control horses, which are far beyond his age.
And Toffee's got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March, and he's been practicing with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna (30) said: “Fenton and Toffee are working well together.”
They didn't make great hopes, but they finally left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
The boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes to traces of her aunt Sharon Howells, who shows the horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone encouraged and clawed. ”
He ran through the sand throughout the length of the arena and even though he did so minorly, he gave great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has been responsible for two chickens.
Given how he started, he'll be back soon at the horse of the year and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
The speaker of the annual competition of horses said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony.”
They make a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed themselves on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the team work is between the pony and the one who lead it – and Fenton and Toffee were on the ball.
I'm sure Fenton helped the lovely clothes, he really fell there with him.
Too explored newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspapers on the front page asked for release of the reporter accused of the accused will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
New Express News with its registered office in Guangzhou made a rare public request for release by Chen Yongzhou.
But later on, Mr. Chen admitted that he was taking bribes to make up stories about society partly owned by the State.
The manager said that New Express's newspaper is now going to do a "full axle".
The regulation on "repair" came from the State Administration for Publications and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that, between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express from the yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about Zoomlion.
"New Express was unorganized," said the administrator in his statement.
He said that he had to decide “safe Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment in the form of an abolition of the press licence.”
Furthermore, “I ordered the yangcheng group Evening News to carry out an overall remedy of the New Express letter, and recommended that the responsible persons in New Express be investigated and immediately change the New Express leadership.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express, which relate to financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being detained, his newspapers issued two requests for release on the front page and claimed to be worth his work as a journalist.
But then Mr. Chen showed up on the state television and admitted that he gave false stories for repayment.
"In this case, I have caused the damage to Zoomlion, as well as the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," said CCTV at the State Intelligence Station.
I've done it mainly because I've had money and glory.
I realize I was acting bad.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he published the New Express letter on the title page of the apology in which he said that he failed when he did not carry out sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, it made a confession on TV by a number of suspiciously watched suspects.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, irrespective of the change in the law of this year, which prohibits the authorities to force anyone to charge himself.
It was found a tunnel for drug trafficking between the US and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sensible tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel about a dimension of about one meter as one of the most thoughtful secret corridors they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of almost six football courses, connects the warehouse near Tijuany in Mexico and San Diego in the USA.
This area is filled with indefinite warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel was closed before the drug was unseen.
As well as the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men who according to the authorities worked as drivers were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine to distribute them.
In the event of convicts, the punishment of deprivation of freedom from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, the smugglers penetrate into extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest hall found in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico, which builds the problem before the drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.

CME aims at TV business.
He'll release almost a quarter of people.
The media group of CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to snap a thousand people.
He intends to cut off all side activities and he only wants to focus on his main business, television broadcasts.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic, also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs around 4 500 people.
That's how almost a quarter of people lose their job.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds a license for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV music stations.
How much savings will touch the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic TV number Nova, it is not yet clear.
"That is premature, and we really can't comment on it," said the head of communication of the New Joseph Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, significant releases of the Czech Republic will not be avoided, but this should have the greatest impact on the personal status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new heads of Novy Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined Adrian Sarbuo, during the medic conference call with analysts, spoke about wanting to limit all activities that do not directly relate to television business.
Therefore, it is highly likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of production of its own programmes, film and production activities.
In the ČKD industrial area in Prague, the cooling tower burned at night
In the ČKD industrial area in Prague, a large-capacity reservoir burned, according to firemen, apparently a cooling tower.
"To the fire fire, firemen went out on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, yet fired," said the spokesman of the Prague firemen, Pavlína Adamcová.
The amount of damage in the air in the area of the measurement did not exceed the permitted limits.
The damages and causes of the fire are unknown so far.
Around five dozen firemen arrived at Kolbenova Street.
"One of the fire of a large-capacity reservoir, probably a cooling tower," said Adamc.
"In the area there is no functional hydrant network, so we fire through the cisteren transport line," she added.
According to the tn.cz server, the displacement of the poorly functioning hydrant network had to be used to transport the water from one another.
The commander of the firefighters has reported a second degree of fire alarm.
They're at a rate of four, in the most serious situations, the fourth is reported.
The chemists went out to check the level of dangerous substances that could get into the air in the fire.
"But they did not measure in the air the amount of harm that would exceed the hygiene standards," said the spokesman of firemen.
The British Police have delivered an announcement to Assange.
The British police have delivered today a notification of the release of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian ambassador in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said that he delivered a "announcement" to Australan for 40 years, asking him to come to the police station and that if he does not, he may be threatened with arrest.
Assange, under the British law, exhausted his possibilities when the Supreme Court canceled his appeal against the issue this month and faced the release to Sweden for sexual crime charges.
Since he was afraid that Stockholm would go to the United States, he sought refuge on 19 June at the Equatorian Embassy in London, where this South American country asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard “explained the announcement of a 40-year-old man who asked him to come to the police station on the day and an hour he was designated to him,” said the spokesman.
Assange continues to violate the terms of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notice of issue.
Assange is afraid that he will be released from Sweden to the United States, where he can face spy charges, because on the WikiLeaks website he published 250,000 American diplomatic documents.
The driver got a fine of 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist got a fine of 1,000 quid for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a drink cup between his thighs.
At Colchester Howie's police court, he confessed to accusations that he was driving carelessly and reluctantly.
On his account there were seven points, resulting in a six-month ban on the proceedings.
Howiem was also ordered to repay the cost of £90 and the surplus for accused £100.
As a result of the tax on the owners of foreign property, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance pre-allocated the tax on the income of financial assets, but awaits Mr Osborna's final decision, which presented in the 2012 budget a fee of 7 % for the transfer of real estate for buildings in the price of more than 2 million pounds and an annual fee for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
The amount of the property transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total sum for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northeast and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “In view of the increase in the transfer of property in homes of high value and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is not taxed, regardless of the effect of the outdated system of taxation from the head.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to avoid buying in London, or that existing owners would avoid selling.”
The front properties – the top 5 % to 10 % of the flat market according to the price – in the rich belt, which reaches Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11,8 % in the past year.
Prices in the middle of London continue to show a stable growth of 5.6% from the year onwards, but were covered by a growing ‘domestic market’ on which, according to the survey of the real estate office of Savills, the southwest, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) of the increases.
Scientists have explained more how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Earlier research has shown that joyous dogs drill their tails more right (from a dog's view), while nervous dogs have their tail mostly left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can record and respond to these fine differences in the tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist from the University of Trent, said: “In people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different links to stimulating positive or negative emotions. ”
We were trying to see the same in other species.
He added that, as it is in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for levoruous movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In trying to get further information about how dogs react to the indirect drilling tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched videos about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analysed their behavior.
It's probably not gonna take long to understand why their tail is going on one side, and another on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We rejected dogs' films about dogs – whether in natural version or in the form of siluette – to get rid of any mattress stimulus, and we also managed to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrate it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw otherwise unmarkable dog to move the tail to the right (with a dog looking at the heeling tail), she remained completely calm.
However, when it recorded the filming of the tail mainly left (review of the dog spinning tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted insecurely.
Professor Vallortigara said that he doesn't think dogs would be consciously communicating through these movements.
Rather, he believes that the dogs from experience have learned which movements they have to and which they do not need to be careful.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and move their tail one direction is repeatedly linked to more friendly behavior and the movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help the owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers to understand the emotions of their animals better.
A professor at the behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, a high-school teacher at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side for dogs is important.
Last year, the Lincoln team found that dogs turn their head off on the left watching aggressive dog, and on the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another expert discussion from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “As dog robot, dogs were more likely to be familiar with when he snapped his tail to the left than the right when they were rather insecure – precisely against the Italian study.”
The difference can be given by dogs in these different studies, animals in movies or dog robots did not speak entirely like dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“In the case of many different mammals, there are good evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are not exceptions,” said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't take long to understand why their tail goes to one side and another.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alex Turner's disease, they moved the concert in Glasgow

Pope František named the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope František, February 22, for the first time, appointed a new Cardinal of the Catholic Church.
The Cardinals have the highest position in the Catholic Church right after the pope and they are the Pope voters, so František will set up his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as the cardinal reaches the age of 80, no longer can participate in the pope elections, the group is thus reduced to 120 voters.
In the statement declaring this report, the Friend of Federico Lombardi, spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of current cardinals known as consistency will be held before the celebration of the new cardinal promotion.
“Papiež František decided to communicate his decision to call the February Consistency in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings which require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices letter said that the number of voters will probably fall by February.
He said that the Pope usually calls as many cardinals as it is necessary for the number of voters to rise again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistorium will be important next year, because it will be the first after František was elected in March this year, said Valero.
At this point there is some orientation for Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a minor number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of Cardinals since Francis has set up the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which he has tasked to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
“Now František chose these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that “the doctrine is possible” that the Pope's cardinals would ask for advice.
But in this situation we have not been before – it is absolutely new.
Valero said that the Popes traditionally increased to the position of the cardinals of bishops from large places, but František is “full surprise – so we don't know who he is”.
GM downloads some new light cars in the USA for repairing the seat backup
According to the Friday notice from the U.S. Authority for Automotive Safety, General Motors downloads almost 19,000 of its new (2014) light cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to correct the failure with manual straping.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism may be the failure of the front seats.
As a result, seat backings are not in accordance with federal standards of automotive safety for head restraints.
The notices on the Road State Transport Security website (NHTSA) say that “if the car gets hit from the back, the head restraint does not have to protect the passengers correctly, which increases the risk of accident”.
The downloaded models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
GM put the supply on the market in June and for this front American car is the most important placement of the vehicle on the market from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the supply owners of the failure in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the notification to the owners because of the 16-day failure of the government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were recast for models of 2014, increased to about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year in Friday, GM.
In October, GM sold from its deliveries 42,660 models Silverado and 16,503 models Sierra.
New York Stocks increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Repulsive shouting of Obama's voter
I chose both twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says that Obama's sincere efforts have shattered the obstruction of the Republican Party
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the strains of the website of Obama's health care or attacks of unmanned aircraft
Obam's 2008 Memorials are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I read a sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the cloudy days of my second year at the medical faculty would encourage me and restore my hope.
It is called "The Capacity to Win" (the trumpet to victory) and it is the memories of the President's campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finish the patient's review tonight and go to bed, the book returns me to the time that politics inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath.
The elections ended with a stubborn advantage, and television intelligence forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were joyful, and my parents were hiding the papers they got.
The young visionary team was headed to the White House, and the nation was ready to change.
During the 2008 introduction, Obama had 82 percent of the aid.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a rough awakening, as a wake up from your dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be remote memories, a sad reminder of the lost opportunities.
Years after I dropped my first voter ticket, there were real changes.
It was definitely not what I imagined.
I admit that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on available care through the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of policy "no questions, nothing to say" after the death of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party obstructions have turned so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is an immigration reform, the possibility of public to choose health care and to close the base in Guantanam.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from my colleagues and friends, I, as far as the explanations they can provide, reached an absolute limit.
I found myself at a place of political hope.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the consent of listening to foreign leaders or the unmanned aircraft to kill innocent children in the overseas.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, or that it persecutes those who reveal the wrong behavior of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakí, the American citizen, without a proper court or for the restriction of public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify findings of a report that says the efforts of the White House to shut down the media are “unaggressiver... from Nixon's administration.”
And the newest, nor can they excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the Act for the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like this could be expected.
Whether I should have suspected in 18 years that governmental power could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded her.
Clearly, the option has no predictable progress, and our public conversations will form a opposition political party and incidents like a massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples I have put above seem to be largely the result of my own administrative decision.
And that bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidate.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbleached alternative, and he seemed to be unable to strengthen his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Yet, the return to 2008 – with the fact that Obama's support has fallen below 45% this week – through this book, it's getting harder.
He's making me remember the number of promises that disappeared.
This week, I read in the book the chapter on how Obama suffered a vicious defeat with Clinton at Pennsylvania's primates.
He told his staff at the additional meeting during the campaign that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest for the parental leave programme
Miliardary and Ms Clive Palmer say that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave programme, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Banan magnate, which is a dispute with respect to the payment of a coal tax diversion of $6 million, expressed this claim when he tried to erase the question of whether it was in conflict of interest.
The United Party of Palmer can control up to four votes in the Chamber, which will play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect coal taxes and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in the conflict of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interests with regard to a paid parental holiday, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would be interested in getting a parental vacation,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the election committee officially declared Mr Palmer a winner in the fight for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast with 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer asked to review the electoral results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget's daughter.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the election rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, get details on your computer, vote immediately and have results at 7:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark voters.
The point is, the results can be vomited if anyone doesn't like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Election Commission studied the possibilities of electronic vote and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new work “very seriously”.
The Public Office is a public service.
"We do not strive for any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists found out he washing your hands would also change your NATURE.
98 persons, divided into three groups, participated in the experiment.
The first two were tasked to solve an unresolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But a group who washing her hands off after failure was more optimistic than the one where her hands weren't washed.
Also, the group "with washed hands" did better in the next test than the other one.
Yet, those who washed their hands had achieved worse results in other tests than those who had no washing them.
The results of the "waste" were at the level of the third group whose participants did not notice any previous failures.
The results of the test show by psychologists that physical purity removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation drops, testing must be much more focused in other tests.
If we had passed the results of research in Bohemia, we'd probably be the optimistic after returning to the toilet.
After the use of the toilet, he does not wash his hands only one percent of Czechs and Czechs, but on the road by city transport it's already five.
Hygiene is usually licked also after working in the garden or in a workshop where 85 percent people are washing their hands.
The chilling of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
The recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and the Slovaks, as much as it is necessary to wash your hands after hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of the Slovaks will wash their hands.
The research showed that both nations were washing their hands about ten times a day.
"But whatever it would be in place, I'm afraid that reality is different, and people are trying to do a little better," commented on the results of the skin survey by cliudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two traders with foreign currency
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is further indication that the global investigation by the control authorities concerning suspected monetary market machining is increasingly increasing.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with competent authorities in the investigations of the largest financial market in the world, where every day the owners change 5.3 billion USD.
The mention of two traders would be the first employees of the RBS suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which is referred to a LIBOR control scandal (Londoan interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that the authorities received a request for information this month.
"Our unsimilar searching in this matter continues and we work fully with the FCA and our other bodies," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event reported that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and quick reports sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position by the European President of foreign currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European Chairman of cash trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former leader of the currency trade in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were charged with any offence.
The bankers from Barclays and Citigroup included the Usher Group for sending fast messages, said the people of the dedication to this event.
The UBS Bank expressed this week that after the Swiss control authority Finma announced that he investigated suspected machining on the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it took steps against one of its employees.
The European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Office of Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – examines the claim that these bankers have been licked to move the monetary market.
People of the familiarity said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received an application from the competent authorities.
Banks are proving years with quick news and e-mails to find cases of offences.
The investigation reports have alerted traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines to generate profits in investment banks' locks in previous years, but which has been disturbed by the small instability of the currencies limiting the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid market with foreign currency, it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high position traders say that it does not necessarily have to be true.
A highly constructed trader said that despite a significant volume of day-to-day liquidity trading between different commercial platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to affect the market at relatively low prices”.
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she released this week from its trading department of a trader who caused a loss of almost USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately warned the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand.
Doctors in Prague have registered over a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the investigation in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolitan area.
It comes from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to it, 2 063 have been infected throughout the Czech Republic.
Immunity failure has already broken in 396.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has been growing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later, were 121.
In 2009, the exam revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
The number fell to 153, but last year was record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, no longer I believe," refers the expert to AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague Light House for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year at 47, said headat.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the surveillance until the end of September, HIV tests have confirmed in 1710 males and 353 women.
The disease of AIDS broke in 161 males and 37 women.
The most infected was in Prague.
If you really want to meet a city, you should go to a cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk by the citizens' center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would say bedekr.
Many people read from graves.
The cemeteries are slowly struggling and getting intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what kind of people here live, what kind of faith they believe, how big and coherent families belong to, in what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
In what way they express their social position as they have taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will also find out how they take care of their dead people.
The Supreme Court supported the Law of Obama on Health
The U.S. Supreme Court decided that the law on health care signed by Barack Obama is consistent with the Constitution, which is a major victory for Obam's administration.
In proportion to the vote 5:4, the Court has decided that the Individual Regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which urges citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise it threatens them to pay the fine – does not support the Institute on the basis of governmental tax powers.
Prime Minister John Roberts stood on the side of the four more liberal members of the court, while Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the Law on 2700 pages and decided that the legal requirement for health care which orders the States to extend the possibility of obtaining sick insurance, otherwise, the removal of all funding of the sickness insurance from federal sources is not enforceable and contrary to the constitution.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have lodged a plea in order to block this law.
During the 2012 Prime Minister, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
The word "Mugabe's a painful donkey" is no longer at risk of prison, the court cancels the law.
Up until now, the Zimbabwans had to be careful of the public talking about the ninety-seven-year-old Mugab, who has been in control of the country since the beginning of the '80s, since the end of 1987, she has been in her forehead.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, a fine of 100 dollars was at risk for disregarding the Presidential Office.
"National representatives should not be zealously accused of people commenting on the president in pubs or in other public places," said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government appeals against the court decision, informed the British BBC.
Against the law, a number of damaged Zimbabwans, among them Tendai Danga, whose police arrested two years ago for the alleged offense of the president in an argument with a police officer in the bar.
In May the opposition activist ended up in prison in the public of Mugabe's "clutch asses".
In August, the prosecutor accused a sixteen-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared a counter-institution law limiting the freedom of the media.
"The State cannot punish people whose statement will later appear untruthful," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, the Zimbabwian Law allowed a person who would publish lies to be sentenced to twenty flights of the prisoner.
"The existence of a law to criminalize someone for false statements has a frozen effect on the right to freely express themselves," Malala added.
Notwithstanding Mugabe’s harsh country for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties.
The small steps from the dictatorship of one man of the country entered the agreement between Mugab and the opposition to the Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai.
However, the economic crisis continues to suffer from the world’s highest inflation by 2008, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other countries apply.
The impoverished economy goes to Mugabe's unreliable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he divided the land of white farmers between his favourors and the war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with the Pharaoh.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fede, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will enable banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks have put this in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the main international economist of the Barclays Bank of London.
"By now all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not my surprise," says Vojtěch Benda, the main economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first crushed.
Central banks' agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing for the end of its US economy support programme, which could evade the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity of one currency at the current liquidity surplus of the second currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a borrowing of the second currency.
The ECB launches the third attempt to return confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
Like Tipsport (no) will delete personal data.
More than a year ago, I performed a registration on Tipsport.cz website.
But I didn't finish it after that, because there was just someone sitting on the office who couldn't finish online registration.
And since I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration fell, then I moved, and that's what changed my ID number.
When I wanted to finish my registration later, I was told that this was impossible because I had another OP number, an address, and that I simply can't finish it and that I should ask for the data deletion and make a new registration.
I did that, and I wrote 24.10.2013 to technical support that I request to delete all my personal data from the database under the applicable personal data protection law.
The rainbow day has written me technical support to finish my registration at the office.
This started the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where after 4 urgans 25.10. they wrote that personal data on my request had been deleted.
So you would say that you could do the new registration and here the problems started again first, it wrote to me that my user name is already occupied (I understand it wasn't deleted - it's not personal data, but they eventually erased this).
So I used another user name and jumped on me that my personal data already have been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have been saved by something that claims to be deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
On my question, how could it be written to me that the personal data really deleted 25.10. and to send an e-mail with that error.
This is what I did (more than 15 hours) and they wrote to me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is not why I used the same name and date of birth.
What I've been contacting technical support for a week, and I've dealt with them that this is still impossible.
And what if it were true what it claims (which it is not) it could not be registered by anyone with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in 13,22 I actually registered myself, on the same name and date of birth, but I used an invented e-mail and phone number and the world of wonder, it appeared to me that they sent a link to my e-mail to complete my registration.
But how is it possible if you can't register on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to an e-mail and phone number, and the data just didn't exclude as he claims.
So I once again told the technical support that they simply lie (be deliberately and or do not know what they're writing) because what they're writing is not true.
I added several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So the "false" registration doesn't simply affect this.
I'm sorry, but by the fact that you're registered again, we can't check your claims.
And he ended the communication.
Respectively repeats the same sentence that registration is binding on the name and date of birth.
They cannot accept nor accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and did not actually run.
So if I sum up, Tipsport didn't just erase the data as he claims, but still lies when he claims otherwise.
The worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like a mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after placing this issue on my personal blog, things went a little bit in motion and from technical support came an e-mail that the matter was handed over and will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and warning on the same error).
In the subway on the Bridge, music plays
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the project Music in the subway.
The first instinct where the metro plays continuously reproductive instrumental music during operation is the Bridge of Line A on the exit of the Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Singer Michal Horáček brought his completely new doubleCD Czech calendar to the Cologne Hall, but first of all on the show between us singers Lenka Novou, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matthew Benka.
After the initial intrusion and the acting ethics of the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came up with a candle in his hand and reminded a story about the last time they played in Cologne and in the the theatre, and the entire city fell electricity.
"They produced two types of cards in Cologne, with which I had a lot of contact with," he recalled.
So did the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could make tours after the Zákolanes or the Dúbraves at Bratislava," he chanted on the family of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not talk, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the eagle, about the ice hockey, but then he had no idea how to meet us on these squares and scandals, who does not jump, is Bohemia.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we're not gonna play you here today," he has fun.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang a lot of good sleep for him on a day, singing nights and accompanying her on a guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played the percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the key, cello, guitar and counterbas.
All three vocalists singed a little scrubbing In the stray of the heart used, which immediately scrambled the viewpoint.
"I'm glad that the song was interested in you, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," then Michal Horáček responded.
After the remembrance of Peter Hapk, I note in the submission of František Segrad, in the original from Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge aplaus, Hana Heger again reminded the composition of the father loved Lída Baar and the Horack's explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer of Michael Kocáb again reminded the composition of Sebastián, Segrado then sang a wonderful song Prague lost by Jarda Svoboda, a sad native and former Cologne.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in standing and the addition in the form of optimistic compositions we live in a wonderful time.
There was one more supplement on the playlist, but the fans didn't cheer up.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire four seats behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with any interested ones took pictures.
Berdycha with Štěpánko supplements Rosol and Hájek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the unplaying captain of the Czech tennis Jaroslav Navrátil the four-door Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they're going to play the competition field in the white garden arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from November 15th to November 17th.
The Czechs are the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to a hot land that it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We're going there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the uncle of the winning point in the final last year with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bombard Syria.
The U.S. Commander in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf of Persia.
The Israelites have demonstrated exactly what Syria's bombing should look like.
Without unnecessary humbuk, threats, and millions of statements sent out aircraft, they hit the target and returned.
Without letting them be deformed by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They're refusing to confirm the whole action, and they're not expressing themselves to it anymore.
The exact opposite of confusion and great, acts unsigned by Obama's Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying of the attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media be confused with their claims that the "syrian base" or "Hizbalah deliveries" was bombed.
I recently wrote here that while the help of the U.S. secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetoric plane, Russia continues to deliver Syria's weapons.
And just a fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latákija became the target of Israel's raid.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Asad's regime, not the rebellion, although it would be according to popular online theories.
The U.S. government has acknowledged 2 members of spacial units, probably Delta Force.
It hasn't known until now that they were declared during the attack on the American consulate in Bengaz.
She's known for the heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city, I think they were members of the CIA secret commander who was formed by former soldiers.
It's been speculating for a long time what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in the other CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
However, information that the CIA has its offices protected by bulletin nests in Libya (rightly, both SEALs died after the hit by the minomet) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about two unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. Commander in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report on the attack in Bengaz, they volunteered to intervene and together with five private contractors shot their way to the CIA area in Bengaz.
Obama's administration is blaming the fact that during the attack it was not officially planted and all and that it was just hesitating to do.
Commander of the commander, so without orders, he will probably release these volunteers.
Either way, the fact that it works in the country undisposedly, but the permanent American commanders, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And given that, until recently, it has been officially admitted, and it is now only talking about some NATO consultancy mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States even though half-year-olds are trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would want much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It's not that long ago, the media almost singed Iranian air force for prosecuting American drones.
However, few people know how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if he accidentally shows up his drone in the airspace, there's nothing we can do about it.
However, if Iranians are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that Iranian aeroplane F-4 Phantom chased the American drone in an international space above the sea, which may have been the first sharp launch of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He underwent Phantom to optically verify his armor without Phantom registering it on radar or just noticed it, and then when he suddenly showed up at him and called an Iranian pilot to return home, the one without reptending listened to him.
There's nothing to wonder when Phantom is an aeroplane of America's production, but he remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, the defender or guardian of Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that has brought back to his representation after a year.
He's doing the shots, he's digging activity, he's got a fine kick in a game in Teplice.
Victoria was touching in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but eventually, these two duels took the only point.
František Rajtoral believes his team in the fight with Jablonec will break an unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat the Jablonec at home," František Rajtoral promises.
The manhood is preparing carefully for a heavy fight with the North Bohemians who play attack football.
Everything's about to fight with Jablonce, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video game selection of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," attracts the Czech fans to the Doosan Arena tribune.
Plenty of the last matches didn't go as it would, but the word of the crisis, Victorie, refuses.
That's how football goes, sometimes you have a good form, and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we'll win on Friday, and it'll be good again," refers to the Westchard Defender.
Victoria's man will rely on supporting fans again.
"He's playing Friday night, and that's what I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we owe them a win," Rajtoral says.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step, but a big jump - a few years back into memory, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like, not worrying, and just coming out of school and washing the dishes, polishing and doing tasks.
Although these "obligations", it was mostly just theory, the wishes of parents.
Practice was completely different-- running from school, throwing a bag in the corner and running out.
Play with other kids ball games, jump a drink.
Then on Helena's show and her boys embroidery with a patch stitching stitch for grandma's birthday.
And then after a few warnings to wash the dishes, to exclude, in winter to carry wood into the tiles stones and tasks to do after dark under the lamp (or to rely on the classmate and instead of the tasks to write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, to eat domestic strawberries (from real fruit, not such jams that are sold now, whose content was next to strawberries or lying) and to drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mom and I were so happy to collect.
I also remember the magical evenings when grave silence in the room when we recorded with my sister's radio songs on tapes that were loudly rolling in the old tapekeeper after my mom.
And then on the pencil, we've been twisting the tapes and playing the same song, our favorite, and they're drinking it with a siphone.
Or we called through the table using cans that were tied to each other with a string - and when we were on the phone to hear each other better, it was necessary to clean your ears thoroughly, then the ears were a match + watts.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now and my parents were able to live out of it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhony, iPady ba even phones and laptops or brand clothes.
The dressing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "summer" in the wardrobe was a batty shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From electronics, we had enough to be satisfied with the mentioned mom's tapekeeper and maximum Walkman, which we shared with the sister and which by the way we used on a train on a school trip as well.
It's more interesting to play with Aunt Hop hat or Man, don't be angry, or as I've already said to go "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a videoplayer under the tree, my parents certainly saved it for a long time, but, unfortunately, he hasn't warmed up for a long time.
My younger sister used a snake in him, so beautifully papaled the tapes, so she tried to see if she slept as well.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, and this event has tonight, poorer, on a plate from Dad all the time.
He says that when Lenka was a little girl, she took a scrub in the video and thought she was gonna play a recipe and he didn't lose it, that's why he can't bail him up until now.
I remember how we were all able to communicate, reach out without a cell phone, computers.
Together with my sister at the holidays with her grandmother, the neighbor's granddaughter's granddaughter, when we meet again next year at her grandmother's summer, and that's what it was.
We met.
Promise someone you'll see in a year!
I also remember the winter when the whole village was running outside, building snowflakes, riding on a snowy hill at the church on bags of hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, we heard each other before dinner with a notorious phrase: "Wash your hands!"
Yes, that applies today, but you certainly don't have soap tied to the bathroom in the lemon net.
After dinner, when my dad in the garage "worked" at beer with Jarda from the village, we lay with my mom on the floor, cast her legs on the duck stove, opened the door and watched the flames and listened to the cracking of the wood that licked from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, texts.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And that's how I could continue for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at the albums, where they are contemplated with black corners created by black and white photos.
And if I accidentally didn't know how old I was then, from behind the photographs is always written a year to get a picture.
I look at the fact that although the cuts according to the pot weren't very good for us and we had pants after our cousin two numbers bigger, no one had ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather get back to reality.
By 2013, I'll be waiting for what modern times will make, like, once for my children.
What I know is that these memories are now for a young teenage generation, at least, somewhere, a hundred years behind monkeys, and I don't think they're going to lose a lot that they're not going to experience.
I wish they were!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies sued for Nortel patents
The company owned by thousands of patents of the deceased Nortel has filed a patent infringement on Thursday, including Google, the company which was transferred to the auction under Nortel bankruptcy.
The Rockstar, which purchased Nortel's $4,5 billion patents, sued the US Circumference Court in Texas, Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations.
Rockstar is a joint property of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violations of seven patents.
Patents include technologies that help merge the expressions that are searched on the Internet with the relevant advertising, refer to the action, which is the core of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately to reach.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on the Google Android operating system that strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million starting price offer for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After fighting for the Nortel patents defeated by Rockstar, Google received $12.5 billion of Motorola Mobility, which was motivated by a partly group of Motorola patents.
‘In spite of failure to obtain patents under dispute in auction, Google patents violated and continues to violate,’ states the action.
Rockstar seeks to increase the compensation of Google’s damage because it believes that Google’s patent is infringed intentionally, as claimed by the action.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came outside, from 4 degrees Celsia, which we're not used to.
First, she put a smile away, the one who kept putting on a vain as a defense against a friendship surroundings.
She was so relieved because it was a mask she decided not to postpone in public.
He was honest at home only the day she was grandma and had grandchildren Elinka or Adík around herself.
And, of course, when her sons were on the phone.
She remembered a lesson from endless courses of business skills.
Now they're really good at it.
So she doesn't grieve her nearest.
Then he flew into a corner.
It's like a mascara change.
November, not even another month can do the miracle to make her smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that's almost three years gone.
Egypt refers to the office of the first free President
Muhammad Mursí made an inaugural oath, but his triumph day will only be difficult to end political disturbances in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursí promised “new Egypt,” when he was solemnly introduced to the office as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husim Mubárak, who was settled 16 months earlier.
Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the state since the monarchy was over 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges cast into black plates in a mansion built with a view of Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for better tomorrow, the new Egypt and the other Republic," Mursi said during the ceremony of lively broadcasting on state television.
"The Egyptian people today set the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursi, the sixty-year engineer educated in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which was, most of 84 years from its creation, as an illegal organisation of the sharp attacks of the governments.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 hours of local time in a small car column, hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the courthouse to celebrate the President, and unlike the Presidential prospects of Mubarak’s period, the transport was shortly stopped so that the colon could travel a typically busy way connecting the city centre with the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, delightedly referred to as the “reservative tire” of the Muslim Brotherhood, increased sharply from his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as the candidate of Islamist, but also to all those who wanted to lead to the end of the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubárak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state,” said Mursi, trapped in a blue social suit with a red tie for judges in a wood-based chamber where he made a vow.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was supposed to present an inauguration speech.
While he was careful, he got the official welcome from the military band who played the national anthem.
The military commander of the field marshal Husajn Tantaví was present.
His coming was accompanied by the scandal of “arms and people are one hand" of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s became the bass of Islamic student movements.
Mursí made a symbolic oath on Tahrír Square on Friday, in a place where the revolution was born, who ended last year by the authoritarian government of Mubárak, and solemnly promised that he would take the presidential powers taken back by his office by the military council that took them away from an outraged leader.
But by agreeing to make official oaths before the court, rather than before the parliament, as a habit, he has chosen the will of the army, which suggests that the fight for power will continue.
Mursí's speech at Tahrir was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
I think there's gonna be police specialists in the ghettos, to relieve the tension.
In the ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should work in the future.
They'd spend half their time here.
They'd keep an eye on order and deal with the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing the tension between people from poor places and people from the surroundings.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior counts.
According to him, it would help to improve the situation in the country mainly to "accelerated social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, around 300 poor homes and quarters were in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
They lived in 80,000 people, mostly the Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was freaking out.
According to the experts of the problem locations, hundreds of them have arrived.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are growing up.
In several places the anti-Roman marches took place.
The extremists also joined the people of the area.
According to the inside, the police are challenging in the areas with the ghettos of safety and order.
The essential condition is that "consistent application of equal access to enforcement" is said.
But he says that without a detailed knowledge of the place and the people cannot be achieved.
The Specialist would go to the ghetto walks where he would spend up to half his service, and the rest would serve in his district.
He'd keep an eye on order in a troubled location.
He would also know locals, so he could solve better problems or offences.
"Thanks of confidentiality will be more easily able to prevent a number of infringements," said inside.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive surcharges, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police to problematic areas is to be funded by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600.000 (now about CZK 15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, funds 85 percent.
The preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project is to last until 2016.
Authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are the so-called Roma settlements," reports the authors.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it's not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special policeman would need.
It will also depend on how much money for these members will be able to release the police every year after the end of the project.
According to the design of the project, first, the police are attending the internship in Slovakia.
A yearly training should be carried out by five dozen members.
They're the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for policemen who will operate in the ghettos.
According to authors, social housing would mainly help to improve the situation.
He said it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea of the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet the hostels with the precise rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The medium standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards should have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The leasants would have to follow the integration plan that would be assembled by social workers.
They would have to follow the order of accommodation, take care of their health, send children to school, retrain and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would go into a higher standard of housing.
The internal housing system should work for at least 30 years until another generation grows up "in an interintegratively motivated environment".
The social housing model prepares local development and work resorts.
They're supposed to suggest it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrchol - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The carbon hill is a conspicuous hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, the evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jesene in the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a larger distance is at the top of the Columbus Mountain a stunning whitely rejected baroque pilgrimage church of Virgin Mary Helpné, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrim chapel.
The guestman who stood next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church, the alley was blown out of four rows of July, long about 1 km.
The cross road to the carbon hill is already the third version, the original here stood after 1916, the second, from 2001 only until 2004.
At 15 stops there are wooden plastics that made the local art carver František Niemlel.
He used various woods in the area of Low Jesenic.
Similarly, the substrates of the mountains from the area here form an interesting geographic exhibition.
The name of the sponsor shall be indicated at each stop.
Carbon top is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements are slightly different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (three 3.3 million years old) and older than Venushina volcano (the age of 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
In it she cast a large amount of volcanic ash together with the fragments of the mountains from the grounds that burned with reddening.
At the end of this phase, the lava was leaked on the surface - today it's a layer of a peasant man up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption has cast red, brown, and places to black tuffins.
Their layer is up to 50 meters powerful and its part is accessible in the wall of the lome.
There are conspicuous volcanic poms of up to 1 meter in the tuffins, and the second eruption was closed with the lift of the lava.
At the end of the activity of the volcano, there was a lava, which today formed up to 50 m of a strong layer of a struskovity sensor.
The volcanoes in which the dumping of volcano ash with extinctions is the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they got the name of the stratovulkana.
The original volcanic cone was subject to gradually erosion.
However, he was threatened with mining in the loom on the south side.
The most intense mining here took place in 1953 - 1962.
The tuphins were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The work has managed to stop under the pressure of both experts and the public and thus maintain this unique place.
The problem is, however, in the periphery and small coherence of the mountains that are rapidly exploding are falling apart and moving down the slope.
Lom disappears quite quickly.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, it is a warm, south-oriented slope ideal for some rare species of plants and animals.
The repair is therefore problematic, but in time it will have to be chosen and maintained by a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, such profiles are maintaining a number of important sites.
You will get to the carbon hill from Bruntal, or from Slezský Kočov.
Automobilists can use the unpaid parking at the beginning of the lime alley, where a short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel station.
Ivana grew up and spent more of her life in an active villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa quarters in Ořechovce.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in the restitution and the tenants had to move with a small distance.
Therefore, Ivana was quickly looking for a spare place for herself and her older mom.
She has received a tip on apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock, first, but the view from the fourth floor to the large forest park and the dam overwhelmed me on the other side," Ivan recalls the first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a provizorium for about three years.
"We live here today for more than 13 years and not only for a gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a hundred-timer apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment distributed.
The action was not simple, things were stored with friends and graduation took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting doors or window exchange.
The previous owner has hacked the core, but the owner most disadvantaged the irradiantly solved and unnecessarily large hall, and a small bathroom.
A multifunctional living space was created by the connection of two rooms.
Architects used to define the individual zones and the division of the room of the castorcarton, which allowed a new location of lights.
The first intervention to which she decided for a few years was to remove the surplus in the living room.
The apartment has changed to 2 + kk, but the room has gained airiness and has opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
The next step to partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
Ivan's bathroom didn't know how to handle it.
I've been picking up living magazines for years and looking for inspiration.
I recently found interesting realization in one of them.
So I spoke to Kamila Doudíra as a young architect.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the restoration of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the available front hall.
The architect connected the space of the toilet and the bathroom and the two doors with the open wings replaced with one sliding, thereby saving the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also sufficiently barrier-free.
The quality covers imitate sandstones, in the shower there is a comfortable seat, a bidet shower on a cage.
Successful cooperation with Kaila Doudíra continued.
In the framework of the show, how the dreams appeared quickly, but the fundamental transformation of the living room, which also participated in architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping to a space that was created by two smaller rooms without helping each other with the classic principles of optical separation, the purchasing of halfways or Japanese walls.
"That would violate the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
It managed to separate the sleeping and living part originally.
It was enough to turn the backs of two sofas and build between them a room made cabinet for pearls.
The dining corner defines the shades of the floor and paint.
On the floor in the kitchen and the dining corner, the architect used a quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette covers slide panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new floor from antiallergic marmolea has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate: soft illuminating surface without coupling and better sound isolation.
The system of excretions and suspicion from the gyrocarton highlighted by the colour is a demonstration of how you can work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wish it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
Deck of graphs with motive bloomed magnolie is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, the architects have chosen a white tone which has undermined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were saved, among other things, into a space under the window parapets.
Everything's in range, the lamps are comfortable in remote control.
In the refined interior, it works excellently new contrast with the elder, for example with dozens of years old crystal mirrors and quality arts that Ivana collects all his life.
The last one on the line came in the kitchen.
The lockers were previously placed on both sides and the owner seemed a little bit like in the tunnel.
The Architecture has taken their number and rescheduled the deployment.
Furniture in simple design is made on custom, the white area captures a slightly pearl surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to an ingenious solution washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of a small kitchen has revived the whole glass wall cover over the work plate.
The unique graphoscloth with digitally printed motive is attractive, and it is well maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia that remind her of the popular neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and washbasin, the new owner chose the neutral shade of the enclosure.
The big shower corner has Ronal's glass door.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment in which the functions and devices will be in harmony.
We have united the interior material and colorfully and tried for its elegant, cosy, not too crowded appearance.
"The next condition was the barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of items of daily needs," says Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has decided: There is time to be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has decided that the former Prime Minister Peter Netime can be prosecuted for any offences he could have committed before the August desolation of the House of the House.
It was only protected by procedural immunity that relates to speeches in the House.
In the case of former Members of ODS Ivan Fuksy, Mark Šnajdra and Petr Tluchor, he decided, on the contrary, that it could not be punished for any offence until they gave up the mandate last November, the spokesman of the Supreme Court, Peter Knötig.
The Court of First Instance rejected this decision the proposal by the Attorney of Iv Istvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and will not make problems in approving laws.
On the contrary, a former Prime Minister who offered them these posts can be pursued further.
You and Barta also arrested an anti-corruption police officer.
Bart's defender Oldřich Chudoba, who represented him in the case of alleged corruption by VV Members, also did not want to comment on the case, but he said: "Yes, I represent a client in this matter, but I cannot comment further on the protection of classified facts."
According to information, the case is addressed by the General Security Board Inspection (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Barta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server of firstnizprav.cz, the case could have coincided with the case of the former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment was allegedly attempted at Bart's office.
The latest information of the Law shows that the arrest of Víta Barty is not related to Petr Lessy.
Speaker of police presidency, Eva Kropač, refused to comment on the case of Prague City Attorney.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of classified facts," said the spokesman of the City Prosecutor in Prague Štěpánka Zenklová on Friday.
In fact, the case is being supervised by the prosecutor Bartov and, indirectly, it shows that the file or criminal proceedings are being held under the coverage regime.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Barty Kateřina Klasna in the morning before they were resided in Prague Klárov.
She was just putting the trunks in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the detention of Bartov was expressed by the leader of the Switness Tomio Okamura movement.
He says he doesn't know what's going on in the bail.
"With Barta was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the dawn of direct democracy tomia Okamura," he added.
Welcome to Barta, who in the past premature elections to the House in the Pilsen region failed to run for the movement of direct democracy Tomia Okamura, is known by his corruption causa of bridging Members of the public affairs.
In April 2012, he was irrelevantly sentenced to 18 months with 30 months deference.
Then the judgment was changed and Barta was dismissed.
I want a contract at the NHL.
Juice, lust and thirst I still have
For Prospala, there was always a family first, which is why she wanted to be fully subjected to herself in her 38-year-olds.
Either he gets a job in the overseas, and he's still going to extend his career, or he's gonna end up with a hockey.
"I want to do my dad and my husband's role."
"I'm looking forward to it," says a hockey player who's still waiting for an offer.
Despite the fact that he's a pronounced worker who'll never fool anything.
Despite leaving the hearts on the ice every time, and it can smash the teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still," says determined.
He may be able to reach, allegedly the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and have two injured oppositions, Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's attackers.
What's your arrival in the Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on my paper, it's no good to deal with.
I know the article came out in New York Post's journal that they should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere was supplied that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
You haven't even heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes from.
When a player gets hurt or it doesn't work for anyone, and the manchaft doesn't work.
There are a lot of different factors that have to gather together to get the contract.
But in New York, they're just like the circumstances, aren't they?
The wounded is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team didn't enter the season, so there's some chance there is, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
But the second thing is, you always need two sides for it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're going to America on Friday, you're expecting something to clap?
I have the expectations since July 5, when the NHL market opened up with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and to see you again.
Do you have a scheduled program?
He's given me to be a father and a husband, and that's what he's doing.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna do my dad and my husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
Your friend has two hockey games on Sunday, that's for me and my whole family's holidays when we can go back our kids in what they want to do.
You think you could do this in full-time quotes?
Yeah, you can think of a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very much.
Once it gets into such a phase, that all goals, victory and passes won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could ever meet, except for my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, I'm in the first place, except for the family, I'm a sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life's going on.
My children, I'm sorry, our children, my children, and my women, grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we'd be so happy if they would continue this trend.
Because what we're going to talk about, there are options in America somewhere else.
We should offer them a chance.
So you're planning to stay in America forever?
We're going to practice it as far as we can.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia on the Deep and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps lead us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've had great happiness in my life.
It's like I went across the street, it cost a lot of power, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But the hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where we live with a woman.
There's a lot of people in the world who want to do this so they can choose what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long will you be able to work, train hard and wait for the offer at your age?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the thirst, the thrill, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on NHL, I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's still going to be there.
You can't plan that.
So you can say you'll wait this season for it to come up and then decide what's next?
I'm at the stage of the day from day to day.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that the decision to build 3. and 4. of the Temelín power plant is postponed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified it by waiting for the new State Energy concept and by agreeing the Contracts of Difference by the Government.
These reasons are the current leadership of the ČEZ attempting to transfer its responsibility to the government - for the major actors.
But a qualified manager should give shareholders a recommendation, not hide behind him.
I'm only in charge of Saturday.
Andrej Babiš begins to agree that his movement ANO will not have time to learn political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to even form one.
The chairman ANO admitted it in an interview for the Law that comes out tomorrow.

Police evacuated for shooting part of the airport in Los Angeles
The international airport in Los Angeles was shot in the morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly the terminal three.
Reuters with appeals to the California media says the men of the law have shot a gun of a gun of a man.
Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, said there was a shooter in which two to three passengers of the Transport Safety Administration were injured.
How many people have been quite injured and whether there are victims, but it is still not obvious.
Firemen talk about events with more wounded.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The aim was to be Russian rockets for Hizballah.
Israel’s military aeroplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latákia on Thursday.
With appeal to the unnamed official of the U.S. government, it was announced by the CNN TV.
Israel’s press on the explosion in the alleged warehouse of missiles widely informed, but the Israeli government did not confirm it.
The speaker of the Israeli army refused to comment on the CNN question.
"We are not expressing ourselves to the news of foreign media," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, Israel’s target was a missile and related equipment, which, according to the view of the Israelites, could be transported to the military movement of Hizballah.
The AP with appeal to another American security agent informed that the target of Israel's attack on the Syrian territory was the Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israel’s television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a high-tech Syrian anti-air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area but according to the DPA have shown Russian missile batteries of S-125 Nova.
In addition, they have been seen with SA-3 missile batteries including a radar commander to monitor missiles and their targets.
The recorded missiles have 35 kilometers of the Israeli television report and could carry the heads of 70 kilos.
Israel has been bombing the shipments of missiles within Syria this year at least twice, as indicated by CNN and AP.
The Israeli army never responded to such reports, but repeatedly proclaimed that it would hit any supply of weapons intended for Hizballah or other groups identified as terrorists.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems successfully to resist this trend.
The company updated the estimate of annual profit and expects record profits from Recreants in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before tax to be between USD 325 and USD 340 million compared to USD 305 to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase in relation to the record profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
The Director-General of Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an eight-procent profit in the first half, and the second half began with sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel outside the service trip.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable, and several are aimed at a record annual profit before interest and taxation,” he said.
This belongs to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our greatest profitmakers.
The business with recreational activities has increased during the second half of Australia, compensating a slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.

The Greenpeace Activists detained in Russia were transported to Petrohrad
Ecological activists detained from September in Russia for a protest against planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
The AFP has been informed about this today with an appeal to Greenpeace's international organic organization.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges of her pirate activists have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women, held in Russia after a non-violent event against the oil platform in Arktida, were transported from the repair facility in Murmansk to a prison in Petrohrad," announced the organization in the declaration.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA, it was a planned transfer.
Ecology authorities first accused of piracy, for which in the event of convicts, they were at risk for up to 15 years of imprisonment.
But last week, they announced that this accusation would replace the less disruption for which a lower penalty at the top of seven years of the detention of freedom is at stake.
But in today's statement, Greenpeace noted that the pirate charges had not yet been withdrawn, as they promised.
That means the detention is now accused of two crimes.
The powerful Investigation Committee announced last week that the piracy charges would replace the riot charges.
But when the 30 prisoners faced the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not withdrawn.
Instead, a new accusation was brought against everyone," quoted the AFP from the Greenpeace statement.
The Russians held three tens of the Greenpeace movements originating in 18 countries at Gazprom's oil platform in mid-September.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship that was flying under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they've all been held in custody against which they have filed appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
The ecologists complain about the terms of prison.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, today said that the transfer to Petrohrad will facilitate meetings held with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in a new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
She asked for help from the Dutch King Willem-Alexandra one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on the monarch to talk about their situation at the planned meeting with Russian President Vladimire Putin.
He argues that Little has a great share in the renewal of sectural violence in Iraq, which is also partly partly the fights in the neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At the hours of English literature, at least one Shakespeare game, the 19th century novel, the romantic poetry and the current British belettery since 1914.
The test will also include a ‘closured text’ to motivate deeper reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a graduate test of their language and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new curriculums for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first items to pass radical changes.
Changes are expected next year for other essential subjects.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which supervises maturity tests, will reveal changes in the structure of a graduation test, together with a new system of marking and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that “the broad consensus is about whether we need to reform our test system to regain the trust of society” and that it is necessary to insist on the maturity test to be“ more ambitious, more ambitious and stricter.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For the comparison of schools in Australia, mathematics spend on average 143 hours a year and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there is no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition resources have indicated that the comprehensive mathematics test – with greater emphasis on this subject in the results ladders – probably will encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The teaching plan will focus more on “the problems of the real world”, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Primátor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD I am not me
A long-running dispute between the two wings fighting for influence inside the Ostrava ČSSD was burned before the elections.
It all came up by the time the prime minister of Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned to court for the non-democratic assembly of candidates.
However, the Kauza activists did not want to say too much to make the party no more damage before the elections.
But now the voters are numbered.
The headquarters of Ostrava ČSSD immediately on Monday night invited the primator of Ostrava to step out of the side, and apparently pushes to lose his function.
Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on in disputes and who's on whose side, he described in an exclusive conversation for the journal.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
I'm sure the CSSD was counting on a much better result.
Did it hurt us that the media had disputed within the side before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now in.
It's a side that has its internal problems, it's innerly ill, and people feel it's not all right in it.
In the elections, they made it clear.
What are the inner diseases of the ČSSD?
In my opinion, I've been going through ODS for a while, and these things are now unfortunately happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influenced people who had previously expected to find their prebendes at the ODS, moved to the people in the ČSSD and have influenced them.
It's related to the fact that after the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate, the police go and collect computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not composed of only people who would want the good of all others, but many of them mainly think of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two non-commercial camps and in Prague, as is seen in the current fight for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a prophecy of what is happening in Prague.
The Haškovo wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections it could cause situations that weaken Sobotkovo wing.
One is in politics in a situation where sometimes you have to approach compromises.
But everyone has some internal boundary when they don't go to compromise anymore, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run to the House, but when I perceived the whole thing within the side, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálk that I would try to get to a regional candidate to strengthen the Sobotka wing as Prime Minister Ostrava.
Haškova's wing gave me a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Godslav Sobotka, not Michal Haška?
I think the glory of Saturday is a man who always speaks mainly about the ČSSD program and to some extent as well as the visions for the side and for this country.
I'll admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I don't understand how the Bureau, which is lower than the Central Executive Committee, can just start calling the Chairperson of the Party.
This is a fight for power regardless of everything and against the positions of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now demonstrated in Prague has ended his political career.
As you perceived that the Ostrava Headquarters of the Czech Republic did not approve of your candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition that is placed on the part of their members.
The competition should be based on program visions and the ability to fill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have power or vision are also reporting into this competition, but the political party is a lift for money that they would not have gotten elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get ahead because they break the rules without contempt, they violate the parties' statutes.
They make their practices from the political sides of the mafia, and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to consider whether Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Hence, before the elections, did you submit a proposal to the court for preliminary action against the form of a CSSD candidate in the Moravian region?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava strengthens its power by revoking organisations that do not comply with it, the purpose of setting up a new organisation, gradually throwing out uncomfortable members of the Party.
For example, they wanted to rule out Richard Bednařík from the deputy club, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and then they would rather cancel the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that it is the last possibility of a party to be respected by the courts, but when the other means and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
The attempt to lead the Ostrava ČSSD in the forehead with Mr Adam Rykalou is to dispel you from the position of the primator.
It's a public secret that Mayor Lumír Palyza has an interest in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything so they can call me off.
They promise people's positions, they get voices, and then they strengthen their power in the side for the voices.
When I go back to the past, all that happened around the Ostrava football club and the Bazala Stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially inspired to be labeled as a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought assets that are strategically valuable to him.
So how do you see it further with your persistence in the function of the primator?
The county committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our persistence in the CSSD.
But I think it's like the thief screams, grab a thief!
When we look at the results of my work in the past eleven years, I don't see anyone in the Ostrava Social Democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against the members of the party, there are so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or expansion of a scientific-technological park.
Yet, everything becomes uncomfortable.
I'm not reading it differently than making it impossible for the others to pee to the places they want.
Are you going to try to fight these other things?
Because if this Republic is supposed to work well, political parties must work well.
I can hardly believe that any side will be able to drive the state effectively if he can't drive himself.
So I don't think that I would leave the ČSSD now because I think that whoever causes cancer to this side is not me, but those people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens in the historic centre of the public glider
The organizer of the olomouck Christmas markets and the winter skating Pavel Spálený said that the preparations at the glider were launched on October 26, and from the Wednesday there is an ice-producing aggregate.

The brutal murder of the senior in Zlín will reconsider the county court
The county court dismissed the defendant of the 25-year-old Slovak and the twenty-five-year-old Bohemian Republic for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the guilt.
They're 15 to 20 years in prison or a special punishment.
Speaker Peter Angyalossy confirmed that the Chief Court of First Instance cancelled the country's decision and returned the matter to him again.
The reasons led by the judge to comment on the fact that the decisions have not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the defendant, the young men robbed a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
Senior died of tragedy death.
According to the defendant, his men were strangled, beaten and kicked all over his body, and also the metal object, apparently the gas gun, planted about three dozens of wounds in his head.
A man suffered severe injury, such as the fracture of the skull bone, the swelling of the brain or the bleeding to the brain that he found at the site.
The young people allegedly took about 3,000 crowns from the house and some 14,000 crowns of jewelry.
According to the county court, the only, indirect evidence against the defendant's smell marks, which the expert considered as not fully identified in the sense of legal guidance.
Although the smell marks of the crime scene in more than ten cases were consistent with the defendant, the police treated them at first as material and not smell marks.
In addition, there was a certain doubt in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found some relatives who thought he probably fell and hurt himself.
Even a doctor called for rescue services did not notice the violent deaths.
A few days later, criminals contacted Olomouc doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police couldn't work with any traces from the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
There was no DNA of the defendants on the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherscohradisk.
He now repays the sentence of 8.5 last year, which confirmed him by a lawfully broken court.
He believed he was the head of a group of six young men who had a robbery of gold.
Loupees were in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopny.
Younger of the accused of the murder of the senior lives in Uherské Hradnice.
He was released from custody in August 11 months.
Znojmo begins with reconstruction of the stadium
In the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders who were conducting the reconstruction of the lawn.
Reconstruction of the City Stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages in order to comply with the standards for the first football league.
Live legend Wayne Shorter closes the next week of Straws fall
The saxophone great and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make a dot next Wednesday for the 18th edition of Struna's autumn festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6th in the Lucerny Grand Hall together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
On the second half of the evening Shorter joins the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžák.
In Shorter adjustments for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus works from the news album Without A Net, as well as its older compositions of Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his eighth birthday this August, Shorter is still full of power, which also proves that the Prague concert in the Struns of autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over 60 years ago.
The reading of the interprets that he cooperated with is from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santan.
On his musical trip, he met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Viennese rodent Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade they gave direction to a new style of fusion.
For the last thirteen years he's been performing especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Asusi after the festival will still be the Spotlight club night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to Andrea Triany's charismatic singer, the national audience will present the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its tongue influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which brings the electro-jazz formation of Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Women say that EUFA is forbidden to publish sanctions for arbitrators.
Dagmar Damk, President of the Board of Judgement of the Czech Republic Football Association, has ceased to publish penalties for barrels.
It's banned by the EUFA rules, which she said in a conversation for the Law journal.
Otherwise, the FAČR would be threatened by a penalty.
Damka also refused to partake in her function to the football players of Plznia, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the committee are different, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of the vote, I can lose 1:6," said Damk in response to criticism that crashed after Pilsen played twice as much penalts as other league teams recently.
Hence, although the FAČR has ceased to publish sanctions for judges in recent months, Damk assures that they are sued for their mistakes.
"Believ me that if the committee finds that the judge made a mistake, he will limit his delegation, whatever the game was," Damk said.
The reason why the punishments are not published is according to Damk's ban from the European Football Union.
"EUFA prohibits and severely punishes the disclosure of such information."
"We're very suspicious with us, and we're looking for something in every mistake."
"We published the restrictions, but I got two very important warnings that if we don't stop, they'll come hard sanctions," said Damk.
Other countries respect the prohibition.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If information continues to be published, it is said that the Commission could lose money from the EUFA to the education and development of arbitrators.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we couldn't fill a program on jurors' education," Damk added.
The arrest of Barty relates to Janoušek and Beem: Are they behind the leak?
The President of the Public Affairs of the Vita Bart, arrested the police on Thursday.
He was also detained by the head of the study union and informatics of the anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek.
The arrest is related to the lobbisty of Roman Janousk and the former primate Paul Bém (ODS).
Information about the posts with which the server News.cz came, confirmed the Czech printing office a trusted source.
The listened phone calls Janouška and Béma, which published last March the journal Young Front Today and in which both men referred to each other "Mazánek" and "Kolibřík", show Janoušk's influence on the steps of the city under the command of Bem.
The journal then stated that in 2007 it was acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later he escaped to the ABL Security Agency.
That's when Bart owned it.
Server News.cz alerted that a detained criminal Petržílek was working before he joined the anticorruption police just for the BIS.
The anticorruption unit, which was subsequently addressed, Petržílek crossed at the same time as they were published.
"In view of the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot say anything at all," said the prosecutor Michal Muravský of the City State Prosecutor in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was watching the bail.
For the same reason, the case doesn't want to comment on any inspection.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for a new civil law.
Six companies out of ten are intensively prepared for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and Trade Corporate Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company’s representatives questioned claimed that the two key codes in their company were not addressed at all.
It comes from the research of the Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal law firms, which found out the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
A number of managers are only beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on their company's business at the last minute in relation to the near term of effectiveness of the two key codes.
The biggest changes in private law in the past 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavatory of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty whether revolution change eventually occurs or not.
"There are now only a few weeks left to move to new law for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáka.
From 61 percent of the companies engaged in new legislation, 26 percent indicated that their companies have already taken all the necessary measures to ensure that they are ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of the companies from this number are about to take the necessary measures soon.
Against this, every fifth recodification company has not yet dealt with, yet has a particular idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent has no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of the companies admit that recodification issues have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal topic relating to the new civil law is the largest number of companies in question for the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the solution of trade conditions (16 percent) and the changes in the property catastrophe and the damage liability (after 10 percent).
One of the most important news of the entire recodification will be held in the contracting process only within the new Civil Code.
The current parallel adjustment in both civil and commercial legislation will disappear, as a result of which the contract law should become more transparent for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with emphasis on the greater freedom to organise relations," said Advocate Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Podal.
In the context of the Act on Business Corporate, it is considered the most important topic of almost a quarter of the company's issue of increasing the responsibility of the statutory authorities.
It also follows topics concerning changes in the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation shall mean the tightening of obligations and possible impacts on the statutory authorities, in particular in situations where the company threatens or reaches into the bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the Board and the companies are not dealing with the care of a proper economic operator and do not reverse the threatful collapse of the company, they may lose the benefit gained for the performance of their duties in the last two years," he added Speak.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Cartier's style as a living language
It is my task to maintain the tradition and at the same time to lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a damaging relic, explains in the interview for HN its position Pierre Rainero, the director of style in Cartier.
This French luxury house was established in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care for villages in Cameroon.
Bwell and his team will treat almost hundreds of patients every weekend.
There are not too many doctors in Western Africa; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the CNN Hrdin 2013 prize.
You can vote for him or any other of the 10 main candidates in the CNN Hero Year 2013 contest.
The winner will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched his father again and again fall into unconsciousness and drives to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde in a car accident.
First he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, and there it created a haematom that caused his whole life problems.
"There were no neurosurgers in Cameroon," says Georges Bwell.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had money.
Instead, Bwell spent years transporting his father to a crowded clinic and hospitals where he got that kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," he says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first one.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people only die because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation has not changed too much.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor is in Cameroon for 5,000 inhabitants.
Only for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor at 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroon doctors could visit, many could not afford it.
Two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwell.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his counties suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer team performed a free 700 operation last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a non-profit organization of ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped with their group volunteers.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people are in the supply, attaching to the roofs of medical needs and traveling rough terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always comes with happiness.
At some point, the vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as real heroes: feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation community can offer.
In these villages, medical care is free of charge for celebrating and Bwelle – with its wide smile and untapped energy – is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day, the team begins to nurse hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each trip," says Bwell.
They're coming to the village of 60 kilometers, walking.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, under nutrition, diabetes, parasite diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get berles or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires school, but which can simply not afford many godly families.
In the evening, the team is doing simple surgery under local narcosis.
Operations are usually done in a school building, a town hall or home; a patient gets up after surgery and goes to a recovery site to release the place for another patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating rooms and the hygiene equipment of Bwell and his volunteers work in early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue to work, play drums all night," says Bwelle.
Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired, but proud of his work.
This group, consisting of camera doctors and foreign medical students, has carried out 700 free operations last year and realizes that their assistance can be a great deal for the local population.
One man said after the hernia surgery, he'll be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organising these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at the Bwell hospital also works at night for private medical clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second job is financed by about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who second year studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and works as a volunteer for Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get the money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical students and nursery services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle's mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"Doctor Bwell, we washed our hands thoroughly and removed the blood spots or kept his tools," says O'Malley.
That's like a second-year-old medical student in America you'll never experience.
Students will normally pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with gifted medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaounde, food, transport and study provide them with Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
For Bwell's, it's not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling the promise he gave to his father, is something that brings great joy to him.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwell.
And I think of my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, mitigate their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed the function of the Headquarters for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number exceeds 100 thousand in the Czech Republic.
"I consider it essential that this function is clearly defined and formalised in order to have the health nurses of their representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they may always address, if necessary," explained Mr Holcat, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of my sister and I think that the field of care deserves to be given due attention to him, too, by the Ministry.
In the performance of this profession, not only high professional professionalism is needed, but also human approach and personal beliefs.
"I'm going to try to enforce the steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skillful sisters in our health, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who are not helping us with their approach to patients to carry out all empathy and help us improve the image of the sister in the public," says Alena Šmidová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated that she wanted to deal with the various aspects of the health professional position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I do not want to separate the profession of doctors and sisters, but I see them beside me, each has its competence and together with other healthcare professionals form a part of a work team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that the sisters experience in the profession, I feel these difficulty, and I intend to participate in their solutions."
They include, for example, ensuring the simplification of medical and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative actions of the sisters are unnecessarily harassing and costing them time that they could and should give more attention to patients," says Alena Šmidová.
Other areas to be focused on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve mutual cooperation in the team and with management of healthcare providers, adjustments of competences, as well as working issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or the non-extortion of their sisters with a lack of number at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous steaks, which, however, are not documented for the specific case where the rules might be breached.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is neither a judge, and in this case the function of the Czech Heads of Nurses could serve as a guarantee to maintain anonymity of such complaints and a specific case to allow the competent authorities to examine," concludes Alen Šmidová.
Mgr. Alena Šmíd graduated from the Central Medical School in the field of Healthcare Nurse (absolved in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the Study Programme of Nursing - Education (absolving in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been head of the Department of Treatment and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications in the field of education and science of MZČR.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at the bed in the internal department, she continued to act as a teacher at the Central Health School, where she was also 8 years of the statutory representative of the Director.
From 2004 to 2009, she was the principal sister of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several expert textbooks of nursery and articles in professional journals, dedicated to lecture activities in the field of care.
She's not a part of any political party.

What moved that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it to keep me out of hate.
Seeing around yourself all the new and new clones of that human foolish littleness, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I'm not even talking about us older, faces ruined by helpless desires, velvet souls, and opposed ideologists who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of small sales whores.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera, and I filmed my judorous friends, weirdos and hidden departments.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brains burning out of my life on this planet.
I like to go for a walk, and then I read books at the lamp tonight.
You're talking about the feeling of vanquishing, hate.
Is there a break in the past that affects you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break was once a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, that's what I lived after.
There's still a silent boy inside.
I see more lonely trainers, everyone in my tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm taking part in the giant, thousands of years of continuing movement of the system of life on this planet - the spread of the incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathing complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful game, where experiment-omyl creates another and another generation of beings that in the bilione interactions in a second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you perceive your writing as a continuous process, or have you started completely with zero?
Self-contract, or better said the dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows to the level and forms in the book.
Like the period of peace, it's been circumcised by quietly sleeping metastases of wars that may wake up one day, so my book is 12 years of silence in words.
I've felt that avalanche of life grows in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'll be quiet.
It's a set of questions that the brain formulated and puts them in layers that are stored in the dark "under the consciousness".
Neocortex, grey cortex, asks older evolutionary departments, goes to ancient flyers of the brain tree.
He speaks to the pearl snakes, asks snakes, seeks answers on the plane of birds, raises his sight to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
In the end, the brain is asking the world.
Relatively often speaking to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical vases all memories, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This forest is logically and emotionally exposed and branching of information trees, memory registers, using the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly variable presence, in an intimate effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important communications.
Sometimes there's overload disorder.
Analogically - as if you'd fall off the PC, from the speaker and translation program from foreign languages, you'd get caught first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few failed restarts ended in a dark green-blind biosu screen, in a basic system that manages functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and operational memory etc.
For those who haven't understood what the talk is about, I'm talking about a psychospirital crisis.
You mention her often - why do you care about this type of regrese regularly?
Because it's the pit.
In the context of functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, there will be a break.
Here it's good to quote Nietzsche: "He's been looking into the faint for so long until she looked into him."
It risks the feeling that a person is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "dead" and new quality.
And why do I care personally?
I will answer the parable.
Once he fell into the belly, drowning, running days, months and years, he was still drowning and reading, and the books taught him to swim - so to live.
He's become a "whisperer."
Hopefully, someone's been able to help me write a sentence like I used to help Hrabal's texts to me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
The one who cannot be told of anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the formulation process of words and sentences."
Since the early youth, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailing on Captain Nem, running around the Stínadles in the dark streets.
In the end, behind all the branches of authors and their message, it is, "The sun is clear of the worlds of other Karl Hynek Máchy."
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
In the retro-reflection that can be read to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, after years, they're accidentally contacting me on the street and thanking me for helping them with my book in some of their hard life decisions.
Books are actually "life" or better said "worlds".
They are coded to letters, they have experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we wake them up, let them flow into their brains.
It's actually, in his own way, something forbidden by divine - to wake up other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is the fact that the DNA is placed in the line - according to the old demonological books we do the witch.
After the book is published - as it is - there is a chain of author readings waiting.
I remember you once loved reading.
Are you going to get back into it with joy, or do you feel different after years?
I'd rather just say that today.
And what did I find out about it?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic sign - they're insecure, they're too unrecognizable, they have friendly radiation, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived there was (and I hope that he still lives) one cunning bookmaker (the name is conveniently July), a happy friend and a good girl bull.
In one drunken thing, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houski.
I looked in their eyes, and then he was shown to me a crushed, readful specimen of my book.
In my embarrassment, I just postponed a detached shelter and cried a little manly.
We all stood there, we smothered, and the drunks were tearing up.
Then the young blonde mischief couldn't hold it, and with the scream jumped out of the window into the snowflake.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the nightland and slaughter a happy angry sensitivity, a painful soul of the landscapes and a steak of the patriots - spilled and scouted like werewolves until morning.
Every book of yours is formally different from the previous ones.
Does it also apply to the texts of the wind, darkness, the presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale of one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of a human healer the words of one old Russian bay: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's dogs on it, gray trunks on it.
Terrible, scary, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we used to be the devils in hell and draw the role we're going to play on this country.
Are you going to continue writing, or are you going to leave it on a free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Marchin.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamed, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desires from such depth and in such a width, that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we do exactly with self-awareness in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded by the flow of dopamine, the mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to burn, we die in defense and gain new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disorder and we'll be compassionate.
Only then we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disturbances, standing on the coast of the ocean unconscious, and into the spiral sails made of a dirty pocket catches the flows of the flange wind.
I have to write so that I can be human.
Obama's stepping away from health care
After the wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his frequently repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With appeals to hundreds of thousands of statements of statements from the Republican providers in recent days, they accused the President of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama slipped away from his original vow.
“The great majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them,” said Boston.
With regard to what he called “the distraction in the media” of statements, Obama invited the Americans who received these notifications to search for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care programme at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
Its administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the law of care available.
"I tell these Americans to be honest: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who is supervising the implementation of the law for care available, said that the start of the Internet market has been "heavy" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The irritated Sebelius this sentence, which was captured by the on-line microphone yesterday, said to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who also had to be involved in the Obam's care program.
More than three hours during the hearing at Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architekt” of the law on the available care has not volunteered by the government of the sponsored insurance, and has not purchased the program through HealthCare.gov, which is now in force to millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you going to call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and, according to the various resources of the agencies and behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The notification of the transaction should come in November, probably before the start of the auction of the frequency for the LTE network, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
It was under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, released to the auction of the frequency for the LTE network.
And to the general surprise, until then, the taste of the company to penetrate into telecommunications has not been spoken.
But Sazek now leads a very experienced telecommunications maze Robert Chvátal.
He started as a marketing manager of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and then led the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Saska plays a few cards at the same time.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admitted she wanted to run a virtual at Vodaphone.
And it gives logic.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move already existing customers from his own virtual operator.
It would probably not like Vodafon in normal circumstances, but according to the information of the Economics newspapers, this could be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement of the competitive O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner like that.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE network tension (as a rookie can auction specially specified spectrum), Vodafone must not be released in the auction at all, it will not be disregarded by a limited spectrum draining (not enough frequency for everyone).
For Vodafone can share the network with Sazba.
Vodafone will release Sazku to its 2G/3G network (respective of the newly built LTE network on the frequency of 900 MHz), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
The sachet between this will start building a costly LTE network that will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The saved money could then spend Vodafone for a fixed internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (slovak branch is a daughter of Czech) immediately obtained a full operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big pier waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would get Kellner for O2 and very likely in synergies with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared to share networks.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And since next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobil, Kellner or Komárek.
Aneb two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will the Czech TV ever pass without signature events?
President Zeman entered the era with a legendary scene with a dumpster, and so it's not hard to listen to the complaints gathered by evidence of the harassment of the castle type.
In the past, the traditional influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Hardík was not documented in such a way, let alone sign it.
That's right, the headquarters have come in.
However, the cases described do not answer the question where such a favourableness of some journalists is taken - whether this is a direct order response or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of impossible empathy.
And when we assume a general deficiency, the question cannot be forgiven whether the changes in the TV ratios do not seek other, not least the impure power interests that have not yet been given an opportunity.
The truth is that those who say that in developed countries, there is no way of trying to intervene politicians.
However, the truth is that it does not mean that there are no complaints on public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
They criticise especially what they consider to be tendencies owned to them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't gotten to this civilization stage, and this is not our situation.
But it may also be in a country that thinks that it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about evil politicians and good journalists spend more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of the incredibly situation in which it reflects the behavior of many imperfect human beings.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: Presidents on the edge of the forces
It is almost the rule that in the key moments of the country the head of the state was not in such a form as to fulfil its state duty.
If T. Masaryk was physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived the end of his presidential period and the events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic opposition, the air force might fly beyond the border, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could have fled to London immediately and not be working there for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation wouldn't have a hangover to this day.
Beneš wasn't a stateman, and Munich was still in line, but in the war it began to go down the hill and in February 48 he acted according to that.
Being better on it, he could go to exile third time and break the legitimacy of the communists and their rifles.
It's too bad to talk about.
They chose him to "Mr. President can't get into a situation he'd make a decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision made with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office was probably not.
Séf Intelligence František Moravec in the last days in March 1939 said what everything should be done to make the occupations he knew of exactly for the day, did not do to the Germans so smoothly and with such profits.
The Senial President and the cowardly government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human wreck of Gottwald had his flightmates executed, as Moscow commanded him.
Louis Freedom has ultimately failed to participate in standardization and had to settle it, already completely senile.
That Hussák was a helpless and sick depressing old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only positive.
Havel was lucky not to meet him in the office for the last few years, he was spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still fresh tennis pensioners, many of his causes are aware that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now here's this.
The head of the state and the Chief of Armed Forces looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, the external threat of the Republic is now not at risk.
Or maybe it threatens, it's just not that visible.
Then the question is if it is exceptionally (from a historical point of view) good that the president is not entirely at the strength.
It's not normal, though.
Can't we choose the president in this country once again someone acceptablely thoughtful and acceptablely healthy?
Remote planets, black and white films or a little fantasy about alien life on the ground are not topics that a American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw up ice-byly.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6th, in the great Prague Luserna Hall, will complete this year's season of Struna's festival in autumn, which is all related to everything.
The quartet of the jazz saxonist Wayne Shorter is the momental feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues are supposed to play what they're about to experience.
They treat music as completely improvised chamber affairs and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
This principle, however, is a freshly 80-year-old Shorter, an extraordinary composer, a carrier of nine Grammy, former colleague of Milese Davis, and today, apparently, the largest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
They don't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80s, I learned that it is best to let life be surprised.
"There's too many people planning everything, and then they're disappointed when things work out differently," says Shorter.
How insects from Thailand lifted the trades of the Paris bar
You may be licking yourself over the insect while you don't know that you eat it completely voluntarily about half a kilo a year.
For example, muddy in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutritional and unique experience you have also taken care of.
The offer of insects was first placed in Paris on a menu of his business at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, cook and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, for whose name was the inspiration of the book William Burroughs Naked lunch, would be found in fashion 18 district near Montmartra a generously visited tourists.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, the guests can eat not only different larvaes, cobyles or water bugs, they can taste the scorpions.
Carefully and specially packed supplies (for insects to not damage the wings, do not hurt their legs or do not harm their eyes) to Daviron send up from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, and it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneer menu immediately shows a few reasons why to consume insects.
The first is an environmental benefit, because insect production is far less expensive for our planet (which affects finances, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"Morely insect is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for the Reuters station.
At the same time, young cook does not deny his profession, he simply wants to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant a pleasure, feeling sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I don't limit the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would probably get the idea of eating a broom decorated with pest, but the responses of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects are very positive according to the owner.
Even sceptics will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest scorpion and eventually choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates are between five and nine euros.
President of the Company of Business in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings should continue
Since 2008 the Czech construction has been facing a constant decline in the volume of contracts and the interest of the State to address the issue of investment building.
Declaration of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save considerable amounts for heating after the implementation of the measure, but also for the chances for construction companies and building materials manufacturers.
Each billion invested will bring the state more than 2700 newly created jobs.
In terms of fiscal state policy, significant leverage and multiplication effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the association of entrepreneurs in construction in the Czech Republic strongly disagrees with the government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps, which would enable further continuation of the programme to be announced in its framework for further challenges.
PRAVO, 1 November 2013
The dog summarized the carpet, the president dug up and ended up with the barrels.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed and left on the Lane castle.
In what condition is he in?
In the unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that the American spy “has gone too far.”
John Kerry suggested that the US's defensive position on his follow-up programs and said in unprecedented confession that, in some cases, the spy was “going too far.”
The Foreign Minister also acknowledged that Barack Obama was responsible for the fact that, in view of the scrutiny of NSA's spy activities, which appeared through informant Edward Snowden, they acted as "autopilot".
Public information caused a diplomatic storm between the American government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, through a video-connection to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been made of the art, because that was the possibility, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of cold war, and then of course, September 11th.”
So he became the first highly built member of the American government who admitted that the American spy crossed the line, but stressed that it was not breached by anyone’s rights.
He said: “In some cases it went too far.”
And the president is determined to try to explain it to people and clarify it and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there is abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA is seeking good and that its tracking operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves away. ”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is firmly determined to kill and throw people up and attack governments.
What if you could catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented the planes from falling, the buildings did not explode, and the people were not executed, because we can learn about these plans forward.
The Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs on Thursday said that American legislators are going to Europe to respond to the concerns of abroad relating to alleged American spying and convinced the Europeans that they need to continue to join their forces in combating terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he spoke to the members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and that he was concerned about their threats that he would stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because they were distracted by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe stays with us on a single ship, taking into account the joint efforts to combat terrorism, said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the President of the Chamber sub-Committee of Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to collaborate with terror, notwithstanding their anger over the NSA programmes.
Reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some American allies, although the head of the Agency said this week they were inaccurate and reflected in the misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was following the German Chancellor's mobile phone and 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended allies as necessary and said it was from both sides of the common matter.
In the middle of the ulcer Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and he hopes that both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of other legislators who intend to engage should be published in the next days.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the aim of the journey is to help correct relations, he added that they would also be prepared for “the well-being of training measures”.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people in terms of spy programmes that they use for years.
"When we modify our monitoring programmes to protect European rights, they must also realise that we are not the only ones doing spying here," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is headed to the Middle East this weekend and to Poland to respond to inviolence, already triggered American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American monitoring activities.
The Australian appealed against the stay in Thai prison.
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15-day prison on the island of Phuket, when she untruely claimed to be attacked by a taxi driver, she appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused of the earthly court in Phuket on 15 June when the Thai police said that the tax driver and the other two men who held her were attacked in the morning on Sunday 10 June.
However, the record later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she knew she was making up an event.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a remedy facility with low security on the periphery in Phuket, instead of being placed in jail for adult women.
She is the daughter of a former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera in the case of his daughter.
Tunks told the Sidney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had a "extreme concern" for her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
“It is clearly a difficult period, but we hope that he will return safely to us as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 bahts.
In the meantime, Australia reports states that she spent holidays in the Krabi recreation area in the south of Thailand.
The legal resources in Thailand claimed that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was told to have a warning that appeal could lead to a court proceedings that would increase her punishment and lead to the location of adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct the image, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.
The yoger joked, "Gal out of the glass"?
He's got a knock in the defense zone and no one's ever caught it.
In addition, he changed the escape after a fast forhend cliff.
Jaromír Jagr scored that against Tampa at Wednesday at night, on Thursday night, then 119. winner goal in NHL commented on the Facebook social network.
"After looking at this video, my agent Petr Svoboda contacted the director of the Czech Roads and asked him if I wasn't interested in making an ad on their most modern train, Pendolino!" wrote on the introduction with oversight of Jagr.
They say we're kind of like each other.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit my night training so I don't get any faster.
"Because I'm afraid that the Minister of Defense could then be called, and he would like to make a commercial for jets!" he joined the laughter.
In addition, New Jersey has signed a second victory in a row.
"and most importantly, you noticed, Maria Rottr's treatment is working," Jagry closed.
Place of election candle guláš
The October elections rather than the winners brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties that have not even reached the House (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally also the CSSD due to their internal breakdown.
The politicians, instead of the holiday candles, served us on the election guláš weekend.
The electoral jumper became Andrei Babiš's movement, which promised voters to change the current political style of rulership.
The fragmentation of the election outcome and the victorious part of the victorious record the political (from) will of President Milosh Zeman, regardless of the wish of voters who have publicly supported the party President Zeman, nor have they chosen the House of Members.
The President, though, lost a strategic lead in front of other politicians because of the unpleasant event, but there are several other ways to get it back - such as the choice of the future Prime Minister.
While the CSSD's chances of getting the premier chair in my eyes are far away, the entrepreneurs of Andrei Babiš are approaching.
While the election development is, for a mile away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the ČSSD government supported by Communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is only a better report.
In view of the loud resistance ANO to assemble with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most probable variant of the CSSD coalition, ANO and KDU-ČSL (total 111 Members).
In view of the gap in the ČSSD, which has become an invisible and weak particle in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition may be sufficiently contamination for the ČSSD.
The Minority Government of the ČSSD, composed of the "nelanders" in Hrad, probably won't pass.
In addition, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by unsatisfactory ambitions of many Social Democrats, which can lead to a further breakdown on the side sooner or later.
So I ask myself, "Do we not succeed ourselves in the premature elections?"
Other elections would rather be a referendum on the strength of the voter's mandate, yes.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, the increase in income taxes or the construction of a state bank have fallen under the table.
On the contrary, ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and dawn agree, for example, to promote business support, to moderate fiscal policy (government deficit under 3% of GDP), to promote employment of disadvantaged persons, to lower VAT rates for selected goods.
The third areas are most present in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but he's on top now, so the program is the most probable coalition ANO, ČSSD, KDU-CSL would rather be on the right.
Which, from my point of view, is a better result than a left-handed tax program on everything that is still moving in the economy.
