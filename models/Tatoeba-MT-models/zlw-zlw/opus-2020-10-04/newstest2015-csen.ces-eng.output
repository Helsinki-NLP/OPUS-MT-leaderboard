Coming through to the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can just jump through the transfer window and make a big passage.
Another chance comes in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently a substitute goalkeeper Chelsea, but now he doesn't stand up for a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in a laughing NH Hotel, talks to Czech journalists and is going with the Czech representation on a game general with Americans and then also at the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifications against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's brance, the Prime Minister League is preferable to Thibaut Courtois, Czech for the first time in ten years in the London Club.
A while ago, it speculated that the Real Madrid might be interested in Bohemia.
He lost his Spanish SuperCup in the fights with the Athletic and couldn't even get into the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also discussed the interest of Paris SG.
By the French league season, he replied two wins and two draws, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
The AS Monaco is the most pressing bot club.
He's got 1-1-2 balance in the league so far, and on the weekend he broke up with Lille with measurable 1:1.
On the Bulgarian English websites today, the news was that Bohemia might want to be at Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookmakers, Chelsea's departure is not very likely at the last minute.
Skybet wrote 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll change your jersey in the last few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's nothing 100% in football.
Maybe during the day, there's a offer that won't say no.
What would she have to look like?
"Well, I don't know how a offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
It would have to be a match of all sides, first of all, would matter at Chelsea's position, whether the club would have dealt with or not.
Is it technically possible to make such a move when you're in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new place?
I didn't think about it that way.
But in a situation like this, there are a lot of players today, everybody's somewhere at the reunion, and I'm sure there's still a lot of cross-ups today.
So somehow realistic it would be.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
I really don't know.
So you're not pushing it out?
The situation I didn't catch in the first three games of the new season is new for me after 15 years of career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and go away.
I want the Chelsea's goalkeeper's position to continue to participate, and he's on the coach he's picking out what he's gonna do in the next weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
Considering all factors.
Of course, it's a sports aspect for me, but I'm looking at it also from the personal site, in which the needs of the family, of course, belong.
Is it possible that you'd catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought he'd never be concerned about me.
But there's anything in football.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.

The renewal of a very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect the unions as civil law.
"According to how unions work, work for the middle class," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, co-president of the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud that I can, along with the pattern of occasional rights, present John Lewis the law that strengthens the position of employees.
This breakthrough legislation gives workers the same legal options to defend discrimination in unions, such as other forms of discrimination - and to stop counter-brand forces
Edit the law on employment relations to allow all employees who are facing discrimination if they want to engage in unions, judge themselves in civil court - and judge compensation or damage compensation - is a right and necessary initiative.
I'm sure it's not a radical initiative - at least not according to the American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other suggestors in the law are to re-establish to the American ideal.
Despite the union fights that have occurred in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - the Americans once supported countries worldwide to adopt, extend and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans are still remembering when the country was one breath to promote democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to collect.
When the United States took over Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the Hideki Toja military autocracy will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in forming a new Japan, included their language and openly recognised that “the right of employees to gather, negotiate collectively and be guaranteed to act.”
When the United States took over Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution that ensures that the fascist of Adolf Hitler will be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organise and promote themselves in the new nation, and that is why they included a clause that openly says: “The law to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
The arrangements which limit this right or will seek damage will be abolished. Measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Committee on Human Rights, which proposed the General Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the applicants and the Roosevelt guarantee included them that “every has the right to create and enter unions in the protection of their interests.”
The Americans for generations have accepted the basic prerequisite that labour rights are human rights.
When the countries advised other countries to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in an equivalent partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote in free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions of the forces of the nation did not reduce, but they spread it.
They have increased the living standards of millions of people, created a market for industry and production to an indispensable level.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but the history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't either.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that brought up America and made a true promise to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could have closed all abortive clinics in Louisiana
The Federal Judge temporarily blocked the Louisian law on Sunday, which, according to the lawyers, would probably close all five abortive clinics in the state.
The regulation concluded by the signature of the Luisian Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors carrying out abortions to be entitled to accept a patient in the hospital within 30 miles from their practice.
The resolution of the Judge means that doctors may temporarily continue to implement legal abortions and, in the meantime, have to deliver this authorisation.
"The suggesting party will be able to act legally, and in the meantime it will obtain a permit," states the federal judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge may issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to abort the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that it would provide more time for doctors to obtain authorisation.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana will be safe from the underlying law to prepare them for health and their rights," said Nancy Northupová, President and Executive Director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, which, on behalf of the three of the five clinics, urged to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics that were not among the applicants, and also requests for authorisation.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have approved similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures to be contradictory.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state would block a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abort along with the Association of American midwifes and gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have that authorisation lays down requirements for doctors that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Opposers of abortions were opposed by measures aimed at protecting women's health and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of measures.
The Reproduction Rights Centre stated that in Louisiana only one abortive physician has permission.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop the abortion, this doctor would also stop worrying about their safety, said the group.
The Louisiana authorities in response indicated that they would not have obtained doctors who are arriving in abortion while waiting for an application for rights to be made.
Because of late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment kills more often on rural ovarian cancer
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with a hold of their dead mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in Australia are at risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records over 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of five years after diagnosis were alive.
The head of research, Susan Jordan, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, stated that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent higher probability that they would die during the study than in women in urban areas.
MALÁ STUDIE: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Women's researchers followed seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed in advanced stages.
For women in rural and remote areas, about 20 percent higher probability was that they would die during the study than for women in urban areas.
Although the study has not been designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynecooncologues, who are usually located in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving medical services on a distance to overcome the barriers in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen the transport service that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programmes to support people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that long-term survival of ovarian cancer women was irrespective of the geographical location, which underlines the necessity of better treatment and preventive programmes.
The research financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will publish the Medical Journal of Australia today.
In March 2012, young mother Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive form of ovarian cancer in her 33 years.
Garden centres regret lowering the number of owners of homes
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decline in connection with the extraordinary incapacity of home owners under 35 could lead to that, until today's young generation of consumers reaches the "main age group of gardeners", garden centres will lose up to 10 million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on average 55% of the amount they spend in their own people.
As other factors that threaten the sector, which earns an estimated £5 billion per year, the increase in the number of people living in very urban areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of detention instead of the front gardens used as a parking area and a smaller size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of houses owned has declined over six years from 61% to 43%, the lowest household expenditure for garden products in Britain falls.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society indicated that housing in a lease or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden consultant for the RHS, said: “The tenants are very popular planting in the florals - when they move, they can bring plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "Golden Age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of home owners and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also foretold a higher residency for this year thanks to better weather that came after unfavourable conditions in March and April.
When the east dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me of Hitlerjugend most of all, he rescued atomic weapons and basically showed everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and it is that they can control both nacionalism, and that a complex of minority can transform into imperialism.
The time goes east probably different than the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war on the domination of Europe was long gone, in the east they thought they had been overlooked for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis had captured power, and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the completely consistent cult of a strong leader, the beaten of journalists, the liquidation of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that's really similar.
Vladimir Putin and most of the Russians probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part shattered before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians have committed themselves, perhaps few Vladimir screamed on his shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him to where he wanted it, and maybe they underestimated him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
You made order at home, faced that he didn't want anywhere, and he wiped at home knives.
Now he's decided he's going back to the lost position.
It'll start slowly, he's got time.
The leader is probably for life, so where he'd be in a hurry.
He went through the Caucasians, now he's going to go down the Ukrainians, then the dwarfs from the Baltic.
Those Russian bears have been stinging in the fur long enough.
I'm sure that's what China will notice, who's kind of jumping up too much, and he's definitely looking out for the far East.
And the Germans of the Vladimir are also pretty hard on how well they are, and I put that on their ass in 45.
Let's do one new Novorosiu in Karlovy Vary.
It would be a base, and ours is a lot there, and as they're squeezing them up there, they're already trying to break them off.
For our veterans are remembering how Czechoslovakia was in it.
Well, then, their Prime Minister Gospodin Saturday, he's so soft, he can be robbed like onions and eat the whole EU.
That would be the way they'd be playing big Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And as a detonator, we'll use our dentists who live in their territory.
The Russians are enough everywhere, and when they say they're pushing them there, they're just squeezing them and we're not gonna let them, we're gonna protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, for what else is born to.
Europe is only good as a predator that Ivan proudly dances goats.
Turkey called for an American diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called for the most built American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the US charge d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.

According to Turkish media, the Turkish President of Recep Tayip Erdogan had the significance of the report and declared that all important states were being followed.
The older report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, has caused a more disgruntled response to the Turkish government.

Police Director in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the City Hall in Calvia’s Government.
The director of the police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested for the charges brought by the entrepreneur and the owner of the bars in an unfair party district in Magaluf.

"It's not about making money long ago, but about survival," said one of the businessmen in court.
Don't mess with our living.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got on the main page of magazines all over the world after youTube appeared a video of 18-year-old British tourists who provided oral sex to 24 men during the tour of the bars.

The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, was also witnessed by many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including fashion waves known as “balconing”, where people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day recorded by rain and storms that had an impact on the airport in Adelaide
JARO brought south South Australia ice surprises, came with a strong rain and a sharp wind that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm precipitation is to fall in town until 9 o'clock in the evening, and the next 6,6 mm will be spent in the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with several short excesss associated with the storm and wind porcupines that began before 8:00 p.m. and brought almost 4 mm precipitation within about 10 minutes.
After a few early spring doses last week, the temperatures in the city decreased again on Monday at just 15.8 °C.
It is considered that storm weather has contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land shortly after 19:30, but at a short distance it hit the change of the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to delay the landing.
The wind pory at the airport in Adelaide at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.

Israel’s children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israel’s children from the area near Gaza returned to school on Monday after they spent summer in the anti-bomb covers, while during the fifty-day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes missiles and minomets.
The beginning of the school brought the community to the south of Israel the recorded attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of fighting are still apparent.
In Ashdod, the city in the south of the country, the staff of the preschool that the missile hit, they removed the remains from the wall and slowly expect the return of the children.
"We have a little fear, but otherwise we are looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of kibuc Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of children from this area really need to get back to everyday routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that "it's a little strange" to go to school all of a sudden.
"We've had a few tough moments and we haven't even left the house," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer its support to the inhabitants.
Until the last week the war stopped, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or leaving their homes and went to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and minomets.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which the bullet from the Palestinian Minomet killed a four-year-old boy, he he hesitates to return.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjah visited the school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was strongly hit by Palestinian fire.
He asked the children to study hard, and he added: “We will provide you with education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
Although the stopping of fire led to the immediate termination of the fight, Hamasso did not solve the key problems as a requirement for the Israeli-egyptian Gaza blockade and the reopening of the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers fallen in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later in this month in Egypt.
According to the Palestinians and the UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questiones and estimates that at least half of the dead were radical, even though there was no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including the Thai worker, died on the part of Israel.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and missiles from minomets during the battles of Israeli cities mainly on the south of the land.
The Israeli army has again taken over 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and, by estimate, 250,000 people have been hidden in a hundred UN schools that have transformed into a provisional shelter.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who remain in hiding, and for the last week, school officials have postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that school will be opened soon so that we can complete education as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in Gaza.
I'm standing behind you.
And the Laphata suffers the temperature
The Czech Football Representation met this morning in Prague before the Wednesday preparatory match with the US and the subsequent introductory game of European Championships against the Netherlands.
Of the thirty-two-member corpse, the partner attacker David Lafat suffers from the temperature.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David probably has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible," said Coach Pavel Vrba to the journalists.
"If it's two or three days, or tomorrow it's fit, we'll see by his health condition that our doctor decides," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in a fight in the middle of the US," said Czech coach.
On Sunday night, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan Reservator Lukas Vach.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, including other midwifes.
I decided on the basis of Luke's a prospective player who's 25 years old.
The decision was very complicated, but I am behind it," said Vrb.
What about Šural?
Let's see what happens to Latatata.
It is not ruled out that in the case of health problems nomination could still change.
On the weekend, Joseph Šural, who gave hattrick, shineed with great performance.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown the form.
Let's see how David Lafata's on it.
In the event that he can't be available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I can't dominate any of the players who were interested in the Czech league," said Vrba.
This afternoon awaits a representation of the training in Strahova, on Tuesday, then a classic pre-payment training before duel with the USA on Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by the autography.
Fighting with Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15, and the national team in it will strive for the Prime Minister's victory under the Vrbo.
He played two draws in the previous three preparation matches and lost one.
Qualificational fight with the Netherlands is then on the programme of 9 September from 20:45.
Pešice is going to the Netherlands to Italy
The Vrba is happy to have more time to practice unlike previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have a player for eight days and you can practice with them certain things we don't have so much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting ready for the Netherlands as best," he commends Vrba.
The Dutch will present themselves on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally follow the former temporary representation coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information they're from the game.
But it's not just him, we're gonna have a match, we're gonna have a shot, and we're gonna talk about it.
The new coach is coming to the Netherlands, and we'll see what changes there will be," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to the very surveyed statistics, the price of apartments increased most in the winter period in the past seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital of the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased by 1.1% in August, the Agency stated on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10,9 %, more than twice per year until August 2013, but the profit was not equally distributed in the country.
The RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne run on the market.
RP numbers Data show that Sydney's apartment prices increased by 16.1% last year, while Melbourne's prices were 11.7%.
Other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an average price increase between five and six percent.
On the other hand, the scale was placed by Canberra, which damaged the State’s reduction in expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when spring started, the number of real estates will be increased in the next months, which will be a "real test for the market".
‘In view of the continuing high levels of auction sales, the overall high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase during the next three months,’ said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hired me.
He never said to me, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, who worked in the factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a “precedented” therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - they went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass with beer or beauty of a cricket.
I never spoke to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner reading newspapers.
Recently, Henry visited Dudley's sleeve, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he saw what life had to be for him.
There's a little more light today, but it's still dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth, where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and betting.
My dad always got in the tub, and he was just lying there, and then it was heard how he slowly starts singing for himself, because he was was washing a snack.
When I walked around, I realized he'd been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hire anyone. He said, "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, who she and Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, who was married to 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't we be friends with Dawn?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight and started showing symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said: “You must make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And fatigue.
No one wants to eat carrots.
Change in the direction of taking Henry's career may reflect in his elegant, short-cut nipples.
After he got acknowledged from criticism for his Othella, he went to the theatre.
She followed Komedia full of mistakes and August Wilson's plocies.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that resulted in his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage, when he parodized someone, and wrote about him in New Faces' talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “I've been the only black player/committee in television for a long time.”
He learned the march.
Besides having to notice me, I had to learn how to invent working jokes, be a star and perform on TV, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the right to stage production The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which the actors dressed as black, Henry finally performed his comedy in it for five years.
My family's been uncomfortable about that.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years appreciated by the main product of British television,” but was also the “grotesque parodie of black people.”
In the '80s, Henry worked in alternative comedyal circles and introduced figures that also made amazement and celebrated the British black culture.
The first series The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s he was also known as chef Gareth Blacklock in a comedy series Chef!.
For the next decade he took advertising, papers, television shows and movies, but after sending his show to the BBC in 2008, he said, "What you're gonna do now, Lene, it's kind of like you're stuck in one place, or you're out of the way."
Next was the documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn him at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othell's final speech for the document, and he's already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me the courage.
"That's the point. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard, and before I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It seemed like there was trouble waiting, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Komedia full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctly felt that he had to take responsibility for confiscating the audience.
“The voice in the head said to me: “Do not fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.”
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem solves.
I left the stage, and there was something in me, saying, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Learning Plots text was a challenge.
Panic's pretty good, delivers determination.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like a divine sign that says, “You should do this.”
Of course, he says it by his voice.
So I'm staying with that.
I really like it.
I like the test room.
Yet, Henry remains a comedian's brain - our conversation has been interrupting the humorous performances when he enters and stands out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it anymore.
I asked if he ever organized a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps to give the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to light on existing employees
Kenya began with biometric registration of all its state officials in order to try to remove from the payment list of the government of the non-employed.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register will cease to receive a payment in the next two weeks.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after the state service has left.
After he took over the office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatt promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the State is losing at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on the payouts of no employees and on the next abuse of official power.
The government suspects that the salaries are continued to be paid on bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the employee leaves the state administration, said the BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All state officials have to enter the identification centres in the next two weeks where their data are biometrically recorded shall be entered in the declaration of the government.
He also says that anyone who does not come without a sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
“According the actual public service employees, this measure will contribute significantly to its granting and will also be used to cleanse the payment list at both levels of the government, and thus solve the problem of the existing employees,” said Anne Waiguru, the secrets of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested for the “spirit” against the government
The local media states that 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the “conspiration against the government.”
The police office hasn't commented yet.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 highly built officials were held.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for alleged organizing a criminal gang and phone listening.
The Turkish President of Recep Tayyip Erdogan (in that time the Prime Minister) identified their conduct as part of the Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine were reopened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the Prime Minister of Arseni Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools have reopened, but that the country is determined to defend for the next generation:
Not in all schools, a traditional ceremony was held on September 1.
Not all Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, a connected Ukrainian line, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, visiting Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be reached here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the children dressing up shirts, bringing balloons and teachers give flowers.
In Rona Fairhead, she may have found BBC's boss for hard times.
He brings with him a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal conclaves of conservative parties.
She has the experience of the front lines.
The career began in Bain and Co consultant company, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
Seven years she was the Executive Director of the Financial Times, resigned to the office when she had the highest function in Pearson's parent company.
It's said that her distance has reached a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, former CEO of BP, when Cameron needed a private expert in Whitehall: she became a government counselor.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a pool with poison.
Not only is the BBC extensive and confused entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning two directions: inside the top layer of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also outside the voice of the public in times of restlessness when things do not work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
Which director would risk coming to a company complex as a Chinese dynasty, spread it, and thus prepare himself for his own work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't that hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC dropping down - her power, her finances - and how she's revising her status.
With the expansion of the circle of competition and the new technology questioning old certainty, the immediate negotiations on concessionary fees for BBC brings great dangers.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media firm in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production is 96% of households and each costs only 40 pens a day.
Moreover, the popularity of the BBC is evidently rising: to 53% of the favourers compared to 31% of ten years ago.
Models of using the BBC services have changed: Today the newspaper titles are displayed on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can look at the iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to remain a very loving and wonderful institution.
He needs a wonderful director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says the offensive tweet did not approve
The Tweet of the official Twitter account of the Governor of Texas Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained an insulting picture of the Democratic State Attorney initiating Perry's criminal charges for abuse of powers.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account, distancing from the previous one.
The tweet that wasn't authorised was out of my account.
"I disagree with tweet and withdraw it," said in the next post.
Perry's assistants have not answered the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
Previous tweet published an unlimitable, humorous picture of the state's attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to ruling in drunkenness in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the payment of funds for her office, which Perry, the possible candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before the grand jury in Austin.
The label in tweet said: “I'm not always driving with three times the level of alcohol in my blood than the permitted limit... but if so, I'm suing Governor Perry for calling me to be responsible.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Perry's investigation didn't run Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was assigned to the Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and accused by a tactic, political manoeuvre.
His qualified legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the charges, because the use of laws to prosecute the most longest governor in Texas history is contradictory.
Perry canceled the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Department of Defense of Public Interest, which is located in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's promising.
After he ended in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012 at the fifth place in his committee, Perry replied to speculation that he could already end, tweet with his own picture, as he runs near the lake, and with the words: “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns to normal
One of the most prominent development companies in London warned that the housing market in the southeast of England “returned” to normal level of activity.
Residence in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and extended concerns about credit bubbles brought in June Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developer company for demanding customers Berkeley, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point of 2013 has returned to a normal level of transactions.”
The London housing market managed well during the decline, because the main city was flooded by buyers from abroad.
According to the catastrophic data, only in the last year, the prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, thereby far prevailing the average of 6.7% in England and all in Wales.
Average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley increased by about five last year, and at the end of April they climbed to £423,000.
However, because of strengthening libře, foreign buyers of London are not so attractive in recent months - some of them also intimidated the introduction of new real estate taxes and talks about possible "sídlo taxes", with which politicians came before parliamentary elections next May.
The London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow down the rate of market growth in real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data Bank of England showed a decrease in the volume of approved mortgages for July on Monday, which suggests that the housing market is calmed.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, has decreased on the basis that home prices have already started to decline, its forecast of growth in London's real estate prices for 2015 to 3%.
According to WA Ellis, the volume of transactions has been reduced by quarters each year in London's most expensive quarters such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Yet, the demand for housing in the capital of Berkeley was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sale to more than 2,2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The question after the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same and thus maintained the forward sale.”
In June, the company announced that, from the beginning of the year to the end of April, she sold 3,722 properties, almost a third more than before the 2007 crisis.
The annual profit before tax increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £ 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of Pidgley, Pidgley said that it was foreseen that the annual revenue of Berkeley would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £ 450 million.
Berkeley's stock stopped at the London stock exchange in 23,96 libra.
Hacker published photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Award of the Academy.
The pictures of Oscar Jennifer Lawrence's holder escaped online because of the hacker who claimed that he had “a list of” photos of another hundreds of actresses starting.
The speaker of the stars of the "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos are true and the hacker criticized for “a apparent violation of privacy.”
The authorities have already been contacted and will be prosecuted by anyone who's taking pictures of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker photographs that were originally published on the server for image sharing 4chan, allegedly received the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who are looking at the photos that we and my husband took in private home have been happy with each other," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known of the series of cable TV Nickolodeon “iCarly” and “Victorious”, however, denies that the photos would be real. On Twitter, she said: “There are my alleged naked photos underVRH, people.”
It's better to squeeze it in the riot.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs were true.
Extraordinary demonstration from the praised new novel of Howard Jacobson about love and letter “J”
They're dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they're gradually spreading up as a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, complicated, sharp, isolated, and maybe a little awkward.
And then she shakes his hand.
He admitted it in distress.
He could fuck like a jewel, yes.
The last victim of his abilities was the beginning of a love plea, which more than usually promised to relieve him from a lonely life bore, and maybe even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild heat of hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and inhostinct than Port Reuben.
On the south, she came with an elder companion who thought Kevern was her aunt who inherited property in a wet, but a wonderful valley called, conveniently, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The trunks were dry, dead spiders were in the vans, the spiders were slim on the windows, as if they thought they belong to them, the garden was grown, and the weeds reminded the huge guts of the greens.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Profile of author: Howard Jacobson, whose nomination “J” is on the preliminary list of nomination at Man Booker Prize 2014.
A closer choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on the seating chairs in long grass and holding their hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, imitating a public station, which covered with comforting music and calming news, when the view of her burned crossed legs reminded the old song of a long forgotten black comedian who loved to listen to his father with the blinds.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, they never played such songs in radios.
They weren't forbidden - really forbidden was nothing - they just didn't play.
They helped them get into a desuetud, just like the word desuetudo itself.
The human taste has proved what they would never prove to be a rule and a position outside the law, and as well as the people, as regards books, choose the memorials in which poor man becomes rich, cooks and love novels, so in music they choose ballads.
The Cavern was letting down the day and started playing on an imaginary piano and rough, singing a comic voice to Aillin's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
“It was a favorite song from the jazz pianoist Fatse Waller,” he said, and he automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter "j" before he got out of his mouth.
It started like a game when he was little.
Father told him he played a game with his father.
When you started with the word "j", you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny that time, and it wasn't funny anymore.
He just knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, even though he wasn't directly built outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvisation came out of fashion.
There was a place in life only for one “if.”
When she started playing melody, people wanted to know exactly where she was gonna end up.
The same in humor.
His unpredictableness went to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed by a song.
Even though he didn't hear about Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, he knew Kevern jazz from his father's semi- secret collections of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember the time when the favorite singers weren't black.
And without laws or pressure.
A slow society is in which each part of her with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were happy by chance of saving - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Carib origin with temperament and constitution were thrown for fun and athletics, and they were singing and running.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if the nature of electronics, have taken responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The cops left were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed washing the dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf and Levanta, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while they were doing what they had done, COULD DIDS TO STALO - they were afraid to accuse them of putting them into the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would spend them next time -- they opened up a restaurant where the labneg and smoked water pipes, didn't notice themselves, and they were slowly eating them.
Every man according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn hardly understood how the rude words Kavern just sang on her could create music.
Music was the expression of love.
“In fact, they are not rude,” Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden delivered the illusion of safety.
The soundproof leaves couldn't escape a word.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he wouldn't mind having two fingers back to her mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
“She seemed funny to him,” he finally said.
She shattered her head incredibly and shook Kevern's view.
There was nothing more to see in the wide world than to make her hair hammering.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not exactly.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said to her, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me," he tried.
I'm kind of perverted.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked a spell necessary to be able to break the cruelty that he had in the jokes.
Maybe his father was deliberately cruel.
Maybe he was a deliberately cruel Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons got red and woke out of the crib, dropped the radio and spilled the unsafe wine.
Wineless, so the drink wasn't worth it.
She looked like she was shaking like palm leaves in a storm in her distress.
"I'm sickly attracted to being a jerk," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her miserable words and fear that she had in her eyes at the moment she stood up against him.
She thought she was gonna hit?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt it was the same in the foundation.
It was the same broad and ice ocean.
The same deranged men, then, CO SE STLO, even more distrust and irritating than their ancestors, smugglers and the worlds, were angry from the pub to the pub, ready to draw their hand on any woman who would dare to refuse or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to anoint it - to anoint it became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibodies of a young ballad about the love that the radio shredded - first they anointed it, then hit her one.
According to Kevern’s view, excessive cultivation was a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons never told him to leave.
He got up from the crib like an old man.
She was feeling sick, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She looked at her leaving - like she was watching him out the window on the floor - a man who caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart's shut down because of him and all the men in general, no matter how many of them beat her up.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hanged, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember the only moment until today that she'd ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, again alone, looked at her legs.
Approximately 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and thrilled 20-year-old researchers working in Ofnow, a non-security monitoring system of public mood, prepared a short article on the continuation of light and medium-sized violent acts in the areas of the country where its mitigation or direct stopping, most expected to have been spent enough money and energy to remove it.
“They have done a lot and have to do,” wrote, “to calm down the birth aggression of people who fought in many battles and most of them have won, especially in the dreadful, difficultly accessible places of the country, where, despite the top of the church towers, the breaths of human kindness appeared rarely in history.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It could seem that the higher the church tower is, the lower the puddles are.
Residents breathe over sentimental ballads, deny unhappy stories, and declare that they believe firmly in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in the rustic areas old brutality keeps as hard as in urban agglomerations, but also evidence shows that at home, in the workplace, roads, and even in sports field, new and violent invincence appear.
"God has the tendency to a very delicate style," the superior said.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer this," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme replaced her right to privacy and silence again.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I therefore do not ask,” said Rabinowitz, “I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unconnected companies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and commendable, may sometimes distort judgments as you have done.
Obviously, you yourself are preconnected to the Church - the things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also interpret others as an expression of natural power and energy.
Still to deal with what happened yesterday, if it happened, he prepares the country with her basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
His head on the light board was pinkly flashing recommendations that Ofnow sent to the world of the last quarter or more.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, singing word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
“I completely understand your reservations,” she answered silence Esme Nussbaum when she was sure that her superior ended, “and I am no longer saying that the morning did not heal as we argued that she was healing.
In particular, my concern is that if we are not alerted to this earlier, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what we did, if we were not aware of it before.
But this time, we're not going to be raged and trustworthy on the others.
Luther Rabinowitz connects finger hobby.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
“You are going too far,” said, “when the steps that may have been done and perhaps your grandparents did not do, you describe as mistakes.
You're also taking too far in talking about having their "suffer" and "deficiency" on the "other."
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting the presence we are not talking about "ours" and "these."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is it was a chaotic time.
“By which, if we are sincere to each other,” Esme took the courage, “we are no one guilty.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to say, we agree on this.
And as well as there is no fault that could be seduced on someone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if corrections were appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past but to learn from it -
The past exists to forget it.
If there's anything I can add to this--
Luther Rabinowitz disconnected finger hobby.
"I will take your report into account," said and released.
The day when she went to work, she was hit by a biker who drove on a sidewalk in a way that the perimeter described as "brutal and furious."
There are accidents.
The Army of the Lesothy Kingdom claims that no puk plans - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesothy denied that they would have organized a puncture in order to reverse the government, claiming that they were opposed to the police from attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country and said that the army was surrounded by his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
After he declared he was threatened by death, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighboring Republic of South Africa.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's spokesperson said that it wasn't really about the puke, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police tried to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defendants of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several information service reports that there are several groups that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to make the land of the trigger,” said the voice of America.
The Speaker of the South African government, Clayson Monyel, said military action looked like attempted to reconcile the government.
"But no one has declared that the government's power was taken by force, it seems that the actions of the forest-defense defence forces are carried by the sign of the state reverse," he said.
The Military Representatives of the Kingdom of Lesothy said that the soldiers returned to their cascades on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that according to his opinion, the target of the attack is for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the Parliament's meeting for internal disputes, the tension in Lesoth has been held.
He declared that, despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his conduct to the government.
Manufacture in the euro area is at the 13-month minimum
The increase in production was slowed to a minimum of 13 months according to the carefully monitored survey in the euro area in August.
The final index of the purchase managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell in August to 50.7.
Higher than 50 means expansion.
New orders and factory damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The numbers are from the quarterly European Central Bank meeting (ECB).
The banks will want a clear plan to deal with the distant recovery of the euro area and the risk of inflation deficits at 0.3%.
The speculation was that the Director of the ECB Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that it considered the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States came to during the financial crisis.
"But at least some growth is better than no growth, a braking effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty for producers is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the main economist Markit.
The production of PMI Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the 11th month minimum of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
There's anxiety about France, Italy's gone from the expansion again the stagnation.
Signs of the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands disappeared are also not very calming," said Dobson.
The slowing industry is likely to spill oil into the fire analysts expecting further monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say is that the sector is still growing.”
He added: The producers in the euro area currently have a very complex life because the increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty to demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has been proven - especially consumer confidence, which will probably cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those expensive.
He pointed out that the ECB would have to make some form of quantitative release as “but we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of hell of survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the school occupied children still suffer
Ten years ago, the Chechen Radicals at Beslan School in South Russia were detained as hostages a thousand people
During the suffering that took three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of which were children
We came back to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the disbelief at school.
Exactly ten years after the scary obsession of the school in Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, warned survivors from the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatic terrorists and parents were captured and murdered, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance over tragedy has joined the east and west, which has led to negotiations and futures in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims that escaped death during the maturity of the school.
We found amazing young people who resisted disaster, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live in them.
What's their greatest wish?
For a war that destroys Ukraine now, and in which children like them die, it is over.
Girl trying to get back into the ruined school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer, Dimitrij Beliakov, only in the underwear trying to get back into a demolished school gym after the bomb exploded in it.
Mad Aida desperately looked for her mother Larissa, which is now forty.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
The soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had recovered fully, but yesterday she said: “The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
My knee's got scabbards left.
Its goal is to become a dentist to help people as well as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she definitely didn't destroy it," she said determined.
“This just happened to me, and that can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to friends about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate of Jar Gapoev's class killed there.
When we were little, we used to play together and imagine how we'd go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget her captivity, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and from other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see her for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from repeating.
A boy who escaped the rain of a bullet and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia the children of school begin in seven years) and survived the three-day siege of school in huging their mother Tamara.
At that time, the seven-year-old said: “Mommy told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, " Run."
He was afraid she was dead, running, and on the way he saw the crying bats, grabbed the baby's hand and ran away the shower bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me his mother was dead.”
She says: “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was struggling at freedom, lying in the hospital with a wounded leg, and she thought her son was dead.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the missing News of the World) where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," said yesterday.
But I can say the memories are already pale.
I remember dropping all my guns to play right after that.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I don't have a problem with it.
“I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I used to play in the yard that didn't get out.
We'll never say they're killed or they're dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember well on a trip to London, especially the way I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop, and as I was a cabidel.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffered as much as he and his friends have suffered because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I'm so sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror," says Damir, who took part in the monastery's volunteer work last week.
I really want to help.
One day, I want to work with the police, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence immediately after the attack, there were no children who were yelling and running here, and it took a few months to remain silent.
He's alive remembering the way with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even if it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir having a taste for borsche, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I remember also playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them from the water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And that was just a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed to better in the past ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there's been, and there's still a lot of kids going to be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people the war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are doing, what a terrible thing this is.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet kid, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care.
I know he hates to remember it, but he's very close to six schoolmates, and he goes to the gym from time to time and lights the candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch with a face turned away from us and sometimes lying hours.
He didn't sleep, he had his eyes open.
I also remember he threw all his guns or other guns to play, and Damir's 17 today, he's higher than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I've been sure he's dead for hours, and I'll never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and lifted up my legs, I looked around and saw hell, and there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have this hell of a chance to survive.
“I remember screaming “Damire, run, run!” but I was convinced that he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes unlike others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
A boy whose taken-up photo after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Consolation: Survivor from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with her mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigorij today
When he was running for life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was frightened in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school the first day and was in a hurry to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy stayed there three days alone," she recalled.
Not all alone because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigorii survived.
When the date comes, it's still harder to think about it and talk about it.
It won't take one day to remember the tragedy.
We don't think this happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigorije (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was exquisite as a statue (right)
I remember Grigori was so excited about school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he's alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of crying Grigorija in San Marino.
Grigori's not happy to look at the picture, and we have it hidden at home in the library.
I understand, but I also think that because of this picture, people in the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
A similar tragedy continues to investigate, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the crash of boeing in Ukraine.
Can we ever find out what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years are nothing for that kind of pain.
In order to forget a little, he needs tens of years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates that they killed.
That's why when it's September 1st, I'm going to the gym.
I want to worship the memory of my friends from childhood.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished my school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't do it for health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived even though they kept him at the foot of a murdering terrorist
Wonder: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but he survived
When the attack was in fullstream, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to the bomb at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Gregori, who wanted to be a Federal Security Service agent, but he couldn't have been injured during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind my head.
Now I'm older and they say that kids can deal with bad experience better - I have to say that it's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006, and I was feeling a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd love to forget.
In 2005 - year afterward - that was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with your photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I bring it with me every day.
Friends know that I don't like thinking or talking about it, and they never ask me at school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knees that I've hurt, but I'm walking normally.
But still, I couldn't get in for health and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent my papers to them, including medical reports, and they told me that it wasn't possible.
My next pleasure is animals, so I got into the veterina.
I've finished it for the second year.
He learns how to treat all the animals from “cats to cows”.
He said: “I know I will never talk about it to my children.
It's not something the kids should know about, and not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
He's inside and he's getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I'm going to take part in the reminder ceremony.
I know Grigori isn't coming.
It's got to be even stronger for him because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregori is a grown-up today, but he's got the horror going on.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unjust happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sport, but he can't do it for his knee.
He has undergone several operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that 50% of it's overwhelmed, but to overcome it completely, and you can't forget it.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors and it only makes pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and loved, and they were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts the loss of the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who were never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one of our friends country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who brought the special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaevu brings into a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten, and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all.
The world caught the breath in 2004 when a small Alyon took out of the Beslan captivity of the Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but they left her thirty-year-old mother, her 10-year-old sister, and her brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died during the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and with his new wife, the Lightlan girl named Kristina after the dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, which is now ten, doesn't remember the attack and grew out of her bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that “it’s a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father, and he wants to keep the kids away from the memories that the tenth anniversary reminds.
You can understand why.

4 tips how underwater to get better photos and videos
If you are interested in photography or filming underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a outdoor GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with some cameras, they all cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure your batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
In addition, set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimises the exposure to the dark environment underwater.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can immerse yourself with your equipment.
Some cameras are only up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluation of digital cameras in a normal and waterproof version.
Do always a few shots - a lot of them won't work out.
Comprehensive cameras have LCD, which will help you with composing photos, but outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, it will be wrong to see underwater and the frame will be unpredictable.
So always do more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure disperse, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper submarine of the light, it's far-reaching.
If possible, stay close to the level when taking pictures in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to catch more light on photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's a great advice if you take pictures on the land, but underwater, it's even more important because of the louder light.
It is especially important if you are filming with outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a strong and wide angle of the lenses, which means that if you want to fill the photo frames, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in a massive organization like NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was Officer MI6 who had to live with the consequences of torture that irritated him.
Lawson understood that while the doctors focused on diagnosis and illness, patients treated in the vicious majority are interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," wrote in May that year.
I felt no energy.
He dealt with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient, and his wife Juliet includes remorse.
He said: “I want everything to happen more sooner than later.”
When Juliet went on her business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplained.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague made him a chest X-ray.
One week before he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are here.
He had mesothelioma, unhealable tumor, which affects the burst of the lungs or if the pulmonary ventrile.
For most cancer species, it is hard to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
The mesotheliom is different.
Almost in all cases, the cause of asbestos - to the building fiber material, which has previously been referred to as “amazing,” but now it is known that it is fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it was not hard to ignore the mesotheliom.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry has entered into force.
Even when asbestos was used, there were only some groups of people in close contact with him, such as treasurers of isolation, builders, carpenters and workers in the yards.
Toxin used in industry in another era today is hard to see as a reason for fear.
Such selfishness isn't in place.
As it turns out, in Britain, the mesotheliom epidemic is at the peak of today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma here is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths of this disease per year are twice as many as the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths of mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we are now feeling its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades to develop the mesothelies.
The disaster in the form of a mesothelioma does not concern only veterans of the building industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases he is still present in homes where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in shops where we buy.
Therefore, the Mesotheliom does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged mushrooms from London's commercial homes to public school do not constitute a hiding place.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which they should treat us are the storage of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even hold the insulation.
He was trying to find out where he could have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement halls of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors and door corridors used.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he could partly answer.
“One of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital, and in whom in the past five years, the mesotheliom showed up,” said in the letter in 2010, “I am the only still alive.”
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Survival with this diagnosis is not common for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are sick of the same illness? ”
According to a leading British expert on Professor Julian Pet's mesotheliom, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain occurs, some 90,000 people die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at the files from the archives of the courts, on which disabilities often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she put Janice Allen's asbestos out of negligence.
She worked for the chain nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched in two shops on the section with clothes - one of the seats was the flagship of the company, the shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two kids who are over 20.
“ Before it happened,” he says, “I've never heard of mesotheliom before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
Never in my dreams, I never thought he might have been involved with me.
Not many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He got his name because of his fibrous structure that gives him strength and volatility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Today, chryzotil is most often found in buildings, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, fighter sealings and even in brake lining.
It is not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO still consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
However, there is a more dangerous brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos and experts claim that “there is convincing, but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of unusually high occurrence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Marsk & Spencer's employee was exposed to an asbestos in a flag shop in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pet's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study claims that “a significant part of the cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
The significant part of this exposure is caused by ‘common use and vibration’ of buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that neither people in the center of the government have to suspect that they may be exhibited asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report, according to which service elevators and pipes are contaminated by asbestos, whose fatal fibres could be damaged by something as harmless as the “silent air stream”.
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case it may be the opposite of truth.
Although Parliament Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace received a ‘possible medical certificate’, it now counts that one million pounds will need and a few years of work to be thoroughly examined by Parliament, the electricity and the asbestos has been upgraded, and that after the elections in 2015, Members will rather than sit in the green benches in Westminster at the premises of the Conference Centre of Queen Elizabeth II.
In Goddard's report, "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this dishonest will cost life.
Everyone can only wait now.
One of those who have never been able to determine when the asbestos exposure occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspected he was exposed to asbestos in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos has been proven,” he says, “but in my case, I cannot prove it.
It's difficult to remember all the places he worked, and when he worked there.
But he remembers a day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was able to grow up as a winter.
He was 45. He was in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly, I shattered.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming from a burst, lung propellers.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesotheliom.
In the end, he spent a month at home.
The disgusting doctors made him a chest X-ray and led him to a chest catastrophe to remove the fluid they sent from his lungs to the analysis.
Yet, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition has slowly improved and returned to work.
His symptoms came back from time to time, often after he was practicing and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the O.R. and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But Abbott did not interact with his own case at that time.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and got into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition was again deteriorated and his doctor consulted his CT and X-rays with the expert panel.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started to feel bad, he was in the space between the probe of the chest cavity and the probe equipped with the camera.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency to take nothing too much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, she was worried.
The biopsy results came between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was a mesotheliom.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with his sisters from Macmillan's charity organization and one advised him to contact his lawyer.
At that point, he realized the range of epidemics.
"It turns out that asbestos has been abundantly used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
For people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now starting to show.
Therefore, the Mesotheliom is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous tubes of thermally isolated asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be at risk.
However, members of the staff who crossed the base hallways between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement meals (such as Graham Abbott often) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now appears, there were several decades after the war the hospital where they could have saved the patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is removed until today.
Teachers of Bunsen's Kahan built on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, librarys and councillors because of its excellent insulation and non-smoking property.
In school, too.
In fact, many asbestos were exposed at school.
Somewhere in countless class, the students built Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos base.
There were websites dealing with the question of asbestos in schools.
The harmless things such as floor tiles or shelter roofs on the tools in our homes typically contained asbestos.
"One of the industrial poison integrated into a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with the asbestos that a woman suffering from a mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s during the radiation of the garden cottage.
So watch out for the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is untreated, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been to the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I can't live another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from a doctor's position to a patient's position.
As a number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused about the number of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
“I asked my doctor: “How much time do I have left? ”
I was told that for 12 months.
I remember thinking: “Well, I can't live another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesotheliom is especially destructive, because the mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is a small fiber.
When the azbest breaks and the fibers breathe, they can settle in a burst, the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate and may cause cell mutation.
"The problems represent inhaled asbestos fibres in the form of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardiochirurg, who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital, where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during the hospital practice.
The needles of asbestos get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and “single breathing is pushing to the edge where the prosecutor is located.
It has been invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer do not take so much.
For example, there is a hot discussion about the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say she'd be worth trying.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the burst," he says.
You can't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer ‘not responding to chemotherapy’, which is ‘some effect’, but does not treat.
"Sometimes there will be someone who survives the lung cancer," says Treasure.
But eventually, everyone dies.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half months from his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding a mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and adviser for equally affected people.
When they called, he introduced himself: “Good day, you reached the center of cancer.”
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months, and probably only a month longer his life.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson “has shown things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdaski from the department of chest surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they checked me out," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a request, and they would have to approve of his pay.
For patients with mesothelioma, a question of money is crucial to access the best available treatment.
But when various treatments are finally inevitably failing, many patients face another financial concern - about the future of the family they leave here.
And that's why he turns into courts and wants compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even its very small amount could constitute a health risk.
And here we meet with the negligence of the company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally agreed, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could definitely not prove that the mesotheliom was a result of the asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the investigation of the case, spokesman Guy's Hospital confirmed that “azbest in the incriminated basement part was removed in the 1990s.”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove Asbestos
Usually spending a fatal asbestos exposure to one company or place of work - tens of years after this happened - for patients with mesothelioma trying to compensate has shown to be a huge problem.
A lot of former workplaces have changed or destroyed the owner.
The insurance evidence has disappeared.
And those who are now defending themselves have time on their side, which is definitely not their prosecutors.
In response to this fact, important new legislation has been approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to deal with compensation, even if it is not possible to supervise their former employer.
The law has created a 350 million financial reserve, which covers insurance companies and which is intended to be identified by people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In that case, the disabilities will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally acknowledge to them as a compensation - about 120,000 pounds.
Each year 300 successfully completed applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, as well as patients with mesothelioma, thinks 350 million pounds are "good work".
"It is an agreement written by insurance companies," says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they hadn't hit time and people with mesotheliom would be able to reach the former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “has had gaps.”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, quick negotiations were needed.
“Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the law relating to mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was under the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdanski 19 months.
Following initial consultations, Lang-Lazdanski recommended an operation that unlike Tom Treasura thought he had a positive effect.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed - a triple treatment with Lang-Lazdanski with a rate of survival of five years to 40% of patients.
Abbott's been getting stronger.
"It's not the most important thing, of course," says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition may get worse very quickly.

As for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After diagnosing, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly, we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more confusing.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face such interviews.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such talks are not relieved by hope or by a sign of survival.
Disease brings with him (and finally brought with Stephen Jay Gould) unhappy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “he does not jeopardize life.”

China refuses to give Hong Kong authority to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the multiplicating discussions on the democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step inspires long promising protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists started organizing and catching only a few hours after this notice.
The Chinese folk congress essentially allows the Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We were not surprised, but we were upset," said the legislature Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritative regime.
On the defense of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that the possibility of public nomination in Hong Kong's elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when the Chinese administration of Hong Kong has returned, Beijing promises that, starting in 2017, citizens will be able to vote in power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday decisions as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows direct votes, but also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders hold firmly the process of nominating the Committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months that recorded one of the largest and most observed protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democratical protests in Hong Kong are the Occupational Movement of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened by the closure of the financial quarter unless Beijing gives them general voting rights.
On Sunday night, only a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of favourors of the Occupation Movement gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement would enter a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks the waves of protests will begin.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their Internet statement, the organizers said that the movement “was considered the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in case all the options of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We must regret to announce that all the options of dialogue have been exhausted today and that the Centre's deployment is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the notification of Beijing for days and strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters on Sunday and deployed policemen and barricades.
The instigation of the distress is a sign of the fact that many people in Hong Kong are slowly losing control over the city.
The nature of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
They are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of words are a growing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupational movements of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten the business - the Hong Kong rescue boat.
"The protest he talks about could cause much more economic damage by how many people are involved and for how long," says Regina Ip policy that criticizes the movements for a long time.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perception could damage the investment.
The Chinese state media also came in the last few days with reports that the democratic activists in Hong Kong paint as substitution agents controlled by the west.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which came to 780 000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, dozens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.

The league in Jihlava wears the title by political movement
A small kick plays around 1,600 amateur athletes in the county town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is newly named together for Jihlava league.
The name was given by one movement that goes to October's Municipal Elections.
In addition, the tenth of his candidate is the boss of a little kicked in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"It was a general pile where there was no problem with it," said the cloud.
The situation around the first league, the little kickers already dealt with the lawyers of the South-Eastern City Hall and recommended to change the scheme of subsidy distribution.
The little dug was won last year by the city's website around a million crowns.
This year, it's about a hundred thousand.
According to the legal opinion, the process of small kicks is not contrary to the law or the rules of the Master.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to adjust the rules on grants and subsidies," said the spokesman of the Mayor of Radek Tulis.
I don't think it's going to be going to be going to work on a subsidy from the city at the same time as a little dumped support in the elections of one political party.
The high-social "big" football has not come up with a similar demand from politicians yet.
That the ČSSD branch, ODS division, or KDU-ČSL 1. could be created.
And the class and the same competition?
I wouldn't be there for that.
On the contrary, I would like to hear from our company sponsors," said the president of the Regional Football Union Miroslav Vrzáček.
Head of Little Football of another side and movement into the league name will not release
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, wardrobes and social facilities.
"For example, the playground in Stoupach is not ours, we are in rent there," said Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava Club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be, for example, the point of view, a pointless area for skates, which is about 50 in Jihlava," he warned Mr.
Prime Minister Jihlavy Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) reacted that a small dumped is using a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum utilisation.
We are going to modernize or build sports facilities in schools that will be accessible in the afternoons.
I think for a little dumped has made great progress in the last few years," he erased.
The other political parties in the names of the league do not appear according to Jan the Clouds.
We have limits.
If one of the departments enters our partnership, we do not put another in," he explained.
"Politic movement in the name of the league, I consider that at least a miserable step," said a member of the Board of Council for Sport Karel Voldan.
"But the voters will assess whether Mr Mr Mr. Marek uses the association Little kicked Jihlava and the city subsidy for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into the university's life - the prime ministers can fly a jet plane
We are pleased that we can answer the demand by starting the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options, including private jets or rolls-royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also declared that the service also has its security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to move their things across the entire state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that our VIF (very important fresher - very important elementary) variants this year to students arrive at the university with minimal nerve and maxim luxury.
The speaker said that since the services have only started, they have no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start to make reservations in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay an annual educational amount of £9,000, they expect the service to find their place on the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students are different about expectations and wishes - it's more important than ever making the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as inexperienced.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is inaccessible.
A lot of students who go to the university this month must be able to deal with a financial crisis before they throw thousands of pounds out for something as simple as getting to the railways, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the upcoming cost of basic needs.
Feministes are opposed to racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of a month, a policeman killed in Ferguson in Missouri an unarmed young man.
“Ruce up, do not shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, for shooting an unarmed young man Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in the online discussions of white women.
She found that when it comes to prosecution of reproductive rights and equality of income, she prefers white females of sex before the race.
With an increasing tension in the Central West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the white man’s reaction was 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of the black man soon after the shooting of August 9, personal articles with titles as “the idea of a white woman over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who would talk about races and privileges at such level," she said.
People felt that they had to express what happened.
For the crisis we face, it's characteristic because [situation in Ferguson] is so racially reserved that they had to alert it.
According to the professor of English at the state university in Ohio Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African Americans must face every day and which are not perceived as "woman's questions" in the cultural community.
"I can publish funny stories on Facebook from my life with my partner, and it gets 150 counts from people from all over the world," said Mitchell.
If I write something about the colorful being trapped in their own country, it's silent.
“How can a woman speak publicly about relations, but not about security in public space?” she asked.
For black girls like Mitchell, who dealt with the question of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no difference between race and gender dichotomy.
According to her, the blacks could not give luxus the following problems clearly to each other: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white girls today have a question of race and sex in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women's question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors have done otherwise.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost in all cases of white rape," said Hattery.
To justify lynching, you needed a white man's cooperation.
According to Hattery, the breakdown between white and black women came when the fighter for the right of the election Susan B. Anthony examined the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people can have a group of women or blacks.
“They decided to put the cards on the voting right for women and to the right for blacks to focus later,” explained Hattery.
If we realize this, we'll get an important preview of why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching in the Southern women’s association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the black people first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the response of white feminists to questions raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “enquire” the questions that the blacks concerned with generations.
“ Wouldn't it be great if activists on these premises [traditional feminism] would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they were taking the right to contraceptives?” Mitchell passed.
The second wave of feminists who have done careers by fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives now find out what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot at Facebook, where Rebecca Carroll from Guardian published a column that demanded white Americans to protest more racism.
"I hope that women who have different but yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and the opinions of the race that vary significantly in public opinion surveys - will strive for change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem is becoming an intersecional feminism, which involves race and gender issues, her comments on the race issue in America are confusing to some people.
Experts from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, the author of the book “Who stole feminism?” said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “a lot more vulnerable than their sisters”, but the notes of the Steinem sides of Ferguson are facing the critique that she had already raised before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House started a small program My Brother's Keeper, which was supposed to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reactions.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the mainstream interest of feminism.
After the American border police held this year in the southwest of the country almost 63,000 youthless without escorts, the issue of the reform of immigration laws was renewed - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-president We Belong Together, a woman mobilising the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to be able to present the question as necessary to women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercad.
Since most of the work permits are granted to men, women who will come with them will be in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories are voiced in women’s organizations,” she said.
Flathouse of pigs in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, rested on it in the living room of the pig.
One-room separate cottage, which is for sale for £ 120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The information photographs included the picture of the living room in which the head rests on the pig couch.
Connells Real Office said that a pig on the photograph is a pet owners.
"The flock came there by mistake, and that's why it was already removed," said the spokesperson of the office.
In real estate information Connells described the former prayer office as “the only single one-room cottage.”
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it is still appearing in promotional materials.
The sale of the house has created interest in social networks, where some have asked whether the pig is included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the town of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the southeast of Pertha, one lucky man from Saturday's lottery pulling home is going to take $1.1 million.
Harvey's hits had the second time in the five years, the winning of one million dollars was the last one in November 2009.
But a happy winner just has to log in.
The owner of Steve Forward's store said he's talking about winning the entire city in the southwest of Pertha.
It's the main subject, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was on the touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia last month split one win, making it a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and only a few weeks earlier, a few in Belmont won the incredible $7,5 million.
The winner's pair was about 20 years old, and she said that winning would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the only 59th lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
The GDL in the press statement marked the protest as a warning strike for which he had chosen time on purpose outside of the traffic tip.
At the chosen time, the strike takes GDL's attention to many people who come back from the weekend after the railroad during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people who arrive at work during the day," said the union on Monday morning in the press statement to declare the strike.
"Our first strike should intervene mainly in freight transport, less passengers," added GDL.
DB has not yet published an official response to the issue of the strike.
It is not even clear how protest actions affect international rail connections, including Czech Republic.
The departments require an increase in trainees' wages by five percent and a shortening of working time by two hours a week.
At the moment, the average salary of engineers is between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1,27 million) per year.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to increase salaries while shortening working time.
They stress that wage assessments of engineers must be developed as well as for other railway personnel in which DB does not count by shorting the working week.
It threatened that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why Barum rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was a defect of material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like this could happen.
Didn't the exhaust be repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service where the mechanics would switch it?
If we were going straight there, yes.
But there were two more erzetes waiting for us, and that didn't work.
There's a high temperature and the risk that the car starts to burn is big.
I can't afford that.
You've done five speed tests at a full rate.
What kind of impression did you feel of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, and I didn't go through the vint.
Everything was due to the fact that we had a car cranking for over six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You ripped him off so you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so we really had to win.
Work didn't come out.
On the other hand, the result we could've been thinking was not on.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technician said no.
You weren't the only one of the tips that prematurely resigned from the fight for primeness.
He also got out of the foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Surprised that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes.
Especially for the audience, it was a pity because the race ended early.
Even Jaromír Tarabus, who you're planning on, has been moving on a long time.
But he paid for flying out of the line and picking up almost a two-minute manoeuvre.
How were you happy with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degree of winners.
He's been driving the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well prepared.
He's gone very fast.
Exactly a year ago, you reported the end of your career, yet you showed up at the Barum rally start.
Is it good for you to make a regular participant of rally races again?
Not at this point.
Last year, I said Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't keep it.
I decided I'd drive her back.
It was my ninth start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'm going to do it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people have arrived on the track because of you.
Were you pleased?
To a certain extent, we were starting because of them.
A lot of people, acquainted or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's with you after Barumca?
The team continues.
Next week, we'll go to Vychova, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Honza Sýkor Fabio for this race.
Mira and I are waiting for a European dual race in Switzerland and Korsice.
That's what we're gonna have to do for next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When Korsická rallye belonged to the world championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the show.
Doesn't she want you to try that line again?
She doesn't.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not allow a doctor to testify on insufficiency, which serves as evidence for the organisation that you cannot do work for health reasons.
In addition, you did not notify the employer immediately.
Afterwards, there was an agreement that the days concerned will be recorded as holidays, but the agreement has only been made orally.
Although the law does not impose the obligation to confirm the consent of the employer to draw a vacation in writing, this procedure has been demonstrated in practice.
If only an oral agreement occurs, you do not have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the drawing of leaves, as in your case, denial and absence of work may be considered as a long-term unforgettable absence, therefore the reason for the immediate abolition of the employment ratio in accordance with § 53 Labour Law.
In the event of a court dispute, you do so lack proven evidence to speak to the employer.
However, the working relationship with you has not been abolished in accordance with § 53, only you have given the given days as an unforgivable absence.
The unforgettable absence in the calculation sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossible to collect material security in unemployment) but there is a difficult possibility to seek a new job.
We recommend you to visit the doctor again and to confirm in writing that there was a real injury that caused you to be incapable of your work (this is not the so-called "unschancer", it is only a doctor's document).
When searching for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of insufficiency, and the prompt notification to the employer or the request of written consent to the drawing of the leave.
You're avoiding any complications.
The accident of Tony Stewart on the line
The return on the track ended for Tony Stewart just a little bit behind the half of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went into the play twice after his 172th round broke his right front tire, and the race for him ended.
Stewart took the damaged car to the garage, didn't tell the reporters and leave.
Chad Johnston's chief of his team said that the car 14 team is disappointed, but he will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
“I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion,” Johnston said.
We're gonna go to Richmond and hope we're doing more.
Stewart ran into the play for the first time on a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which demanded a repair of his right side of his car.
“We put hope for a good end to today’s race,” Johnston said, “It just didn’t work out.”
Shortly after the crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to catch a place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident in which the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr died, who ran into Stewart during the race.
The authorities said that investigation of the cause of the accident will take at least two weeks.
It has not yet decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
A triple champion had a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started at 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked at 10th and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, went out of the second corner, and hit Stewart, and sent both cars to jail.
Stewart continued, but he went back to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi post manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed a selection procedure for the new cabin crew manager.
For 103 parking stations, he gets about 12.3 million crowns a year.
The taxi drivers selected 150,000 crowns every year for the same places.
He informed Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Earlier, the city used a drawer to select administrators.
The winner then gained rent for a flat amount of 1,000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
It is currently deciding the amount of the offer.
"A year from the termination of the original lease contracts and the opening of the selection proceedings proved that the new lease system was far more advantageous and more fairly," says the councilman.
The most expensive spot is on the Persket
The highest price was offered by candidates for a station in the street in Persket.
They pay $2,1 million annually.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by new administrators for places in front of the General House or the Václav Square.
The new rules for renting tax offices adopted in autumn 2012 and the original lease contracts last summer.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and a new administrator found 29 posts.
We had to clean the well the second time this year.
We released her all the time, creating a virtually second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo there.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the basement has always sparked enough beautiful smelly waters.
And that wasn't any kind of professionally done, grandfather smothered her with his help.
A long time ago.
She was just on three scouts and vice versa, like everything else on the cottage, but as I say.
Water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But then we dreamed the water wasn't smelling.
We were wondering if something went down.
In the place where the pump was going, it was possible in a bit of bad luck, there the board wasn't much of a lie, so the hole was sealed with a brick piece.
Our inspection confirmed the brick move.
Otherwise, there was nothing in the water, and we flashed it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we improved improvised sealing around the pipe pump.
In the basement, we noticed strange things.
There was a sticky package on the ground with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a blinded mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where the passages, the grandfather's invention, were the residues of the fish!
And hardly done!
Our basement's self-recognizable, too.
Someone would say grandfather was just underhrabing the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
Walls and floors are just suffocated sand, but the ceiling is submerged.
The boats are headed there.
And wheels.
And the beach lounge.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open as someone went there all the time.
At the ceiling, several of the already mentioned airways.
Without the network, so birds usually fly there, and they build nests on the weeds.
It's useless to mention the mouse.
Grandpa wanted it to luft, and that's what he wanted.
But now, of course, the luft didn't help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We dumped things around: boards, heraclit boards and stuff.
Our long-distance cabin was welcomed by a passing disinfectant.
We were thinking, who could have drawn those disgusting residues?
The closest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It's hard for her to come to the house to swing.
Grandfather attacked one neighbor who's not all right.
If he didn't get us those disgusting things out there?
He's practically been here all year long, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to watch the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, only for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water from the forest pool is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
Once we heard the horrific anxiety of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Réza jumped over her and washing her like a fool.
Mom used to explode her because she thought Réza was cutting a sink hose out of her sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partly stirred into the club and partly emptied.
There's a sying on the balcony.
Réza got a hysterical seizure.
We ran downstairs.
A long, long over a meter and fat as a bull, she was about to swallow a huge oil and Réza was defending her.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save her toad or if she wanted to eat her alone, but that was irrelevant.
When the old man saw the crossings in the form of our whole family, she probably asked us to eat it when we were so hungry, and elegantly stretched into the basement.
We were flying to see her.
Like the lightning, she jumped to the well.
By the way, we recorded another smelling package on her board.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new safety around the pump was a bit of a jerk.
And we closed the basement over the day.
That he would...
We went out and we're all stuck in the same air.
We didn't wait long.
It fucked up for the well.
First, there was a flat head with yellow moons on the neck.
And then it went all the way to the well.
She got around the pump and started getting inside.
A fired employee revenge, purchased laptops on the company and sold them
A sinful employee after release bought a computer company and then sold them.
The money gained was to spend before the police were arrested.
Within a short time, a man bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in 12 cases.
"Notebooks after taking them to Olomouce, where he sold them after the databases," said the Chief Commissioner of the Champagne Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of fraud was the revenge of the employer for release, as well as the profit of money.
"In the interrogation, he said that he used the money to pay off loans," said Brückner.
The police also found out that a fraud is a pathological player who repeatedly treated for psychiatry.
The money could have also ended up in winning instruments or videoloterial terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," said the Commissioner.
The underwater who has already been punished for theft is now in prison for one year to five years.
The police have not yet communicated whether the punishment also threatens to the databases that the laptops have bought and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the database owners have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared some changes to us.
It was the biggest change of the route that led the target to the patch instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally heal our readers at the stand where we were taking pictures together and filming videos.
To get my look on the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
With my friend Katya, we were obedient to the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes.
Friends who walked around for faster runners.
There's not much time left.
A couple of hot-heads, a couple of sportstesters, a countdown and a start!
The screams of jasoth, but instead of a fast start, followed the cupitation to the starting line.
After five minutes, we're coming to the gate, taking measurements and running at the rate of ten.
We're going through the yellow snake of runners, who, like Katya, runs their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, slowly dropping the sun on the sky delivers the view of Vyšehrad almost up to a cheeky breath.
The pulsive mass of the coast looks like the whole Prague is running here.
On the coast between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre traditionally begins to show who has the strength.
Light kicks on the Palacký square make many runners slow down or walk.
I see a police escort just before the Theatre crossing, and right behind him, the Welcome Pavlišt is flying incredibly incredibly incredibly towards the goal.
I hear the adorable fussing of other runners.
I move to the edge of the line, I encourage him, he's going to squeeze with me, but right before that, he's gonna squeeze my leg, and our hands just mine.
The theatre street run gives a chance to relax and breathe.
There are places in front of us to get my breath out of view.
The turn on the Most of Manes shows Prague in the entire beauty of the sun.
I don't breathe, and my legs almost bring me alone.
There's a moment of truth for the first refresher.
During the crossing of the road, Katya is going to scrub about the curb and show the jump of the cruise.
I see if she needs help, and I start a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
He rises up and continues with the Goat alley, it is one of the easiest places of the line, although at this stage of the race there is no such arson, but it is necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I don't know yet that the concept of the easiest place will gain its true significance later.
We are frenetically encouraged by tourists and by friends of other runners.
I'm trying to claw with anyone who's offering my hand, and I'm advised too, because ten applause with the fans is like half the energy bar.
It really works, we're speeding up again, and if we've fallen pretty much, now we've started a prosecution ride.
We're ahead of dozens of runners, having someone particularly tired, trying to encourage him a few words, "Come on, take a little bit more, you can do it!"
No one runs at the last refresher, we're speeding up.
So far, we're running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but you really need to swing.
The sun has slowly fallen and the ending day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last run on the bridge, the turn, and just a plane to the target.
The darkness that we're running is surprising to me. Where is this girl coming from?
"Come on, let's go under 13, we work!" I'm calling.
We're trying, sprinting, and there's a target.
The hour of 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach gave a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Closely for the goal of the Kata's legs, I help her to the railroad where she's resting for a while.
It is seen exhaustion, but also the happiness of the well done performance.
After a while, I'm taking her out of the target space.
Euforia doesn't make us think of a button in the doorways to the wardrobe.
Here you can see that the Goat alley wasn't the easiest place.
That's what's up to the target of a patch that's almost 10,000 runners pushed to crack.
If anyone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for him.
I'm losing my head for a while, and I'm wondering if these beautiful views and more interesting routes were worth what's going on in the target.
From my own experience, I know there's no fun in organizing a race.
If ten thousand people join, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route has shown to runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere reconstituted in Yellow Baths was moved between the runners and the race itself.
Organisers around the track and random audiences graduated it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, the city's historical centre must count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but the target of the mass race in a place that is bordered on the one side by the wall and the other river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I think that the race ended up running through the target, I value him as a very successful one.
To aim, I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but everything ended up well.
Write to us a discussion, if you liked the route, and what you're saying about the situation at the destination.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison service employees throughout Bulgaria participated in a national protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
At peaceful demonstrations, they reiterated their demand for reintroduction of the original working conditions that have changed recently.
On the list of requirements to be discussed with the Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov, there are also higher salaries.
The guards of the month symbolically protested against new working times and demanded a return to the original twenty-hour shifts.
Although the unions of prison overseers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian state radio (BNR).
"There are still ongoing," said BNR, Head of the Directorate-General of the Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Union trade unions at the Ministry of Interior will also be joined in the prison service protests.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them?
Physicians usually don't pimp bests, but in 1999 Brian Green from Columbia University managed to hit black.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laiques to penetrate the poush problems that today deals with a number of theoretical physicists - trying to unite two well-functioning but uncompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that, in the case of finding a united physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The physics basic problem between two key theories (even at this point our universe de facto is divided into two worlds with different laws) solved and resolves the idea that it is worth reversement to the laiquets.
In addition, Greene has consulted with the complex material so fresh and cuffy that he can't be counted on how much interesting he has not included in his book.
In addition, his "deficiency" in large part corrected in the other two books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Realty.
Apparently, neither the author would object if his book had taken care faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe has still provided almost all the important things that the informed polio with ambition should understand the world about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is rather likely that in the next years it will only be more live in this area (the need for the accelerator LHC to finally go to the "full gas" and so it is a good time to enter the Greene inevitably open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, weird or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
In order to understand this, let us turn our vision away from the universe for a moment as a whole to something more grounded, specifically for a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you draw a 100-metre garden hose from one side of canyon to the other, and the whole scenery you follow from a half-km distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From this distance, you can easily record a long horizontal direction of the stretched hose, but if you don't have the brightness right now, the thickness of the hose will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given your great distance from the hose, you would think that the cloud forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can go through: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the cloud was at the moment, you will answer him with only one information: the distance of the ants from the left (or the right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from the mid-km distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we will suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the cloud can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimensional direction of the hourly hand movement", i.e. around the circular diameter of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of the small morgue you must enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a rolling hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is double-dimensional (a.k.a. Experts will notice that this chapter concentrates purely on the dysfunctional string theory.
The impaired aspects are discussed by chapters 12 and 13).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long long long long long long long dimension is illustrated with a direct arrow, dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, is short and swine.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the glowing hose circuit is short, "swine" and worse marked.
To realise the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
The example mentioned illustrates the important characteristics of the spatial dimension.
That they're splitting into two groups.
They can be either large, vast, and therefore directly visible, or vice versa, small, swine, and much worse observable.
Of course, in that case, we didn't just dissolve ourselves so that the "svinute" dimension of the folding thickness of the hose was revealed.
It's enough to take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only reveal a swine dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he had told with a tremendous idea that space geometry could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
His radical claims Kaluza justified that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relationship and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be introduced into a single united conceptual structure.
The question is immediately inclined as to how this Calulus observation goes along with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza foreseen quietly between the lines and clearly expressed and specified the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and glazed dimensions.
This means that as well as the dimension in the direction of the hose length, our universe also has a large, varied and lightly visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize at any moment.
But in analogy with the circular circuit, the garden hose can also have additional dimensions, firmly swine into space so tiny that they have been hidden before our most perfect experimental cameras.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Calulus' remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine that on the hose circuit, we will draw a relatively black colour of a large number of circles.
Looks like the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With a telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we will reveal a swine dimension even easier, because we will see the motive from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is double-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the second short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circular dimension has three large spatial dimensions, together four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw the object with too many dimensions.
In order to help our imagination, let us notice the illustrations on Figure 3; it shows two great dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space, just like we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge enlargement of space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe can have an additional dimension (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they're swines in sufficiently small space, thus explaining that we haven't seen them directly yet.
The Quarter network presents a commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle of a new, tiny and swine dimension.
Just as strings of threads in a thickly welded carpet, even these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - only because of the illustration we put them in the cross-sections in the square network.
The background of Figure 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such normal scales as the meters, marked side of the small square in the square network.
On each of the following images, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at several first levels of enlargement.
However, if we follow the microscopic characteristics of the space geometry further - to the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 -, we will suddenly see a new, into the shape of a swine dimension, a similar loop of thread in a thick woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimension, just like the hose of the circular circuit at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we only covered the circular dimension in some of the regularly placed points.
Figure 4 of Kaluzova and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry summarizes.
Similarity to the hose is obvious, although we record important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (from which we drew only two), while the hose has only one large size.
Even more importantly, the difference is that we are talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
The basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular swine dimension is extremely miniature, to recognize it - as well as the circular hose circuit - much harder than to observe apparent, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed above the strength of our most modern tools to enlarge.
The most important thing, however, is that the additional dimension is not just an obliteral plunger inside the normal dimensions, as a two-dimensional illustration misleads.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent, just as are the dimensions of the mountain-doles, left-right and from the front-back independent (and perpendicular) each other.
Sufficiently small ants could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine its position, except three normal positions in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case by one more than we normally expect.
Are you impressed?
You can buy the book of the Elegant Universe of Brian Greeen here for books.idnes.cz.
The price for e-book is CZK 149.
To our surprise, we find that if we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzovo and Klein’s thoughts show that this does not exclude the existence of additional swine dimensions if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see in the eyes.
How small should they be?
The latest technical equipment can recognize the structure of a large billion-dollar meter.
Smaller swine dimension, we can barely see.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz's idea with several ideas from just born quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicate that the additional circular dimension could have a size of about one Planck length, that is, size far beyond the distinctive capacity of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have been calling the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kaluza-Klein theory.
Swing Honza Homola advises how to practice on electric guitar: 5th part
The whole essence of "twelve" lies in a 12-tact harmonic form that you can repeat at any time.
Whoever is in musical theory will find its principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
Educational meadow and meadow conductor whose facebook profile can be monitored here, from graduation 20 years ago live as a graphic.
He's a guitarist of Wohnout's band, which, unfortunately, cannot be left.
The guitarist is after his father, just like Brother Matthew, leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one string.
"Rythmic model is only for you, you can think of anything, then apply it to a harmonic model of twelve," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you need to do is listen to and watch Honza, what you can think about with the 12-track harmonic on two strings, and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you add a third string, you can come up with some songs with melody.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for a change of tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatony and try to get her together with the 12th.
So practise her honestly.
As best, you can read it in a conversation with Jane Homola at his first lesson in his school play on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big slave, acknowledges the Castle Dvořák
We take the point and we love it.
The first half time we had more chances, the second home," said the attacker, who scored this time from a fine kick.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but he was accompanied by a huge cunt?
Somehow I didn't see it, even though the other gate, where home fans are, it'd probably be worse.
You balanced the penalt after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept in the beginning, we were passive, it came from the corner and then the penalt after him.
After her, you were up, and the first half time you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree we've played well after the incredibated goal until the break.
In the cabin we thought we wanted to keep the game pace, but we couldn't do it.
To be honest, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that they said something to their game about the rest of the house, probably not very happy with her.
You've only scored the rival field for the first time, while at home you've not even got a goal.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's such a difference, rather it's up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad of us, Plzen, that's another category.
You waited for four goals, didn't you worry that it might be similar after the last game?
I don't think so, but obviously we're glad we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal to listen since the last game.
Now we've added more without waiting, but they're still only three in six matches, which is still not a big slave.
Iceland - a lion flows from a mile of distant crater.
The lava flying to the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the Vatnajökull iceberg, flows through the underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It is located under the iceberg, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact is now most concerned by scientists...
The situation remains inevitable for now.
Since last morning (31.8.
2014) It continues to fly out of the cliff about the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Contrary to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists fear that a lava tunnel could be opened even in places under the ice.
If this happened, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökulsa a Fjöllum, and on the other rivers.
There's a strong smell of sulphur in the area of the eruption, rising the cloud of steam and gases.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourist traffic, as it was in the case of an eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are much more gases," says vulcannolog Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has been significantly improved since yesterday, in the morning, it has almost been in the area of windlessness.
The footprints of the sand storm were wasted with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic the orange degree (second highest) for Bárðarbungu and yellow (third) for Askju.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked through the wings
Aeroplane day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, Peggy Valentine's air acrobatic acrobat appeared from the cockpit to the castle on the upper wing of the two flasks and also between the wings.
There is only reference to the strength of muscles.
The day in Cheb took place this year was the fifth and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting air pieces again.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "going after wings" in the submission of the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary p-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft aircraft 18.
He put the attention on himself with his bright coating.
An acrobacy called Wingwalking is originally in the USA.
After World War I, this was how many former war pilots were struggling.
But because of a large number of fatal traumas, it was forbidden.
But today he slowly returns to the flight days program.
Peggy will come out of the cockpit on the top wing after the launch.
That's where he performs different exercises.
At the end of the performance, it will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," said Ludzinek Matějiček from the Chebský Ultralight Club and the air day organizer.
The pilot of the plane Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If the performance of Peggy was the main comb of the program, then the following performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary prosecutor came to the area with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the corner (so-called numbers).
This was the first time the airline fans in the Czech Republic could've seen this set.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated all the breaths of the acrobacy with the aircraft from 1945.
He was made during the war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963 he worked in a civilian community.
Even like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Castle.
In the same place there is also another pearl of the Chebian air day, a two-motor Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the mighty machine didn't go overlooking.
His polished aluminum coupling radiated into a distance.
Admired also the machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French air force.
The small transport plane surprised for a renounced Turbolet and from German Hofu brought part of the German delegation for the flight day.
German neighbors in Cheb demonstrated with reconstructed planes Like 18T or three-member forming Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
My parents' concerns exchanged Lucie Borhy for at least tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness, a blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of this.
She's been doing well with Moderated TV messages, as if she didn't stop for two months at all!
It's only been two weeks since the blondes ended six Sunday, where women experience the greatest stress after birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news session of TV Nova.
Regulatory return is waiting for it according to Lightning.cz information for a month.
After all, Linda's daughter needs her now more than television audiences.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen, and it was a black shot.
Exhibition for a year in Prague?
Hala would sell out, she's planning a bachelor party.
It would be dignity if something like this had happened during the world championship.
But it depends on how the union will stand on it," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Fight, in which a remarkable Nagan team was reunited.
Even the players who participated in the gold hattice.
Players would like that, wouldn't they?
Definitely.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think it's possible to find one two days during the tournament, when it's full time off, and where such a game could be placed.
We'll tell Gum (Jirim Šlegr) or Beď Ščerban (the organizer of the South-East match) to take care of...
The Arena would have sold out.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So if I fly in...
You don't want to play the representation.
Or did the jihlavian meeting somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition are two different things and there are decisive performances in the representation.
One thing is, people would like to see me there, but performances are decisive, especially in the world championship.
That's where players should ride it, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagan Assembly?
It's just that meeting the players was great.
You've had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience, not just for fans, but for us hockey.
However, the most important was the honour of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey and that there's one generation leaving that's really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Bohemian on the shift.
Do you still remember your first representation game yourself?
You don't forget such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we entered one-third.
It was the first representation start for all of us.
Well, we'd dominate in some way, I can't say that.
In Jihlava, after a long time, Dominik Hašek caught.
What did you say about his performance?
I'll never be surprised by the Hashman on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the representation).
Even the Nest has done a great show.
You were trained with me one night and there was a hole.
And now he's caught fabulously.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, soccer players start qualifications
A prominent guest was arriving at the NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could have seen Peter Bohemian goalkeeper from Chelsea, representative coach Pavl Vrbu...
And there, the character in the black cap, that's Tomáš Rosický!
Arsenal's backup and the Captain of Representation arrived at the reunion of about half twelve between the last.
We have a beautiful fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he'd already stepped up in the representation set before the journalist.

The representation opened a Tuesday training for them, starting at the Summer at 6:30 p.m.
And after it will be followed by the autography, which will not be missed by the Russian or the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be more peaceful.
Which commends coach Vrba, who just complained about the amount of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so much time so far," he commended Vrba, who has officially led by the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The representation has three matches behind the Vrbou, all the preparations.
With Norsko and Finland, she remitted 2:2, and with Austria she lost 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's not until now.
The Netherlands’ fight will start its qualifications for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, the Czech manhood would have helped if the general had taken over the United States.
The first half of it was for us to meet.
Now the results are important.
We need to think of success," Vrb said.
The only player of the thirteen-member nomination that has health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's having a fever.
If he hadn't recovered from the U.S. medic fight, Coach Vrba would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she'd die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescents in the presumption that she had only a few years of her life.
In fact, it was a Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK charitable organization said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that around 23,000 people suffer from CMT in the United Kingdom, which may show symptoms in the field of motors such as muscle weakness, immotive walking and twisted fingers on their feet.
Inflammation or pain may also occur in the affected, this condition is unhealable and progressive, which means that symptoms are deteriorated in the course of time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from a Freidreich Ataxy (FA) - a disease that has a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she was celebrating her 18th birthday, she would be stuck on a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children now 51 says: “I knew as a child that I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer.
I've never been able to ride wheelchairs or skateboards with other kids, and they bullyed me at school because I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was thirteen and was after several operations that were supposed to release her Achillov's footsteps and straighten her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room, and looked into her documentation where she knew she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, and I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I totally panicked.
I thought before I was eighteen, I'd end up in a cart, and before I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my skills.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk wasn't worse than she expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said: “Honey, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair.
I think it's going to be a much less dangerous life."
After graduating several genetic tests, he found out he had CMT.
"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky kid," she said.
CMT UK has launched a month of information on CMT to draw attention to this disease.
Businesses in Washington: taxes on the turnover of the economy
Growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of companies in the country with accelerating the recovery of the economy slightly increased last year and the companies in Washington were not exceptions.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia, together for fiscal year 2013, brought $27.6 billion to national and local treasures, which is 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burden - state and local - last year increased by 4.3% to $671 billion compared to $3.9% last year and was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010 when taxes were reduced.
According to the study carried out by Ernst & Young and the political grouping of Center on State Taxation, the state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than the local deductions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenues of the precinct, 56%, is from trade tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28%, presents proportionally the smallest tax revenue from the business.
Researchers claim that the majority of tax revenue growth is due to an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which, this year, after three consecutive years, increased by -1 % growth by 3.7 %.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation appears to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginii paid over ten billion dollars last year on state and local property taxes, which compared to 9.6 billion in 2012 represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not push so much up to state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where the tax on real estate represents less than five years of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax is almost half of the state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, he owns a lot of property to companies, especially the basis of taxes in the area of D.C., the government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to relieve much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenue cannot only be attributed to the healing of the real estate market.
According to the data, revenues from the business seem to be increasing as well.
Companies in this region have published a tax on corporate income of 2.3 billion dollars, which have increased from 2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland chose one billion dollars on business revenue taxes, most in the region.
Although they are settled in the same direction, the local tax burden of entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average, at 4.3% while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was an increase in taxation below average, to 4.5%.
Virginia has of all three circuits (of which all have the same taxation) the lowest taxation of the revenues of business companies, 6 %.
The taxation rate of the companies in Maryland is 8.25% while the average of D.C. remains relatively high to 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has a lower state and local taxation and overall more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of the South competition.
North Carolina has recently signed a tax reduction of 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax will be reduced to 5% next year.
If it continues to meet the income targets in the coming year, the tax rate laid down in the Act may be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to the recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, and therefore higher national and local taxes are paid.
Živnosten tax levied by small entrepreneurs as a tax on personal revenues - the compensation structure for raising costs by increasing prices, according to which most companies are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% to $2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and national increase in trade tax will probably continue next year, the total tax revenue from sales to governments and local governments will increase to 6.2% over the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may remain behind others, as the reduction in state expenditure takes its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafatov's scissors
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the Southeast of Ukraine, where government forces have been facing Prorusian rebels since April.
He also warned the European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, would be difficult to return to the Russian market.
The support provided by the West to war on the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contradicted by democratic values.
The end of the conflict according to him depends on Kiev, and he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Another sanction for Russia?
The Czech Republic has required the right to disagree with the parts
The European Commission, together with diplomats, proposes the form of further acknowledgement of the anti-rusian sanctions, decided at the EU Summit tonight.
The regular chairman of the Herman Van Rompuy's Member States told the journalists.
According to the Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to move the form of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new President of the Union.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union Summit for the President of the European Council, i.e. the so-called President of the Union, who runs the summits of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuy will be replaced.
In the head of the European diplomacy, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs of Federica Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton.
The Italian, which will become the vice-president of the future European Commission, still has to confirm the European Parliament in its office.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, just don't talk about it.
Helping an unhealable and long-term patient with a retirement from life?
In the Czech conditions where laws do not authorise euthanasia, that is legally impossible.
Yet, from the opinion of the LN doctors, they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately three hundred people, 21 patients are undergoing experimental treatment in Prague Motole with stem cells.
We definitely don't know if it's going to be successful.
But if we don't try it, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, motolic neurologist.
It's about knowing the CIA manuscript, they needed a war, Huml writes about the shooting of the MH17 flight.
The messenger for the ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear in who shot the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "the hard sanctions that have been declared in view of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead have caused intentionally the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, it makes it possible to know the CIA's handwriting.
Incomplete promises.
The elections are approaching and the parties offer the impossible again
The end of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and cable over Prague.
This is repeated before each choice: the parties promise impossible.
Also, now, with closer municipal choices, politicians prevail who are more pleased with voters.
The Lidovky Server.cz has chosen incomprehensible promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovakia landed at Dunkerque.
It's getting dressed up.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška constantly requested to supplement the technical equipment and send to the front.
Finally, the British Party met and ranked this ground unit as one of its forces in circumventing the Dunkerque port city, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads league before Prague "S", Liberec declassified Baník
Viktoria Plzen is the new leader of the football league that leads about a point before both Prague "S".
Changes in the head of the table caused the defeat of Slavie 1:2 in Mladé Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, thanks to two Lafat interventions, she defeated Jablonec.
The record win in the year was signed by Liberec, who shot the Ostrava 6:0 Baník.

Poles say yes
Home MS volleyballs in Warsaw brought a viewer's record.
At the football stadium under the roof, 62,000 spectators watched a smooth home prize over Serbia.

How to survive the return from holidays?
Don't rush and enjoy your sleep.
The last days of holiday are ahead of us.
Using after returning from the sunny beach or cottage to normal working pace can be for many nuts.
He may even be associated with depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to cope with the changed situation: do not rush and make a good sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "We hold our thumbs"
Joan Rivers is unconscious three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but today her daughter expressed her hope that an eleven-year-old chimney would recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call for a rescue service, according to which there was a cardiac stop on the Upper East Side endoscopy, as the source said.
The doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition that remains “great”.
The reaction to each other has not long waited, including incredibly online support from personality like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Realty is twisted subtitles
That the media twisted their headlines of reality, there is no news.
I know that the titles "sold" of the newspaper, but unfortunately, I also know that many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's the fact that I've been very concerned lately, more powerful than the word's pissed off.
This concerns in particular the articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
They're all common, "Israel attacked Gaza."
You can only read in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the burned missiles from Gaza, often during the time of the declared truce.
That then appears the title "The parties have broken the truce."
Does the journalistic community realize that this procedure is directly involved in anti-Semitian positions that grow across Europe (and not only there)?
Not even 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, people who survived Shoo are alive.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd screamed out the password of "Jewish swine" and similar disbelief, I got trapped.
Does the world want to finish what didn't succeed Hitler?
Do our journalists realise that after the Jews they were destined to dispose of the Slovans?
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a little more attention to your work.
You're often referred to as "watching dogs of democracy."
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the law of the single truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decides to destroy the Czech nation and to remove the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Maybe you should realise one more fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, almost 20% of the Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them, why don't they go between "they" or Gaza, they'll answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top health care (I've seen it in my own eyes, as the top private hospital of Hadassa, which is financed by the sponsorship gifts of Jews from all over the world, usually the Arabs go and are treated there, of course).
Hamas attacks his Arab brothers, too.
The only real help of Gaza, and this restless area, is to get rid of Hamas and disarm him.
And not judge Israel, indirectly in the subtitles.
Inform Hamas's practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is intended to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even for the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform them that Hamás is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform them that in nine years, governments in Gaza could have been the area that was revolving through humanitarian assistance from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which delivers water and electricity, which, of course, Gaza’s managers do not pay for, and they even get angry that at this time the supply of the current is interrupted.
If Hamás hadn't invested money into the construction of underground tunnels, so that they could penetrate suicide attackers in Israel, but, for example, the construction of housing houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would be much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the statement Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys $1.04 billion (970 million US dollars) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement triggered a surprise not because no one would expect Twitch someone to buy, but because it was expected that you would be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Googlu seemed certain for one billion, and this connection looked natural.
Twitch, who started Justin.tv only three years ago, had been designed to become a universally used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transmissions from games - the words Business Insider “YouTube for lively transmitted plays”.
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos "Let's play", a species where mudrlanti (most older) give the game processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to a lot of shock when describing Twitche, so the news that YouTube buys Twitch, no one too much disrupted, was a textbook example of how the established company pays possible competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't go, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: “We took Amazon because they believe in our company, it has the same value and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster.”
Another mystery is, honestly, Twitch's incredible success.
For snobs like me, who claim to do sport rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, playing instead of real playing just to watch.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder at 3:00 in the morning, like Resident Evil plays, and a completely different thing is to watch someone stranger get 20 hits in his head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, the most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so look at their record without you able to control the perspective yourself, is quite a good recipe for how to get your pains.
I admit that the speed run games, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone isn't a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably won't be very interesting.
But what do you know about the sceptic like me?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of the Internet.
How exactly will Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine Twitch mixing into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
Twitch has something to attract every company: the hordes of young men that the advertisers want.
As director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, “the future of the games” and the media do not look like she would be wandering, even like - a swallowing - viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the topic "The Holy Scriptures are the word of God."
Attached original video.
The second basic lies of creationism are faith that sacred texts have been written by god and not by human authors.
When the believers debate one of many things that contradict their religion, they often raise us to the question: Who will you trust?
A true word of God, or a word of man?
As if human investigations were completely ruthless in comparison to the authority they consider to have their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to the myths of God written by people.
If there is really intelligent with a creator with some purpose, then he is the one who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be the one who invented the genetic formulas that match her, and it must be the one who added another series of evidence that show exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion into the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And they were the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "inspired" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or maybe listened to the dictate of angels, but these texts were not written by anyone other than just mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and no more gods.
If there was a true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the all-compassionate entity.
If the being of such size ever wrote a book, there would be only one book like that, a single scripture.
She would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallel or alternatives in any language, because human authors could not measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have blindly believed it, because it would be consistent, based on verified and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom beyond all human limits.
It would sustainably inspire every reader to unite the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't expect anything smaller.
But what we see instead is the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all are constantly falling apart on more separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each in some way entitles God’s guidance, regardless of continuing diversion and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Bahá'u'llah's Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathuštrova Avesty, the Sighian Adí-Granth, the Mahabharatská Bhagavad-Gita, the book Mormon, or the book Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true god" and the relative believers of each of them say that those others are on the way.
The only logical explanation is that all of us are at a certain rate in the way of misleading.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage compared to others.
None of them have evidence resistance, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (protections), because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive imaginations once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it can't be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them are prosecuting disbelief instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to be confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - with that each may also contain prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and therefore are subject to interpretation, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudication of politically motivated authors, explaining many of the anti-contractions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it contradicts, more like mutual comments.
We need to reiterate that we have two different authors, whose work has been somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's definitely not the story of a eyewitness!
Some experts are now distinguishing four different sources only for the Pentatheus, i.e. the five book "Moses" and not assigning any authorship to Moses, because he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as the believers think.
The scrolls from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all the Western monotheistic faiths, and yet many centuries younger than the roots of zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Helénis, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic belief, followed the doces and the ebionics and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodoxia.
Other Christian groups such as lucipherians were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these adjustments refers to the king of Ugarit who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to the young mosquito religion, the authors of the New Law decided to ridddle and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount" changed to Belzebub "Pana much".
So the Bible was deliberately and underlyingly altered both for religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament was canonised in the 4th century C.E. in the series of Commission decisions in the House in Nicay.
Four Gospels were accepted and 16 others were rejected by simple hand lifting, as if the reality of some things could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the cannon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in those Christian centres.
What was read on Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman church at the same time?
And they gradually learned that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
And so the core of the cannon was evolved from the dawn of the church.
So the end simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that were going between uneducated masses at that time.
But they took more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referring to the books that were approved.
We will find the apostles and Prophets, between the rejection items.
Why should God’s word refer to books that are only words of people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved if God were the true author of this coincidence of reputation, parables and psalmous lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans and certainly not by enlightenment, rather on the contrary!
That's why it's so much of its content historically and scientifically completely mistaken, whether it's almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in enclosures, blood offerings, ritual magic, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and five nutrients of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to kill someone with blood, it'd cure him from a leper.
We're talking about people who thought the rabbits were rumors and bats are birds and whales are fish and drinks that are the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed a pregnant cow stripped patterns, they would give birth to stripped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible had written some higher beings, then it would not contain the errors it contains.
If the pen came from a truly superior being and was intended as literal history, then it would not contain any of the things it contains.
As a moral guide completely fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings have been written by uneducated and big-time savages who have overlooked or promoted cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, lament, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice to race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by saying that they do God's will.
But the creativityists are still ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, it must be ignored!
Why?
Because if the creationists hadn't had their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world there is one thing, and the other is the same.
It's ironic that they reject God's "share" as "the worship of creation instead of the Creator".
But they consider the word of man as the word of God and the god themselves, and even insist that the resurrection of their allegedly "sacred" books somehow throws out God as such.
Not their version of God but all versions of God.
Creacionist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate the doctrine from the gods.
So it's a type of idolatry where believers worship man's compilations, as if these books were God's, because they think they are His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their allegedly "needful word" of any god has been designed, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered and circumcised by just misguided people.

He has feelings for typography and clean elegant design, which is the way we want to take ourselves further in the vision of news news," says the Creative Director of Novy Alan Zaruba.
Apple iCloud allegedly undergone to hackers, the public got naked images of celebrity
Screenshot with escaped files
So far an anonymous user on the server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, pointed out the American server Mashable.com.
It is allegedly obtained an unauthorised access to the Appla user accounts, where the disabled have recorded it by means of automatic backup of images from iPhons and iPads.
Apple hasn't expressed a problem yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as counterfeited, but has already granted several of the pictures concerned.
They include actor Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss, in the Hunger Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Smrtonos trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
The shots allegedly showed the interest of the American magazines, according to the 4chan server reports, but he wants a hacker rather money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is probably very likely a weakness in the security of iCloud.
On GitHub's server, a tool appeared two days ago, which allowed to get passwords to user accounts through gross power, i.e. automated repetition of login attempts with different passwords.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is true that potential attackers have had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts prior to the publication of this instrument.
ICloud users should therefore, for preventive reasons, change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The escape of naked images of the celebrity as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although they are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, secured multiple times better than households or smaller companies, it is to upload sensitive photos in unprotected form of unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up the explicit photos online or any other sensitive content, first encrypt the files before upload.
It is also understandable to set automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it only takes place on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will have the opportunity to move "to safety" in time, and most importantly you will have the space to remove unreported images, so they will not unnecessarily take the space in the online storage site.
The instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet are offered to HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book from Michal Altair Valášk in PDF format.
A smart way to save for a college script
Since the price for the college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the second year student has come with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from colleges from higher-year-olds with the offer of nominal compensation to stop them from selling them back.
"The book for calculations that normally cost $ 180, I've won for a semester for ten and for chicken nugets," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year for textbooks and tools, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is to become online shops and creative solutions like Schroeder's.
There are textbook loans on the rise, which allows students to use a semester book often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 booksellers in campus premises, says that the loan of books has been doubled since 2011.
Research in the branch shows that around a quarter of books in university books were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased by the National Association of University Shops in university bookstores.
Here's the 101 best way to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices of some new books can be less on the Internet than one third than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost 290 dollars, but on the internet it is possible on Chegg.com, in a retail shop specialized in textbooks, to buy a new for $39.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the comments of other people or wear and degradation, the appropriate options are used in teaching texts.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a higher-year student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid 42 cents for the used copy "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The new was sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students in their teachers check whether the older issue is acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work in seminars are not significant.
If so, older releases may be sold for a fraction of the last version price.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a favorite alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
It is also worth considering lending textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them, and you do not need them to have them after the seminar has ended.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for the new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about 20 dollars for the whole semester.
Meet the terms of the shop in which you borrow the book, including the post for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to provide a normal book of e-books.
Sometimes these books are basically borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most favourable offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, go after business.
Joe Gault, 29, which will soon join Pepperdine Law School, recommends to follow ISBN, because it guarantees you buy the right book.
Before you order the book online, make sure it's actually in stock, Gault advises.
He found out on his own.
The book he bought was born for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from the university bookstore.
The mud, the mud.
And then they found a rifle in the well from the end of the war
The well stands close to the church of St. George.
We discovered the grow around, and we started pulling an airbornenose, about a meter and a half mud and a shiny leaf.
When we approached the grassland day, we ran into the headquarters," Radomil Novák said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it was a torch of attacking German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were made up to the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All wooden designs have spread over time, so it is unusable.
Of course, her body is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did the well get?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown by the people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS units, probably feared not to be removed.
Fascists on the run, they probably wouldn't do that.
They threw guns in the woods," he thinks the finder.
The trigger was the only thing that the thrills from the Duha Jesen Movement found in the well.
"They could have been hand grenades, they used to be around a lot, so we slowed down the dumping work, we carefully looked at the mud to make some misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Newek approached.
The find will end in the depositary of the museum at the castle in nearby Slezské Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: Prisoner Bohemia I have not yet liberated
Exclusive interview Actually.cz with General Colonel Volodymyre Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from captivity of Prorussian separatists.
Kyjev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take this... they're calling me from Doněck," he apologized about eight times in an exclusive conversation with the Actual.cz Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the Centre for the Liberation of Prisoners.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
At any such interruption, it was not possible not to hear the names of people, their counts or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban clarifies with his counter at the second end of the phone.
"It will be it - go there," he ended one of the flash discussions with Donieck, and again he devoted to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is the General of the Reserve, the former pilot of the fighter and an active participant of anti-government protests in Majdan.
Yesterday - when we had an interview - he was in Donieck.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from captivity of Prorussian separatists is devoted to 24 hours a day.
Currently.cz: Maybe you know that on the side of the Prorusian separatists are also fighting Czechs.
Our anti-Intelligence estimates their number to thirty.
Of course, there may be a lot more.
Have you met any Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already liberated arrested Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one of the Swedish, the Georgians... but Czechs haven't yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we ran into your prisoner and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Bohemians who join the Prorussian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers take them?
They should understand that if they fight in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists take them, they will be shot as well as any other stranger after hearing without grace.
Separatists consider these men to be hired by mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
However, if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take a group of convict separatists - and among them, perhaps, Bohemia -, he will take him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian Party is acting in the war as a state.
A.cz: How many prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand well, in exchange.
Some of the sources indicate that it has already crossed hundreds of men.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
We just liberated them... from the war, we didn't save them if they decide to continue in fear.
Saviors are in the war doctors, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's it.
And every day, there are others and others.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners and just a human request.
A.cz: It is heard that in a few months you have gained great authority in Prorussian separatists and even trust... as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides of war?
Hard question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me a nickname "Wacky General with Steel Balls."
I'm not offended.
And maybe that even shows the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officer Choir, I've gained some authority before.
I never master, cheat, and always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the dominion or luhanian very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm simply telling them that they torture them and kill them.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even in the exchange of prisoners, and I've been captured... this job can mean the end to me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.K.: How many executions and torture of captives do you know?
The Ukrainians and separatists are repealed to torture the captives during the interrogation.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
They only take place on the O.R.
I don't have information on the fact that the Ukrainian army also executes the captive.
Not even indications that the Ukrainian army is allowed to do something like that.
We have an idea about the amount of executions, but I can't put numbers and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of Prorussian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also the veterans of Afghanistan.
They're trying to be self-esteem and maybe even democracy in Donieck or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their incredibly opposed opponents - for life and for death.
As we say, they took over their throats.
The same dreams and desires were made by the way in Mayan.
And now I am a little inspected: Russia supports separatists and the West of the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation big and the other is small.
It's already my sentence, but it's a discreet contradiction in it.
A.cz: How do you, for example, appear to be one of the toughest leaders of the Prorussian separatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of war fronts, I'm out of guns and I show soldiers or armed men shaved hands.
And they always have me both sides of those two or three hundred meters on the gun or in the optical focuser.
Those faces of people who are headed at me, I can always see well... and they can squeeze the triggers of their weapons at any time.
The landlord, the experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - a mother - lives in Ukraine.
She believes that Ukraine shouldn't exist.
And if so, just like a little governor in a big Russian empire.
In any case, it talks about it all the time, and Ukraine considers that there was some misunderstanding.
Such a state shouldn't even exist.
At the same time, he is an incompetent enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of the character - in the Ukrainian TV show, you have referred to your Prime Minister Arsenius Jaceňuk as a weak, helpless and tired "instructor" who would do the best if he left quickly.
I'll always be afraid at least five times in the next three hundred feet of walking.
So why should I hide with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak Prime Minister and that it harms our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know that Jaceňuka's Ukrainians are calling "crowd."
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal that would go fear or should respect and authority in others.
His behavior is directly copying the behavior of a rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right in war to cry in Parliament, ask him to play his intrigues with him, threaten to put his function... he has to drive the country, manage it, and protect it during the war.
At risk of the country, Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest for crying emotions.
He's the first of Ukrainian ministers.
And Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the galaxy couldn't save the store
The Sylvester Stallone 3 returned less than 30 million dollars from the US's 90 million budget and Sin City: the woman for which I would only return $12 million from the 70 million budget.
Film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $ 14.6 million during the first weekend and also movies for children like how to train the dragon 2 were disappointment for the movies.
According to the article of the Robbie Collin film criticism in Telegraph, children's films are blamed in their own quality.
Collin referred to 2014 as “the worst” year of children’s films and how to train dragon 2 called simply “functional” by continuing.
When it comes to films put on a little older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films itself.
In July, he compared Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average rating of the summer film premieres broadcasted at at least 2,000 kines in the period between the Day of WW and the 20th July in 2013 and this year.
The results taking into account the views of viewers and film critics suggest that this year's film crop is similar to the quality of last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in the access of viewers can be blamed and a higher popularity of website servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who currently works for Disney's processing of the Book of Jungles, said: “I think times change.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase what's been done.
Unlike the current crisis, the Hollywood casinos gained Netflix due to Internet services $1.2 billion, which is almost twice as much as $837 million last year.
Last summer, he criticized director Steven Spielberg's studio for relying too much on the rights of comics, and foretold the "destruction" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current fall, some commentators declare that something might be on his catastrophic věěry.
With the introduction of possible large cassing markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoň and the Jursky world, other numbers are optimistic in the film industry.
The manufacturer of the X-Men Simon Kinberg recently referred to a decline in the market as simply "cyclical." For Hollywood Reporter said: "The summer of the biggest cash vendors in history will be the summer of the summer and no one will worry about selling."
The KLDR threatens Soul again, exploded another short rocket
North Korea fired another short-sea rocket to the sea, announced Soul.
The prospective test of the missile took place shortly after the end of the joint military manoeuvres of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongjang perceived as preparation for invasion.
Čagang Province lies in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
The speaker of the South Korean Defense Ministry, according to the DPA, said that the missiles were fired from the northwest of KLDR and flew to about 200 kilometres away.
North Korea probably fired a rocket from the province of Čagang for the first time, pointing out the South Korea media with appeals to the military circles.
In the province, there is a subterrestrial launch ramp for Scud missiles.
This is another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in the last few weeks.
North Korea has done an unusually large number of missiles and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, there were protests from NATO’s opposers in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to take part in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the Cardiff City Hall at a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the situation during the weekend and spoke to protesters who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers must have been transported from Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by a plane and transferred to safety after they spent the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheat.
When they didn't come home, the concerned relatives called the police around 8:00 pm.
She was sent to a search unit, including local police and rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around eleven o'clock in the evening.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell down and hit his head.
Police officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable state, they were transported to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
The Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, winning on his leg was yours.
The 23-year-old forvard could have decided, but he failed in two greatest chances.
After the goal, the bullet called close to three minutes before the end, the place in the network, but ended up at the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Květonoň.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," your little ashes fell on your head.
"I think I should have put it up under my lid, it went a little high," he turned over.
The Defensive of Sigma did not allow the Opave much, except for Mikul's arrival from 11 minutes, which, however, covered the goalman Reichl.
Then they started pushing the Hanacs, but they were in the block defending the homes, and the gunshots from the distance caught the Flower.
We've been comparing ourselves for 15 minutes, then we've taken the initiative.
In the second half of time we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava threatened us only from the standard situations.
But the chance he didn't turn out, so it ended 0:0," the coach of Hanák Leos Kalvod.
The opava point was taken because of abstentions in the assembly, where, besides pairs of the injured, Petr Vavřík lacked with three-general shooter Petr Ševčík, who are hosting from Sigma in Slezsk.
Unlike her former politics, it did not allow them to enter.
The replacement deserves a discharge.
Sigma was more soccer, but we didn't let her go to anything except one standard," the coach of the Slezans Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressivity and fighting.
Remise is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got to four points, which means the 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of Josef Lébra Club, who, after defeat with Znojme, conditioned his million-dollar deposit to the Treasury with diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We realised Mr. Lébra's warning, so there can't be a talk about the boys wouldn't want to fight," he noticed Kalvod and at the address of the sleeping shooter your lady added, "I believe it's coming and when he scores, it's gonna start raining there.
But after the first round, I'll set him up right now to save the goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino took the Venice twice.
The Film Festival is a crisis.
After enthusiastic enthusiasm of Birdman's initiating film, whose director Alejandro González Iňárrito was acquainted with the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days suggested that the interest in the 71th year of the festival in Venice had somewhat fallen.
Whether the number of seats in the largest hall grew up to 14 hundred, or because after Birdman, they followed critics recognised, but for viewers less attractive images as a document of genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, the view of silence and other films with social thematics from the American 99 homes to Iranian Talks, there were empty seats in the cinemas.
Heroes of comics
Even the red carpet before the festival palace had not yet been covered by such crowds as in the past, and it allegedly ceased to be the problem to get a place at the last minute in the hotel.
The crisis is spoken more than elsewhere in Italy and it is not surprising that institutions as well as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world have suffered.
Fortunately, the crisis is not a lack of personality, but exclusively related to films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of the representatives of the comic superheroes of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who were successful in 99 homes all of them, for all generations, the main event of the legendary actor Ala Pacina became.
He lighted up the extra in two movies right here.
In the story of the Exemption of the outside of the competition, which filmed the Oscar Barry Levison according to the novel of Philip Roth, the four-seven-year-old Pacino's role that is close to him: a actor at the top of glory that suffers from depression from the end of career and personal life.
But seeing him the second day as a strange owner of ironing from the rural town in the Manglehorn film, which David Gordon Green filmed, it was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best acting performance shouldn't miss it - but does an artist Pacin's format need prices?
Perhaps the greatest satisfactory love for him is the audience, and the Italian especially, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country of his grandparents.
Points for Italy
In fact, the Italian film is doing very well this year in Venice.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first shot of Birdman with a long applause.
The Calabrian base of the mafia is viewed by the view of the family relations between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director managed to align all the assumptions for a good film: quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also took care of a chamber psychothriller Hlad heart that filmed Saverio Costanzo with ora Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost her own child in her pathetic anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not expect warm acceptance, nor the ransom for glory, or 3 hearts, both works leaning on the traditional model of consumer films that oppose the popularity of the acting leaders.
But, after all, two really great films, i.e. Birdman and the Black soul, are not so little at the first half of the festival.
And even though festival pictures have a village of depressing subjects, a new image of Peter Bogdanovich named She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy listed in Venice outside the competition and filmed in American veseloher style for 40 years, she was able to raise the mood for more than one day.
The police caught four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, drug carved from Poland
"The detectives held three men aged 42, 42 and 37 last days, and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold a drug of pervitin in Prague 9 from last November to this August," said the police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First, on Tuesday 12 August, an intervention unit in the Cihlář street caught a twenty-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a seller.
The next day, the detectives were arrested on the basis of the prior consent of the Deputy Attorney of another member of the group, the seventy-year-old man.
The last of the four policemen were caught in the 20th August Wednesday morning in the small-sized incineration area," the spokesman described.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide area of activity.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněva Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitin, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighted the drug, divided into plastic bags and subsequently sold the pervity.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drug addicts, 25-year-old, an unreserved woman.
She received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," said Rössler.
Criminals have also carried out several home tours on the basis of the order of the judge, where they have provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, sacks, syringes, hoses and other tools and objects that can be considered as complete equipment for the production of metamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"The police then found out from the records available that the main organizer has been seven times judged for the majestic crime, the woman judged was not," said the police spokesman.
The last detained was conditionally convicted of a felony of sexual abuse in 2006 and a seventy-four-year-old carmechanic, who is prosecuted for freedom, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly for a majestic crime.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing a crime, unauthorized production and other handling of immutable and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threaten them to 10 years of prison.
At the end of three persons, the investigator gave the state attorney and the motion for imposing a bond to which the judge eventually placed them," the spokesman said.
Fourth accused, seven-four-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case were not as important as the other accused.
The police still work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products for a lot of "intriguing" prices.
As a good example, it will serve in Italy hand-made chess with a 42 x 42 cm gambling board.
If you like it, prepare more than CZK 40,000.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer receives a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered by carbon fibers.
I don't think anyone's gonna surprise that a classic rider has a figure of a hot hobby available.
If your chess do not seem to be a sufficiently valuable gift, there is also a model Ferrari 500 F2 made (i.e. hand) at 1:1,8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318 305.
The interruption of gymnastics and high schools doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics also show that gymnastics have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
Usually, it's routine issues, like transfer the flowerers from summer storage back to classrooms and draw the chalks.
They'll have a little more frmol on the mustard gymnasium.
A few days before the beginning of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or disbelief, the four-year gymnasium in Hóry opened and renewed its activity after three years.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders would be so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of a school to be confirmed by introducing into the register of schools managed by the MŠMT.
"Francouz socialists should shut up and put France in order," says the key ally of Francoise Hollanda
Valls calls for a strongly fragmented left to “show her support” to a fighter-treated socialist president whose new division of function has not been met with the consent of most Frenchians.
The President deserves general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
“Our duty is to remain by his side,” he said and cleaned up applause.
As a commensurate gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 30-hour working week, despite passionate controversy by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Finance, who proposed to relax the rules at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to remain “consistent” with the government.
Christian Taubir, Minister of Justice, made him a line over the budget when she appeared at the meeting of the rebel socialist Members, where the Socialist Party criticized for “Francouzi lost faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, a leader of extremely conservative right, with constant internal disputes between socialists, laughed when she said she didn't assume that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls were forced to build a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen said to her supporters.
She reiterated the call for her party to dissolve Parliament and stated that she was convinced that the party could win the premature elections and that she was ready to drive the country.
The French Government Party suffered in March the municipal elections of defeat and in May the extremely conservative right has succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public survey of weekly opinion Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing into several rival fractions before the end of the Holland term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, politologist of University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon be patient if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It is a limited space for opportunity, but the public opinion must think that there is a change in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and Street Arts Prague will no longer limit the elections
The amendments to the relevant Decrees should prepare and approve the new leadership of the capital.
The streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal choices of another arcade, and the city will not restrict street art.
There won't be even dog walk.
Prague will not reach the October elections to prepare and approve changes in the representative of the relevant Declarations.
"In addition, the decision on amendments should not be made to the current city leadership ending in a few weeks of mandate," said the Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel the gambling on their territory in recent weeks.
Hernis won't disappear, but the gambling declaration is not going to change yet.
It's the task of a new city leadership after elections.
Now, we would not technically have it, for example, given the time limits for the submission of comments and the like," explained Manhart.
He added that the last meeting of the present representative, which must be approved by the Decree, would take place on 11 September.
The referendum on the prohibition of gambling on the day of Municipal Elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
A gambling ban, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the event of street art, the so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1 complains about this, which has already sent the magistrate a draft of places that would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the area of Angela.
The town has been planning a few months for the decree regulating the walk of dogs, not yet completed.
The location of the actors and busking issues solve urban decrees.
They can only be issued or regulated by the representative of the capital.
The councillors only have an advisory voice, they don't give the decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed a victory to the proponents of Scotland independence in reach of his hand
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger that this error would make the third time when she almost put on billboards all over Scotland the question of whether Scottish want to be rich.
But you can't get to the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morale of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, even though few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have far greater tendency to evade the exchangers from the temple than to dictate from them how to vote.
The Chief of Scottish Nacionalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore he repeatedly asked his opponent, unionist Darling, whether he's willing to respect the "suveral will of the Scottish people", if the Scottish voters voted for independence, and started to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
That's what made Darling choose between Scottish civil society and London's financers, and grimasa fall into this trap.
Of course Darling won't support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the debate on what Scotland's currency will have has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defence of state health that citizens have free of charge.
Darling supported the London banker in the matter of currency and raised the impression that he would not protest against health privatisation.
As Salmond said, "He climbed into bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the association of the "boss", to the Confederation of the British industry.
It becomes clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly homeless absent.
Scots would respect him if he had come to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physically hurting him.
What he says is clear: The Scots are not supposed to jump up and have to accept what it is.
The last year is ten months.
Pesimist start of school by Miloš Urbana
Illustration to the Longest Year
Miloš Urban The last year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that's been nowhere, and we've just stabbed and crawled with a grandmother summer, silence before the storm, peace before stress.
New clothes when you could get out of Tuzex, shoes from eastern Germany.
Reading fast arrows, already in the '50s, scattering around the mountain around the Imperial to the back of Vara, somewhere to the tennis courts, no more hot, the sun hung the back and shoulders, knocked the rays on the farewell.
Evening a mild nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleeping at 7:30 a.m., in a week, it's going to be worse, the moment before they fall asleep, they'll be pulling out from a few minutes to two hours, then getting up at 7:00 in the morning.
He's coming Monday.
Mostly it's not raining, vice versa, the summer's scrubbing madly in front of school.
Accommodate yourself in the apparent light on the patch and feel like a plastic figure in a glass tile, there's the school, ZDŠ A.
The attacker with a gloomy pink cast, and before it old famous faces and a few new boys pull out more, girls boobier.
There are bastards out there, they're still interesting how uncommonly they keep together and how soon they're here.
And these adult-looking girls who came crying out now are hysterically laughing, they may have changed something in their lifetime over holidays while everything's in my old place.
And the new first couple, some nerve and others, why are they even climbing here?
Because he has to, educational military compulsory.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned mop schooler, unfortunately, still the same thing that says they're going to borrow the pupil key from the sheet box, where you can leave the textbooks and which are still so little.
A bottle.
The smell of the dress stays in memory, now it's not happening, it's pretty high, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
It's just the idea of the stomach and it's starting to hurt your head.
The head that even worse accepts the work of mathematics, the devil's game for chosen, among which I do not belong and will never be.
The threes and fours again, not the fives, hide from the test, fit into the bench and best sublime, be there, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream stories about the nicer girls and the nicer buildings, the antennas in the universe, where no one is compromising anyone, doesn't humiliate, and he doesn't humiliate anyone's leg.
The last year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
My daughter's birth let her die.
She's a threat to a special punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 at the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without a foreign help, a girl was born, which she wrapped in a ready blanket, hid under the jacket and took it to a road to a bush where she put it into the bushs located several dozen meters from the road.
She was born on her way to school.
I think it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had the need to go to the bathroom on the bus, I had a baby there.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the scissors I wore in school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The following day she returned to the place, the body of the child put in the bag and took it out of the bag, wrapped in the black igelite bag and hid and left it under the staircase of her grandmother's house in Havlíčkova Brod," stands in the lawsuit that it is not entirely obvious when the newborn died.
It could have been in ten minutes, but even a few hours after birth, suffocating when covered by a blanket or inserting under a jacket, underchild or bleeding from an untied puppy.
The same scenario was repeated next year in spring.
A woman in the nearer undetermined period from February to April 12, when a child's corpse was found by random witnesses under the bush at a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, she was born secretly.
This time in the bathroom of a undercrowd apartment in a family house.
Without verifying whether it was born alive, without cutting and tiing the puppy that was twisted around her neck, the child put into several plastic wrappers, including the plastic bag and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he was taken to the pond along with the other partner.
Eventually, a friend gave it to her
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, who allegedly didn't know about the pregnancy of a partner.
For this reason, he is not now in court; he has only been punished for a sin against the law of funeralery.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him being punished as an accomplice.
He was manipulating my child against my wish.
I know my solution wasn't right, but I felt like a human at the time," she didn't hide the arrogance of the defendant, who was allegedly subject and feared him.
During his statement, a young woman spoke relatively balancedly.
The tears in her eyes have led her to the moment when she spoke about the relationship with her parents, from which she left herself after her full - year - old age.
She said she didn't want to kill.
"He's been visiting me every 14 days, doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't get the equipment because I didn't want the kids, I felt young.
I was gonna put him in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do.
I can't explain this to you," the judge answered the question.
However, she refused to act with the mind and intention of the newborn to kill.
According to her claim, the second child was born dead.
She didn't stop drinking alcohol even during her pregnancy.
But I limited it.
And drink hard.
I even reduced smoking," said.
Although pregnancy was seen on both occasions, all of the repeated questions claimed that it had a health problem that it was induced.
And that, my friend.
The main statement will continue with the county court on Tuesday, the statements of judicial experts.
On Wednesday, a judgment might already be issued.
The woman is at risk with up to 18 years of imprisonment, possibly also with exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching the three-milliard purchase of Prestige Cruise
According to the sources known to the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest ship cruise operator in the world, in the prestige Cruises International Inc. purchase negotiations for about three billion dollars.
Trade by Norwegian Cruise, a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with a larger competition of the Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement may be published this week, said the source on Sunday, but pointed out that the negotiations still need to end successfully.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be appointed because negotiations are not public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises have not answered the comments, spokesperson Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise is headquarters in Miami on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's beneficiary was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight trip ships flying to Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, by 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that the nine-nine billion-dollar cruise segment will benefit from the rise in medium-sized economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies are competing for those customers to become the preferred option in selecting trip cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the closing of the 850 million dollar trade.

In 2008, Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
Nor Cruise submitted shares at the exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration of regulatory authorities, at the end of June, Genting had a share of 28 %, Apollo 20 % and a private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documentation of the first public offer, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise included 82 % of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democratical activists in Hong Kong on the day following the decision to vote provoke the Chinese authorities
A group of loyal people were near to Beijing who were waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates participate in Hong Kong elections in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the nomination committee, which will probably consist of the faithful members of Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get to the election tickets and make pro-democratic activists restore the promise and protect the financial center of Hong Kong protests of the “Central Occupation”.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, the Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Peking published in June a detailed report setting the Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, the democratic activists organized an unofficial referendum on elections in the special official circuit and hundreds of thousands of people went to the urban business district and settled it.
The press conference, which will be held by Prime Minister Li, organizes the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, they were also to speak at several press conferences at the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists said they'd gather in the afternoon in front of the office of the Hong Kong Government.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on "State sovereignty"
According to the description of the events by the Russian newspaper, Russian President Vladimír Putin asked that the Ukrainian government stop the fight with separatists in the eastern country and immediately initiate negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the distant areas.
His spokesman Dmitrij Peskov later explained that Putin had not in mind to indicate that the Eastern Ukraine area under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reviewed so that the Russian area would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call for the Cypriot government to act with the Prorusican rebels like the equal ones is consistent with the obvious strategy that follows from the outbreak of the riots five months ago: Help separatists to occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government grant the newly declared Novorusk real independence so that instead of the West can connect to Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television Putin condemned Ukrainian military action to regain the eastern area of Doněcka and Luhanska, which in March and April had been separatists after Moscow, on 18 March, acknowledged the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kreml and separatists recently occupied the territory referred to as ‘New Russia’ or ‘New Russia’, the term which refers to the famous pre-revolutional days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass has published Putin's words, according to which "incarnation of illusions" everyone who believes that there are peaceful negotiations on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians have launched a campaign before parliamentary elections on 26 October, while governmental forces attack civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
“In the interests of people living in these areas, we need to open meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of the society and on the Statutes of the South-East sovereignty of Ukraine,” said.
Peskov said that Putin’s suvergence was thought in the context of a broader autonomy that has been dealing with Kiev’s leadership for several months and which is to mitigate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy can only be granted by the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The stepping of the spokesman Kreml, which was to correct the “unlawful interpretation” of Putin’s notes, underlined the approach of Russia’s leadership to address the emergence of separatists in the east, which is different from the open deployment of Crimea, where most of the two million population is originally ranked to the ethnic Russians.
Moscow should be much more difficult to appoint Doněck and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as most of the 6,5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and the public opinion surveys that have taken place before the conflict have shown wide support for the persistence in Ukraine.
The autonomy that the Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations and, in principle, to give Kreml a genuine control of the territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Krym.
The Black Sea Peninsula acknowledged five months ago is the headquarters of the Russian maritime fleet, the maritime business facility and historical coastal resorts.
Areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also a centre of down, factories and beverages that produce important components for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Porošnko, during his inauguration speech of 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give more control to the various regions of their finances and language statutes.
However, this vision of autonomy differs considerably from Kremla's vision and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to act with separatists like one another equally followed the further procedure of the rebels last week after the Russian units and tanks invaded the eastern Ukraine from the former quiet area along the Azov Sea.
The Russian Separatists have taken over the control of Novoazov with such a force that Ukrainian security authorities are afraid to be struggling with a view to occupying the strategic coastal territory to Krym.
This has succeeded in the great civilian and military effort to reinforce Mariupol, a port with metalurgical combinations by 500,000 inhabitants lying between Novoazov and the narrow entry gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, the jury held a meeting of the European Union leaders in Brussels and encouraged an action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which is independent for the last 23 years.
“We are approaching the point from which there is no return,” warned Porishenko.
In Ukraine, thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council on Saturday to the reporters in Kiev said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after last week two columns of Russian armed vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated into the Doněcké region to support the separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaysk during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday for 10 Russian landlords captive a week ago in the country of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal with revealed photos are involved also Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgusting over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and other powerful Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is shocked after the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrity got on the internet series of explicit photos naked by Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims that he's got 60 photos with a naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanna's singer, Ariany Grande and Ley Michell and Kirsten Dunst's actress.
Due to the escape from iCloud, the personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and the Albanian actress of Grecko have been reported.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who Grecko asked for his hand last month, said the Confidential magazine: “It's disgusting.”
All private correspondences and all private images should stay private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, according to the rapporteurs, told the online newspaper that the hacking was "unstable" and those who became his target, they “look for humiliation.”
It's believed that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots on which he's at the pool.
Palmer, for example, acted in the movie Love and honor where she was Liam Hemsworth's counterpart.
Palmer, a Chuck Strahovski TV series star and an actress from the thriller of Sucker Punch Browning didn't comment on stolen images yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: “It is a clear violation of privacy.”
The Actor Seth Rogen hacker on his twitter criticized: “Advanced photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigmy Footballers have done well, even without winning.
Olomouc - Thunders and Lightnings, which the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigmy Joseph Lébr sent to his subordinate last week, seem to be the past.
If they came from Opava, they only brought a point for a defense-free draw.
After all, the club boss's deployment and fighting just got a little better.
Money for payouts could come to the club soon.
"I don't have another match, as I talked about last week, but I've been far more optimistic," said Lébr, despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, his players convinced it by improved performance.
Fighting and deployment, which we played mainly in the second half of time, was exactly what I wanted to see from players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we were to play this from the beginning of the season, I believe we haven't lost yet," Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava lasted home pressure, then the game balanced and in the second half was better.
After the victory, Calvod's trustees touched, but they didn't reach the goal, so they couldn't win.
The result is not according to our ideas.
We lacked a full satisfaction, but only one shifted chance," said Lébr, but he doesn't think that the change in the approach of football players caused only his threat.
There must have been more aspects.
From my side, by coach or fans," said Lébr.
With pressure, Sigma must count
The players didn't want to comment after the game in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things completely out of here.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl circumcised the head.
Without comment, he left a question of Lébro's statement from last week the attacker Václav Yourček, who didn't trade the greatest opportunity of Sigma in the Saturday match.
After all, he just talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everyone wants to get on us.
Today, we have shown that if we fight and ride everyone in the ass, it will go," he said.
They took warning to their hearts
Even Coach Leoš Kalvoda did not pretend that preparation for the game was not the easiest due to the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lébra's warning took to heart.
Even though it wasn't about not going to fight and blow it off before," the Olemian coach said.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to deal with hardship and realize what the other league is about.
That it's not just about football, but especially about the fight," Kalvoda said.
There's nothing left to hope that Sigma's gonna work from the beginning in the next games.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
