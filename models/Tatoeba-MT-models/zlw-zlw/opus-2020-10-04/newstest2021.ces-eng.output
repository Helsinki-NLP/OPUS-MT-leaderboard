A well-covered Cave at the wilderness in the woods of New Boru was not really a resident
In the north of Bohemia, the Lusatian Mountains, near New Bor, in the Czech Republic, in the forests which led the Hraběcí cesta, covers several sandstone rock units.
Natural and artificial.
And we will go behind this human hand created.
The room is called Cave at the peninsula.
In fact, no postmortem has ever lived here, and the cave serves as a shelter, more precisely the hiding chamber, apparently on grain.
The cave is drained from the side to the rocky cave and accessible up the stairs of the top.
But it's virtually not seen until the last moment.
It will be revealed to the narrow stairs leading to some rock galleries that only enters the rocks.
Although the chamber seems to be far away from the human habitat, it could have been on a mountain platform where the forest is today.
"The fact that this object has no window and neither in the traditional place of the topeniště, clearly proves that no deserter could ever survive the winter here," explains the historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelist Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
A one-space object has only a stone bench in the back, which seems to be used to delocate the containers.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," says Kamil Podroužek.
On the walls of the cave there are visible traces of the instruments.
The deflection of the sandstone with a spider was quite simple and fast for dedicated.
It was sufficient to use the sparrows and the sandstone gradually deflecting.
According to the length of the trace of the spider and the method of sewing, it can be framed to determine the period of cave formation.
According to historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there in these days.
If you approach the cave from one of the forest roads and take you under the cave flowing dumps and near the county road, you will find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be captured by the nearby Havrani rocks.
Žokej Minařík is after a heavy fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
"Filip is in the best hands now.
The institution is arranged for similar cases, and we have a part of the family in Hannover fortunately.
This makes the situation very easy and also care for Finja's daughter," quoted the server Jezzi.cz statement of the Minaříkov's wife Katji.
"Everyone does the maximum, Philip needs time for reconvalescence.
There's no point in giving any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
For financial support of the wounded Minařík called on twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race in Ascot on Saturday, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, which he balanced the legend of Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server, almost €70,000 has been selected today.

The video judge took Sassuol's four goals, lost 0:2
Although the Sassuola Footballs in the Saturday game in Naples got four times the ball into the opponent's goal, they had to accept the defeat of 0:2.
Not one of their goals of judges after consulting the video for the offsaid.
According to the Italian media, it's a record disadvantage of technology, so many interventions that VAR has never died from one team.
"VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him as yet no team.
New technology breaks records," wrote Gazzetta dello Sport in the commentary.
"The Festival of unrecognizable goals of Sassuol.
The VAR has never been so strict on one team before," added Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol took the lead on Saturday at 8:00 p.m., but after half an hour of the game, Sassuolo seemed to have balanced.
But Philip Djuričiče's rock was not recognised after the video-decision intervention for the offsaid.
For the same reason, neither the other Djuričich's intervention and the Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi.
On the contrary, they added another goal.
Electromobiles report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the most in history was charging
"The growth dragged 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging on public stations as well as accelerated development of the registration of new e-auts," said ČEZ Tomáš Chmelík.
Other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, are also reporting their market share, the Tesla electromobile manufacturer, but also the Bill and Lidl supermarkets.
The operator of classical pumping stations is again represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have numbers yet.
"Our network for electromobility we started to build only last year," explained the spokesman of Jan Jusková.
However, the edition of the journal exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
The drivers from the station were taken on average at 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to arriving about 100 kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we forget the small drawing up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then took place in a free tariff.
If the drivers already paid for the collection, their typical loss was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility stretches mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague, all five of ČEZ's most challenging chariots are located in the territory of Prague, which are popularly covered by the entire county towns.
The regions then lead Olomouc.
On the contrary, the least interest is the remote station in the border, for example in Bohumine or in the Prachatices, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
This year's first half, 1274 new e-auts arrived.
In the extensive journal, "These in motion" said eight percent of the readers that they consider buying an electromobile into the family.
But only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their vicinity.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, ecological activists protested

"We have, for example, people who stand up against the expansion of the Turas for a long time, there are people who are opposing the mining of the grapes at the Uhersky Island, there are people who stand against the construction of non-resolute dams," said Marika Volfová.
It pointed out that the main requirements of the protesters are the establishment of a water retention plan in the countryside, a recurrent change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies towards promoting sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is to defend the interests of people, not the careless and devastating business," she said.
On the Malostran square, a petition stand was called by the Czech State's representative to rule on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and renewal of Czech land and landscapes.
These people have been equipped with banners with passwords like "The end of the rupture" or "Coal Mine, more caps".
From southern Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda came from the association for water for people who protest against the plan of extraction of barley in Hodonsk.
"It threatens the drinking water source for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the drills represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned gravel mining is located only about 500 metres from the drills and according to the opinion it is certain that the quality of water will be at risk.

The history of the majority's disease is mild, only three percent of the infected have to go to the hospital.
Either Czech is spreading a mild form of coronavir, or the summer sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious hospitals departments are half empty, even though the number of infecteds are growing.
"This situation today and in April is completely different, and it is primarily given the number of hospitalized," says the Minister for Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth reminding that, on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic was at our disposal, all the gutters were carried out, the republic was closed, and the Czechs used the disinfection for a year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now, the daily increases in the number of infecteds are higher, but every day with covid-19 dies at the maximum of two people.
The highest number of infected populations still has Karvinsko, similar numbers are already in Jihlava because of the outbreak in the local Alzheimercentre, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.

Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson stinked
A big surprise tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh demonstrated excellent performance even in a fight with a player who won the second most prestigious business within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was bilaterally balanced, the break came at the status of 8:7 for the Belgian arrow.
Van day Bergh took a breeze with a 13-shift leg, and since then he was on top.
He literally drowned his game by his opponent and much more experienced "Flying Scot" is hard to get to the doubls.
The way "The Creator of Dreams" had him in his hand, it also shows that the broken Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the 11th leg, in a disadvantaged state, but "he caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the fight, Anderson was seen by a huge frustration.
He was more than just thrown away the whispers, and he was behind the triumph of the walking rival, he was counting completely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of the three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The profit of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable for the Belgian arrow that it is his first won major.
The last player who managed to defeat the Bergha van day is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, accusation for a cathedral fire, a man confessed
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started burning last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original shaft windows from the 16th century and destroyed the organs.
The arson suspects examined the fire from three different places.
At the same time, the police didn't find any signs of getting into the cathedral by violence.
The defendant is a volunteer at a local diocese, a nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then she released him without initiating criminal prosecution.
Now, the prosecutor informed that, on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced arson charges.
In case he's found guilty, he's at risk for up to ten years of prison and high fines.
According to his lawyer, the man of the act regrets and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of the Pandemic Plan in which the government and the Ministry of Health is facing criticism.
"They will, according to the force of community spread," explained the Minister.
He added that, for example, Moravskoslezský kraj or Prague would now reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional because the situation in different regions differs significantly, supplemented.
The Ministry has cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
Individual degrees, according to the Minister, specific measures will be put in place, whether it is the obligation to wear garments or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
In order to establish an epidemiological plan in the programme of the Prima Partie TV, Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), according to which people should have clear information on what measures may expect if the epidemiological situation gets worse.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, even though the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by the fact that nothing essential is happening on the spot to talk about the announcement of an emergency state or the reinvestigation of the crisis staff.
The government, given the growing number of infecteds from Saturday to the whole of the Czech Republic, has once again put in place the obligation to wear robbers on internal events over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now 1000 people.
The government’s procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures and when they would start paying, or when they would be declared, had criticisms.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create a sense of certainty, and the confusion on the contrary," said Senator Marek Hilšer.
Measures may now vary according to the region, for example, from Sunday, for example, in Prague, the obligation to wear sleeves also in non-domestic medical facilities, such as in pharmacies or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear sleeves when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies from Friday also in the Liberec and Ústecké region.
In the Highlands in Jihlavsk it is necessary to wear sleeves in internal public spaces, in MHD and in medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, antiepidemic measures have been released in the Moravian region as well as in the region of Central Bohemia in Kutnohorsk.
The Czech Government has also approved the so-called semafor for Europe in early June, which in color differentiates the degree of risk of disease in individual European countries and thus regulates the rules applicable to the entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In countries with low and medium-sized risks, offices from 15 June do not require a negative test for the Czech citizens on the coronavirus or do not set a quarantine instead.
These are compulsory in returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are in a low-risk category.

If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have hit it.
In the programme of the Prima Partie TV, Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police assessed that there is no need for intervention, and neither did the health station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
The Czech TV (ČT) stated on Sunday that the technoparty expanded to the surrounding land whose owners disagreed with the use of technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will require compensation.
The technicals on the meadow at the Lhota headquarters arrived on Friday night.

However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chance of grieving you isn't too high, she's afraid of herself in normal contact.
And if she has room for it, she likes to go away for a loud crying.
They will only attack if they feel very threatened - for example if you accidentally step on it.
But her afflict is not a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if you have a particularly weakened organism or suffer from allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore mainly in children, seniors and allergies.
"The man has often feeling of vomiting after a bite, sweating, having increased temperature, thirsty, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals and especially allergies can occur to an anaphylactic shock," said Miriam Gredová from the Klatov hospital.

Sapa Market: Razie revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the asanation company," said the State Veterinary Administration.
When checking the live fish stand, it was found that the seller had no proof of origin of the goods and was not registered for sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from the veterinarian point of view for a long time.
For example, last autumn, the veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, there were almost half a ton of unmarked food without evidence of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not found, the part of the products had a longer period of durability and was corrupted.
In five kilograms of sepsis, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.

Putin phoned with the Greens before the opening of the truce in Donbas, Kreml criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke telephonely with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyre Zelený about the situation in Donbas, where he should start paying a new truce since midnight.
Putin, according to Kreml’s statement, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament on the local elections; Kiev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian and Russian negotiators agreed on a new rest of weapons for supporting the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The truce is to start after midnight for Monday, to be "full and general" and to open the way to meet other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin said in the Green talk that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organise local elections is against the peace agreement of Minsk and threatens the prospects of settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Parliament decided last week that the planned elections to local representatives would not take place in the territory controlled by the Prorussian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain the border of Ukrainian occupied separatists with Russia after providing these regions with a broad autonomy and organising local elections here.
According to Unian, the Green Office stated that both Statemen agreed to the benefit of the upcoming truce in Donbas and to the need to take further measures to promote peace in this region, such as the demining of the fight zones or the withdrawal of parts of units from the front.
The Greens also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied semi-trail of Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop the fight, but people are still dying on both sides of the front on occasional shootings and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has been requested by over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West are accusing Russia of military support for separatists, which is denying Moscow.
Zelensky has made his priority from the end of the war in Donbas, but there has not been a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations.

The Rykl had two bronze medals from the outer MCR so far, this time he was the only ten fighter who got across the seventy-nine border.
The next medals were won by Vilém Strásky and Petr Urbanek.
After the competition, he reminded the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sikora.
"It's a shame that the boys weren't here, and Kope didn't set up because it would look completely different.
But the title tastes very well, I appreciate most of the fact that I've given a person 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the bar, and I was most disappointed in the drive, and I was sub-primary there," he admitted on the union facebook.
The first day, the seven-bitch won with more than a stubborn superiority of Kateřina Cachová, even though she was injured by a wounded ankle on a reflective leg.
In the distance sector, however, it only recorded 570 cm, with a blade of 40 meters, and no more to the final eighth.
The new collected 5878 points and won by 241 points in front of Kateřina Dvořák.
It came out first, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wished it would be around 630.
Yesterday, I started pulling the doll, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all, and that it didn't even affect me," Novotna said on a union facebook.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promising ecological operation
Crushed oil gas, a short LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its substantially lower price compared to gasoline or naphtha, given significantly lower excise taxes, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per mile.
Like petrol and naphtha have its environmentally costly variant - "bio LPG".
But it's all new - the European market first appeared in the preceding years and the Czech press release of the Czech LPG has arrived several days ago.
"In these days we have received the first 15 tonnes of LPG bio, which will be distributed in a mixture of classical fossil LPG to our pumping station," quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
Bio LPG cannot be used as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically similar to the classic oil LPG that tanks a number of motorists in their cars now.
Therefore, both versions can be mixed anytime.
"The only difference against classic LPG is the way of production," says the bio LPG Ivan Indráček, the chairman of the Association.
That is also one of the great advantages of the LPG bio compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, as well as the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as an by-product in the manufacture of bioethanol from the residues of food and sugar cane.
In the future, it should be produced targeted, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
On the other hand, the classic oil LPG is partly formed as an by-product for oil refining, partly separated by natural gas mining.
The result, therefore, depending on the production technology and the source of the operation of the car on the bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than on oil LPG and up to 90% compared to naphtha.
But it is not about the CO2 emissions from the car exhaust, but the ecology of fuel production, i.e. part "well-to-tank" (the Czech "from the source to the tank").
Among the largest bio LPG manufacturers currently belong to petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for clean mobility (NAP ČM) it examines the possibility of the production of Unipetrol in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 vehicles are driven by LPG; the Ministry of the Environment indicates a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, about 200 thousand.
According to the Transport Ministry's statistics, nearly 6,000 car reconstructions were carried out last year.
In the Czech Republic, it is possible to fill the LPG at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
Vojtech revised the number of infecteds, the number fell by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the counts infected by the coronavir virus.
New statistics published on Sunday the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday afternoon, the number fell from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 infected less.
There are 3422 patients currently in the Czech Republic.
"As a jump increase in the number of healed, there is a revision of the data that has recently failed to update hygiene," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of medical statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected by coronavir, 11 419 recovered, and 371 Covid-19 diseases were unfortunately undergoing.
Mobile electoral units or correspondential choice.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for variants for pandemic period
In order to vote in a quarantine for coronavir in October and in the Senate elections, there is a need for a change in the law, according to the vicepremiers and Minister of Interior of Jan Hashis (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or in September in an accelerated regime.
He put it on Sunday at Prima's Party TV.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss a solution with representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"No matter what we do, it will have to mean a change in the law of the election," said Hamáček.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister said that it would be necessary to adjust the provisions of the law according to which people in quarantine cannot vote for health.
The prohibition should remain maintained for patients with open tuberculosis for example.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM series stated that the possibility of correspondential elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the House, counts on its introduction for foreign votes, but not in Czech Republic.
At the same time, the prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because it would rather be recorded by other types of parties from correspondential elections as overestimated by experience abroad.
It is then personally against the possibility of an electronic vote where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now ad hoc needs to invent mechanisms (elections) that could be done this year and with as small as possible health risks.
The main then considers it to be ready for the year 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The choice of correspondence (although in foreign or also in Czech Republic) considers one of the functional methods.
As others, the Electoral forces already mentioned or, for example, the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - choices at the time of coronavir - were addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
The spread of coronavir disease has already been postponed this year by various types of elections in 67 countries of the world.
Protests in Buharsk: Pig ears threw demonstrators on the government building
Participants of the demonstration against the Bulgarian Prime Minister Borisov and his cabinet have thrown pig ears on the building of the government.
It was another number of protests against the "Mafia style of rulership" which have been held in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organisers are planning a blockade at the centre of the national government, stated by the DPA.
Today's protest, which took place 18 days after each other, according to the Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom station, had a weaker participation than the previous.
About 300 people were gathered at 8:00, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrants played a theatrical scene in front of the government building, where they symbolically closed Prime Minister Boris's Prime Minister and Prosecutor General Ivan Gsev in connection with the arrest of two president-in-presidents Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The two resignations are one of the fundamental requirements of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the declared health reform and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea Coast.
The Protest Organizer Nikolaj Hadjigenov today in the public radio said that on Wednesday there is going to be a "scattering war" in the form of "celonational manifestation in Sofia and blockade across the country".
He reiterated the request for resignation of Boris and his government, as well as the premature elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has already told us that he will not depart.
It also justified the need for Bulgaria to implement the pandemic covidu-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he traded five members of his government team, even though he had not calmed down the demonstrators.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government continued to vote on confidence in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič doesn't want games without viewers anymore
Football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovič has enough games of the Italian league without viewers.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season, the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're operating here right now is not football.
I'm tired of playing games without viewers.
It's a nonsense football, it doesn't bring me emotions, no joy.
The fights are worse than training.
Playing this is terrible, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks it," said Mihajlovič before today's fight against Lecca.
After the coronavir pause, the matches of Seria A are followed in fast track, and even though they play until evening, their actors are exposed to the heat.
"We play in terrible heat every three days.
In such conditions, they won't even know how the teams are.
It's about to end this season.
These measures had to come to the competition to play, but I hope the fans will be back since September," said the coach, who had led Fiorentin or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajłowice, this season is unusual because the four months on the bench were missing because of the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my disease, the league breaks and everything else, our team managed to move higher.
We want to keep growing and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We became the target of cyber attacks of foreign states, said Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a series of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, but also oil refinery, power plants, factory and businesses.
Some Iranian agents said that a fire that broke in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could cause cyber sabotage.
The reason for a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
The spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry of Abbás Musáví to journalists according to Iranian media said that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic is facing thousands of cyber attacks daily.
He added that it wasn't about a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to reflect.
In recent months, several wider cyber attacks have been reported by Musavia, behind which analyses have been "determined governments and groups".
However, closer details on possible perpetrators did not, according to Reuters.
They also have to add that fires in forests, refinery and other places are often in summer.
The Iranian State Agency article this month discussed that the enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the US, could have been behind recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, were directly accused of concrete attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic relations shortly after the Revolution of 1979 when Iranian military students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostages for 444 days.
Long-term tense relations between the two countries increased in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran which have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the American army killed Iranian General Kasem Solejmania and the leader of Iraqi militia Abu Mahdí Muhandise.
Iran then fired on January 8th at the base in Iraq, where Americans operate, a multitude of rockets.
The United States admitted that dozens of American soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its chief enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjah is the main opposer of the International Nuclear Agreement with Iran of 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb that is denying Iran.

But the streets are gradually floating, especially from Monday, when it's very slow.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed at the hostels.
"In the last two months, we didn't have to deal with almost any problem," Kaspar said.
For example, the Mladodoboleslavská Škoda Auto, which, as a result of the coronavir crisis, also interrupted production, renewed it on Monday, April 27, in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither one of the races works at 100 percent of the capacity.

Art Automotives sell sweat dating, amulet from mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the passing pocket work usually begins with Czech artists.
The images and other works are created directly for art, so they know that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The packaging is always the curator text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can be surprised at what art work he's gaining.
It can now become a new owner of fantastic illustrations of Alexandra Commerce or mini-views from Teresa Bonaventur, which can also be sent.

Pays in health will increase by five percent next year.
Bigger increase according to Vojtěch is unrealistic
Pays in health could increase by five percent in next year, said the Minister for Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in the Questions of Václav Moravec in Czech TV.
The requirement of specialists to increase up to 15 percent considers to be unrealistic.
He also said that he should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective tools.
The hospitals according to him now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (payments) may be somewhere up to five percent," said the Minister.
According to him, the current situation should be reflected in the selection of the coronavir's insurance pandemic and government regulations against its spread since March.
Insurance income dropped at that time.
"15 percent of my increase is unrealistic at this point," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Department of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) are likely to reach 88,312 crowns this year, nurses 47,498 crowns.
The difference between the nurse's payments in state hospitals and wages for other constituents will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data of the UZIS also indicates that the reduction of health nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was in 2019 according to the dates of the Czech Statistical Office 34 125 crowns.
The representatives of the experts have already stated in June that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase by 10 percent, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticise a long-term significant difference between doctors' earnings and nurses in state hospitals, which must be followed by payment tables, and contractual wages in hospitals of cities, regions or private areas.
They therefore also require that they be united for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
In doctors, for example, wages increased faster than wages last year.
According to President of the Czech Dental Chamber of Roman Šmucler, professionals should see how the state is at present.
The House recently, due to the impact of the epidemic, has approved the increase in this year's state deficit to a record of CZK 500 billion, from which 1,75 billion is to be paid to health care professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Healthcare Providers according to Šmucler disagrees with the payment increase in land in the next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be determined by the hospital itself and health facilities, and additional money should go through the paycheck.
Vojtěch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective help.
The chairman of the Administration of State Resources (SSHR) said this week that the administration does not currently have one protective health aid.
He's waiting to complete the selection procedure.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to supply goods better than in March when they were redemptioned.
According to him, he should try to be self-sufficient and buy from Czech companies as well.
Sneaky smart quarantine could take over soldiers.
We're ready.
"The quarantine works, it's something to improve of course.
We'll discuss it tonight with the army.
The army works perfectly and is the question of whether they should re-run the whole thing," said the Prime Minister on Sunday in his Facebook show hey people.
According to it, IT systems and hygiene stations cannot be sufficiently connected, which must gradually go to more modern methods of operation.
The problem was, according to the Prime Minister in the Moravian Silesia region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of epidemics.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek for ČTK stated that it does not have information on Sunday's negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army's ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project took over the Ministry of Health May 25th.
Until then, a smart quarantine led a 90-member central control team set up under the army as a government advisory body, who led former Minister Roman Prymula.
The vibrant project criticized the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Even he said that the army could take him again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously granted by the governmental attorney for IT and digitalisation of Vladimír Dzurilla, who is responsible for it.
"The system works, but it's still working on.
Twenty years have become independent and non-systemal, now we're trying to unite in a few months.
It's not a jet.
The people on the march, the poor on the hygiene on the march are adapting the new systems and actually picking up the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Prime Minister Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "crap in politics"
The current Ostrava primate Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not be running in the next Municipal election.
The reason for this is the attempt to "nezbit in politics," said the server Respect.cz.
The Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of Move, ANO, is the primator of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 Municipal elections, the led candidate of the movement ANO in Ostrava received almost a third of the voters.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd keep one term of office, and with the business experience, I could turn everything around and build on my feet," said Respect.
He added that for the second election period he had to speak to some extent.
"But it's the best for me.
I don't want to fool in the politics," he added Macura, who said himself in the conversation that was a tough introvert who doesn't fit in common contact with people.
According to the Respect, he has been speculating on Macur's possible end in an ANO movement for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for the alliance with the SPD movement or for the support of Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities, yes, he supported the elections of Zeman's anti-Candidate of Jiří Drahos.
From the ANO movement, which he entered in in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"When I feel like I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely vain fight, and that no one is casual, I have no immediate motive to end," Respect said.
Sixty-five years old Macura graduated from the High School of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura worked, inter alia, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also settled in the organs of other companies.
Returns to Brno to Uber offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will be returned to Brno by the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, said on Thursday in the press statement of the Council for Transport by Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Against Uber in Brno, the taxi drivers protested, pointed out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as the name as a taxi or taximeter.
However, as of July, the conditions for the operation of common taxes and alternatives have changed.
He held several meetings with representatives of Uber over the past few weeks.
"On the basis of them, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is a result of a change in the law which enables this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services in the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
They protested taxi drivers against him for not marking vehicles as a taxi or a missing taxametre.
The court has issued a preliminary measure which has banned Ubera to ride in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, last year but prime minister Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would want to take steps to make Uber in Brno.
According to the judgments later, Uber was able to ride in Brno, but the company didn't use it.
He will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July it is true that, besides classic taxi, a lamp and a taxametre, transport service can be operated more easily and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too much fabulous party in Brno: flying chair fell a meter away from a man on the sidewalk

Revoke request Rafaje will discuss Babiš with ČSSD
The Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss the request for a call from the head of the anti-monopoly Office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafai on Monday.
In order to appeal to Rafai, non-profit organisations invited the government’s counter-corruption council and also the Ústigian Region.
Social Democrats point out that the exchange in the head of the Office is in place.
According to ČTK Rafaj, he wasn't invited to the Government Office for Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of next year, according to the law cannot be appointed thirdly.
His appeal is in charge of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with similar requirements from the Ústecké Region.
The reason for Rafai's recent causions, among other things, is that.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to express his request to meet the materials and the governmental parties to take a "some opinion".
He also pointed out that he had not dealt with the President yet, he has not agreed with him at the very earliest time.
According to the statement of the OOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafai was not accused of anything.
IHNED.cz and Aktually.cz servers in the past week have written that the police are interested in Rafai's appointments with Jiří Čunk.
Meetings have put in connection, among other things, on the decision to compete for the project, a controversial new Zlin hospital for eight billion, which Čunek strongly enforces.
The chick admitted to the meeting, according to him, they were dealing with his "senate activity."
Likewise, Rafai speaks.
Representation of the Ústecké Region to appeal to Rafai has called upon the government at the end of June.
He also asks for a reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the UOHS on public contracts according to the Deputy Hejtman for Transport Jaroslav Komínka is not transparent and has signs of vulnerability.
Last March, the police intervened at the antimonopoly office because of the myth tension.
This year, in June, the server Aktually.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses the apartments written on the company of a powerful behind-the-the-spot player of the ČSSD Alexandra Čuba.
The $3.5 million deposit for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafai's account.
The Chairman of the Competition Office has been Mr Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the President of the former Social Democracy was appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafai's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antimonopoly Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the government.
It may only be withdrawn if it does not perform the function for more than six months or disrupts the dignity of its function or independence and impartiality of the Office in a serious way.

The problem was also regularly found in a cultural room on lectures visiting dozens of people.
After a few minutes there was no breathing," said Propa.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to make air conditioning this year in all the premises of the library.
In the end, there will be only three circuits of five.
"For limited funding, the air conditioning will have only the most likely areas.
Study and reading on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and the children's department are above the floor," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blanen investment union.

Moreover, according to the owner of Michal Mičky, the time of new and old collections and the blind follow-up of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"There are many traders with discounts already counting on the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
It's actually a bit of a fraud," says the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business as well.
"Everything our product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We put emphasis on the large part of our collection being formed of the so-called basic pieces - i.e. the clothing that is overtime and overseasonous.
The world is a segment of premium brands absent by any discount typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and no discount is necessary," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti represents the RAF flight Kurt Taussiga
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city leadership suggested," said Vacek, who completed his work after 14 days of intense creation.
He used about 300 liters of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shan.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, the Nazis dragged him to the boarding camp, where they held him for weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholase Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig reached the UK, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then he performed a pilot training in South South Rhodies and Palestine.
He joined the battle operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the velvet revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and the Native Teplices, which gave him honorable citizenship.
Sixty-four-year-old Kamil Vacek, whose people in the street graphic art business have known under the nickname Camo, have been working with sprays in the heat streets for over 20 years.
With graffiti, he began on the areas that for these purposes had been assigned by the former primator Jaroslav Kuber (ODS).
Hanna's storm arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight SELČ at night for today) arrived on the southwest coast of the state of Texas.
He hit Padre Island of Texas, about 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, and during his movement over the mainland, he weakened on a tropical storm.
According to the meteorologists, however, it represents a great danger to the inhabitants of the coastal areas.
He brought with him a strong wind and intense fall; along with local floods, the AP has reported electricity failures and various material damages, including damaged ships.
The Texas governor Greg Abbott has already declared a natural disaster on Saturday for 32 counties in the southwest of Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning has been given by people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay, but the living has to strike the territory of nearly 500 kilometres before it gradually moves over the northeast Mexico.
"As Hanna is now a tropical storm, they can have a strong rain and wind, rises of levels, dangerous charge and unique tornado represent a threat," warned the American National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, the local time (afternoon SELČ) was moving in the area of americko-mexic border and accompanied by a wind speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic.
A wind of up to 145 kilometers per hour was followed above the Mexican backbone, but he gradually weakened it to 112 kilometers in an hour, which has removed Hanna from the category of hurricanes again.
The local authorities called for storms to wait at home and not to forget hygiene measures related to the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to those American states that have pandemic diseases covid-19 suspicious most.
In view of the existing security measures and the need to comply with the distances, there are a major challenge and possible evacuation.
The provisional shelter was opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Hidalgo district of Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test on the coronavirus or were exposed to disease in another way.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated to take their clothes and disinfectants, if possible.
"We don't even have that far behind us yet.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted by AP Chris Birchfield, who works for the National meteorological service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts claim that in some places, up to 300 millimeters of precipitation could rain within a few hours, in some cases not only 500 millimeters, which, together, could flood a number of sea levels on the coast.
Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Lipk
President Miloš Zeman, on Wednesday, will lend the general rank of Colonel Pavl Lipk.
It comes from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for lending the rank of Brigadier General is the August entry of the Leipzig to the post representative of the commander of the allied multinational division of the northeast in Poland.
Leipzig is still a representative of the Czech Army Land Force Commander.
The promotion of Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, the Brigadier General Karl Řehk will replace the position of the representative of the commander of the northeast division in the Polish Elblag, which commandes the units of alliance predecessed presence in Poland and Pobaltí.
In March he became the Director of the National Civil and Information Security Office (NÚKIB).
The government suggested that the President lend Lipk the rank of the Brigade General.
In accordance with the law on professional soldiers, a higher rank may be loaned to the soldier for the duration of the function chosen or for the duration of the service task required for the lending of a higher ranking.
The Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall be responsible for the general ranking.
The soldier whose rank was rented has the same rights and obligations as if he was appointed to this rank.
However, he does not have the right to adjust the remuneration that would correspond to that rank.
The borrowing of the rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted.
" Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional preparedness and is a model for subordinates.
In an important way, he participates in the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and security of the participation of the army in foreign operations," said the Ministry of Defence in June to the promotion proposal.
The medieval promotion will take place at 12:30 at the Prague Castle, the Minister for Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of the General Staff of Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for flight travel to help reduce the spread of the new coronavir.
It was announced by the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards, compliance with the distance or wear of the ropes on the plane and at the airport, however, the middle seats on the planes will not have to remain unsettled.
Reuters informed about this.
"I am glad that my colleagues accepted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that ministers still have to formally approve it.
The agreed measures shall include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from six years old, to comply with the recommended departure during security checks and the airport clearance.
In flights, enough fresh air must be guaranteed and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to settle the middle seats.
The common rules on which the officials have agreed shall meet at least certain requirements of the airline companies.
Different standards have caused confusion.
On the Arctic Spicberky, the temperature record fell, measured almost 22 degrees there.
"In Longyearbyen, a 41-year-old record fell," said the Norwegian meteorological institute on Twitter.
Undernight, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, thereby overwhelming the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand thousand longyearbyen is the largest town on Špicberky, located about 1300 kilometres from the northern pole.
Butterflys are heating faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other ends of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, is reported last year's report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature on the Špicberky increased by three to five degrees from the 1970s.
By 2100 it can even rise by ten degrees unless greenhouse gas releases are reduced to the atmosphere.
The growth of temperatures can result in everlasting frozen land on Špicberky, which will jeopardise the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and it can cause more benches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic Fauna, such as ice bears or tunas, who are dependent on the ice blanket of the ocean.
British returning from Spain a compulsory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all pathways to land Spain that are not necessary for the risk of spreading covid-19 diseases.
The Canary and Balearian islands are not mentioned, however, even after their return, people must be in isolation for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have adopted this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," said the British diplomacy in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she added.
According to the British Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of British.
Spain belongs to a very popular holiday destination.
The British, among other things, are concerned about whether the sickness will be paid to them if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after their return.
For example, Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne ordered a ten-day vacation on Lanzarote, they were supposed to leave on Tuesday.
They have been ordered since December.
"We were supposed to go to the whole family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a engineer, and I don't think my employer will admit that I'll be back from my vacation for two weeks in quarantine," quoted Metro Hunter's journal.
In connection with Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the last two days there has always been over 900 newly infected in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening the coronavir measures, such as Catalan, are trying to reduce all the night lives and to prevent people from meeting in a great way.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of diseases in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque and Madrid.
The Dukovan electricity redemption model will discuss the government
The government will discuss on Monday the model of redemption of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovana Nuclear Power Plant.
The proposal for a law counts that, in the event of a ransom price higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will pay all consumers by means of tariffs.
In the second case, when the ransom price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be reverse.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for customers.
The Vice-President and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (ANO) and the ČEZ Energy Company have previously stated that more likely the option is that people will save electricity thanks to the construction.
In contrast, analysts point out that the long-term view of electricity prices on markets is always uncertain, which has shown several times in the past.
The aim has already been criticized by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be both under the market price of the electricity, and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact shall be distributed between customers according to the size of the securitizer - at lower consumption or electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO).
In May, he stated that the wholesale price of electricity would increase and the people on the construction of Dukovan would make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per family will be much less per year than people pay annually for electricity in the invoices to support the so-called resources supported.
He previously estimated that the ransom price could be between EUR 50 and EUR 60 (about CZK 1320 to CZK 1600) per megawatthodin (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, to be included in the Purchase Treaty.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, which is now most supplied by traders, is currently around EUR 45 (about CZK 1190) for MWh.
"In the difference in the ransom prices and the market prices of power electricity of 10 euros, the average household salary with consumption of 3,3 MWh could correspond to a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances, including electric heat plates and ovens, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - not less than 100 CZK/year," wrote in the subsidiaries for the MPO government.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavir pandemic showed us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices as a highly speculative matter," the CEO of the Energy Financial Group said Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law counts that the redemption of the MPO would have been carried out by a legal person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions for the redemption of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, longest, until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as a production of electricity with a nuclear reactor attached to the electricity system with a minimum power capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new dukovana block should have the power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodins of electricity annually, which would correspond to the 10 expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The model of financing the new ducovan block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed annually, with a two-procent interest on the operation.
With the funding model, the opposition is disregarded by the possibility of Dukovany building Russian or Chinese companies.
It should be 70 percent of the construction.
The rest should pay ČEZ, which will also cover all additional costs.
The CEO of ČEZ Daniel Beneš in May of the Czech Republic said that the expected total of the building of the block at current prices is about EUR 6 billion (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the State and ČEZ on the construction of the new ducovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has withdrawn Turis Support material for two billion
The material according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic two billion crowns, the Office withdraws from the reminder procedure.
Ms. Klára Dostálová (ANO) server ListNews.cz said that the material is still working on.
The document in eKlep (Electronic Legislative Library) pointed out on Friday the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry of Plan justified the fall of travel because of coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, the media and revenue declines were recorded.
The proposal called for opposition criticism as well as representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the web hlidacstat.cz, the IMR planned to provide money through the State Agency for the promotion of tourism in CzechTourism on advertising in TVs, radio, press, on the Internet, billboards or flats on the stations.
The biggest part of the money is 700 million crowns to get TV.
Most of them would get private television Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weekly dailys would receive 400 million and the same section would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
The radio station would have received 350 million for the media campaign, most of it's private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and flats at stations or in metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last a year.
"It is still working on the material, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented yet," said the Dosalová without further details of the listNews server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéty Pekarová Adam would benefit from the advertisement by the media from the Trust Funds Prime Minister Andrei Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this vicious contempt gets in autumn at the elections of the morning between the eyes," she wrote on twitter.
Sufficiently, she refuses that it's actually about helping the media through the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about supporting the media," said on Friday Journal N.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"We're counting it, of course, may be less or less.
It's a work material," she added.
Initiative, let us save turism does not give a media campaign to support domestic turism.
"We want two billion companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said the president of the initiative Tomáš Barčík on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, companies, not media, write the initiative in an open letter to the government.
The curtain of life, the cock of beer and death like the steak of grass
After death is also a third album called And death is a steak of grass of the Brno poet, an unfair organizer of cultural activities and publishers of Jaroslav Erik Friche, who left also on May 24, 24th.
In Fricho's discography, the fifth item is, and the same as the previous titles, here is the main emphasis on Frich's poetry, which is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, the year of 1949, of course, was influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passionate through his own personally provided experiences and also very low expressions of faith.
But it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God.
In this context, I think about Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast, for example, Jan Zahradník), the masters will pass.
Frič's album offers records of the 2006 reading, but also the performance with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cello Joseph Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and the Winners of Holata.
I would like to help myself - in the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poems.
"Safe of them was proud and no endless bitterness," says Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened by disappearance.
The world, which falls increasingly into unkind consumer vanity and county, is increasingly distant from what his soul has been created - from the secret of faith, humility and human proximity.
He called in them a steak of those who know that the values for whom he was created are not interested, but who also knows that only because of their general concern cannot be ruined.
These poems reminded you that a person might have to lose everything expensive, but it's not important how he'll lose it.
If he becomes a general bankrupt, he resigns sceptically, he will be silent, or he will remain in the last moment in a quiet and proud duration of what he believes and what he loves."
Paroubek is not my counselor, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the Czech Republic Jiří Paroubek is not a paid consultant for social democracy.
The Chairman of the Party and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamáček said that on the Prima Party TV show today.
About the fact that Paroubek should be Hasas adviser, he informed the server ListSprávy.cz on Friday.
"Sometimes, we're gonna write a text from time to time, he'll send me some material, and I'll read it," said Hamáček today.
He added, however, that this is not about official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD has no means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion is so many of them," he said.
In the subsequent discussion with Ms ODS Jana Black Minister said that many ODS members are still "incredibly listening to the views of Václav Klaus."
He believes it's okay because it's an experienced politician and an ex-president of the party, which is also a Paroubk case.
The fact that the media make it an affair, he referred to as a sign of this year's cucumber season.
Server ListZprávy.cz on Friday wrote that Paroubek performs the role of Hamáčkova unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party’s candidate in the oral region is headed by the former President of the cell there, Petr Benda, who is connected to Paroubko and has been a Vice-President of his LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until she's finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, it's a kick in the ass, he's running the Swedish caller.
Just a 22-year-old American sticker has ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to be two years younger than Duplantise defeated, and last year, he's defeated him as an NCAA university association.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won, and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who has secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But since then, Duplantis has shot the steak up, and at the moment, he is alone in the highest barber spheres.
In only 20 years he became a world recorder, this year, on February 8, in Torunia, he overreacted the line of 6,17 meters, a week later in Glasgow, added an inch.
"Skaked six meters in 18 years when he graduated from high school," he recalls his Nilsen peer for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy in a man, all his potential and talent will multiply.
Twenty years is quite a good age to jump the world record," he believes.
If Nilsen's success record is thinner than the one Duplantis proud, the American is setting similar goals.
In February this year, he improved his internal personal record at 5.93 m. In August, he won a gold medal at the panmeric games in Lima, and in 2017 he fought for an American World Championship, where he ended 13.
Then the nearest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It is my priority to get on a professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same in events like the Olympic Games, the world championship or the Pan-American Games."
However, because of pandemic, these peak holidays are delayed, which gives Nilsen and other barkers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up to Duplantise, which can easily turn the race under five circles into just a fight about silver?
"Everyone's trying to catch him, but I don't think it's gonna be possible soon," Nilsen thinks.
"This kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of everyone else."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he's gonna want to increase it.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of insecurity pensions of an incapable of a son.
She's on trial.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from a state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
For disbelief, a woman is at risk for eight years in prison.
Because of the bad condition, the court of the sick man of his rightfulness has disposed of, and his mother has set up a guardian to manage the money of his son, among other things.
"Family, from mid- November 2013 to this January, used part of the money from the inseparable pension of her son for her need and prepared it by 440," said police spokesman Dana Ladman, complaining to the accused woman that she had a special duty to defend the interests of the injured.
The woman, according to the order of court, set up a bill for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the cost of a son's stay in a medical facility and paying the necessary medications, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of vehicles, electrical appliances and for the conduct of the household," stands in the prosecution.
That he can't use his son's money for her needs, the woman admitted.
But she fought by forgetting them when paying family expenses.
"We had problems with our income to tighten our household walk.
We've never bought anything superstandard.
It was always on things that the son would have approved.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," explained the woman to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been settled for 30,000 years, says scientists after finding tools
The findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican State of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, among which are also fine blades, which could be used to cut meat, and spicy objects that could serve as rods of vaccinations or copies.
Scientists found that the oldest of the tools came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said the archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies that were published on this topic in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite caves, located at a large altitude, have lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely recognized theory spoke about the first representatives of the genus Homo sapiens crossed the main bridge from today's Russia to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique hills used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clavia culture was subsequently expanded in a large part of North America.
But this model has been cracked in the last decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different locations are written across North America, proving human presence on the continent from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American land before it was expected.
Some could have gotten to America.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the so-called clovia culture was developed," said Ruth Gruhn from the University of Canadian Province Albert.
The interest in the tickets is so far filled with an optimistic scenario, claims the sellers.
Prices are gradually reduced as well.
Sales of flights in the Czech Republic grow every week.
Contrary to last summer, the interest is still about half a year, but demand is growing by 20 percent every week.
Developing after the crisis, according to the dealers, is thus fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Prices of flights are gradually reduced.
The most sought destinations include, in particular, the Sellers of South European States.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At the Letuška.cz portal, flights are sold most to Croatian Split.
The United Kingdom is the most sought out of other countries, which, of course, belonged to the most difficult destinations ever.
The average price of the tickets is also reduced.
At the Portal of Letuška.cz, around 6250 crowns were around the mid-month, annually 3,000 crowns less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which are now about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices are down to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, in recent weeks, about five.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets with a much smaller advance than before, because they are concerned about further development of the coronavir situation.
According to the earlier information Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of a flight has decreased by approximately ten days before departure.
"This confirms us the future trend when people will order tickets with a much smaller advance, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said the vice president for Kiwi.com products Michal Šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
The number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic also increases with the growth of sales.
The Prague airport currently operates regular lines up to more than 60 destinations.
It's about half a destination against the summer season last year.
The big finale is tonight!
Watch the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has reached the big final.
It introduces an experienced nine-year-old Scottish arrow Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a sixteen-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson took Justin Pip out on his first round, then he ran into his neighbor in the table ladder.
But even James Wad did a good job, and he fought with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home the world's number one in the fourthfinal.
"Flying Scot" had a hard time in the semifinals when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the tomb from the shovel, dominated in the prolongation, and after the 18:16 result, he fought a place in the tournament final, which was held in 2018 when he defeated Mensura Suljovich 21:19 in a wonderful battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and perhaps knowing that he had nothing to lose, helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
The sixteen-year-old arrow first surprisingly eliminated the world's six of Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle pushed Jo Cullen, and in the fourthfinal after the acute approach, Adrian Lewis was underwent.
The big check was semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength to the introduction, but in peace playing Belgian then gained a fine series of lead, which he then kept more or less without problems until the end.
Van day Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which threatened occasional insecurity on doubles.

Health harms air refreshers and deodorants
Health threatens not only the poor quality of air in the outdoor areas, but also at home.
It was noted by the Israeli experts on the human health of Carol Abraham, already quoted the journal The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environment, it is necessary to focus on the harm in households right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the US Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the countryside.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that 3.8 million people die annually because of bad air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavir epidemic, which has made many and still forced to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in the homes," said Abraham.
In Israel, the quality of the "domestic air" has almost no interest in anyone.
Dangerous may be things with which humans usually come into contact - paints, air refreshers, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The united gas also issue clothes that we regularly wear in the dry cleaning room," said Abraham.
The most threatened are children, old household members, and people with respiratory problems.
In other words, health may begin to suffer problems such as headache, fainting, irritability in the nose, nose bleeding, vomiting or skin allergy.
In the long term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all harms come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which houses are built.
