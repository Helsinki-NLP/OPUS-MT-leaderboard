There's a great return to the Czech loser.
Paul the Frenchman was called to the NHL
The Czech Hockey goalkeeper Pavel Frenchouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
Thirty-year-old Pilsen Natives will be on shift, and soon he could get into the gate.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzně or Russian Čeljabinsk has been injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the Vegas game, and since then, he has not been presenting himself at the NHL slides.
An incident occurred at the moment the experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to another.
“Pavel Frenchouz will be out of approximately three to four weeks with injury in the lower body,” announced the whole of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal finally extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning the American time was called from a farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL he added 94.5% of the actions.
The resurrected Pilsen hockey wants to finally move in and confirm that it belongs to the best league of the world.
In his last year he had problems with his hips, and he didn't catch a single game in a short pandemic year.
In the NHL “Frank” captured 36 games, its success of action is at 92,3 %.
Charles on Christmas Wishes Camille's rope, William and Kate posing in Jordan
The British Prince William and his wife Kate, as this Christmas wish, selected a family photograph taken during their journey to Jordan.
He also published his wish, Prince Charles, who used a photograph on which his daughter Camille helps to put a sleeve.
On its website, the British intelligence station of BBC informed it.
Wishes send to friends, collaborators and the foundations they cooperate with.
The photograph was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte has dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just as Princess George and Louis scrotum and shirt.
Who did not take the photograph, William and Kate, is not even clear when it was formed.
Last year, the royal family for a photograph designed as a Christmas wish posed on a package of straw before a pile of wood in its rural residence in the county of Norfolk.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas wish, also published the successor of Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Sam Hussein's picture captured them in June at the Ascot Appetizers.
Charles, who's got a cylinder on his head and a cloak on his face, helps Camille wear her sleeve colored with light dresses.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption caution allegedly worked with the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr had since the Prague Slavia promised a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz that he got into part of the police files.
The chairman of the Headquarters of the Jaroslav Tvrdík Chairman said that there was no red-white corruption act.
The server published a transcript of police wires in which Slavia is mainly her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended last summer in the master club.
Somewhere the influenced red-white functionor was in common contact with Berbr and the former sports manager at the time of the second-linguistic investigation of Roman Rogoze, which is also in the case of the accused.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro promised a financial reward for getting a title.
2019 won team SK Slavia Prague title in the first league.
The police authority has had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) is to be held for winning the league from SK Slavia Prague officers, promised a million-year bribe, quoted the server from the list.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the Board of Directors Slavie Hard.
According to the server's file, the police are still dealing with this information.
The hard guy refused any corruption.
In 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the ratios in Czech football and offered a opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal negotiations, did not attempt to influence judges in breach of fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial executions in this context," stated the Prosecutor for the List of Reports.
In the posts, among other things, Nezmar does not selectively insult some former players of Slavia dark skin and also obeys his former Chief of Harden.
The Kauzu of alleged influences of the fights through the arbitrators started police interventions in several places last mid October, including the Prague FAČR headquarters.
The most built in the aphere is Berbr, who no longer graphs in any of the football functions.
In mid January, as well as former sports director of the Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle worse type (the shooters must wear hand-free bullets from the panther cabin).
Cars - Toyoty hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armor vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, we have already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: fighting- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - too small with short bottom, but modern.
Drony - few and only small types without fighting potential
Rockets - we don't have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a chase right next to the city.
They climbed out of the river's nutritions and did damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that on the coast of the river he was a fisherman.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sit down, and I guess the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course, there was a fox coming in a while.
I let her come at 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost fucked up, snitched his head on all sides, so I called him, that was on the fox.
Before I got out of the seat, he was gone.
I mean, the meadow of a man to be a prey.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of a lot of coincidence to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermovie that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, you'd be able to keep your salad data on your feet, and you should be fine.
Soldiers versus Hamáček.
Inside, respirators got significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of sleeves, masks and respirators for the profession closest to the coronavir, has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amount of respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which offices have been treated in the economics?
And why did others buy irritation?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to editor of the server iRozhlas Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (I am not affected by the memories of the CSLAs that have experienced older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory army.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can be trained, we don't actually have modern techniques or existing professionals, and modern techniques are still more complicated, so the capability of the founders will be rapidly lost in time.
To this modern conventional conflicts where anyone can enter, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to practice someone again.
And finally, the founders/teritorial defenses are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where they go to lead a mass geril and it is also a pronounced necessity to dissuade the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, the fight will only be held in conflict with such scale and intensity, where gerila will be irrelevant, and we do not have an appropriate geographic.
We don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them plays like they have it.
That's the situation that you're looking like a loser who didn't hit the empty gate back for two minutes, attacking himself between two or even three steeps, and you're calling yourself "twinning, and what do you think will happen now?"
Well, of course they're gonna take him out like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "provoke a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself sincerely surprised when I see that our attacker was able to play one of the players.
First flags
Covid's pandemic slows down, but experts don't expect a major twist for the next few weeks.
Resistance in hospitals according to statistical models will last some time and the pandemic equation has arrived, as known, new unknown: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the pandemic equation of Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, as much as it helps vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by the previous disease.
But the unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
New drug, molnupiravir antiviral, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe illness and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by a paxlovid medicine from Pfizer, which has already reported success even 85 percent.
The first delivery of the molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, excluding the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in combating the coronavir pandemics, highlighted the question of how the incoming administration is ready.
As it was said, the first of the domestic patients will get the mellnupiravir of Merck.
The company ended up on the belt as first and because the medicine began to develop long before the current pandemic has evolved in order to find appropriate treatment for viral disease horses on the South American continent.
These research often forget that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
At the same time, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "how the beak grew".
See, you're gonna do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will say no.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we are Czechs, racist shit.
And then they go and vote the parties like the AfD.
He's afraid of canceling culture, saying this in public means losing work and the media lynch.
Then it looks nice, west good, east bad.
But they will really find out what people think.
It's only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, they both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that the objects in Czech are three and completely identical.
Identical because of unit spinning so soldiers don't have to learn again where they are, so all the objects are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, ssr didn't want a nuclear head in its own territory because of the safety or speed of the headset because of the west position.
In these underground covers (in each of the maps are two) only warheads were preserved, not whole rockets, as they say.
If you had to put this weapon on, a special unit came to pick up this head and set it up on some device.
Besides the museum maple, the left ones are in desolate condition.
At the second grade of the primary school, we had a classmate of Cigan, we've been with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he was doing good jokes, and he was often too much, but it was our mascot.
Everyone was talking to him, often dating and wanted to explain something, missing a little, walking regularly, sporting with us, not stealing snacks, or phones, walking purely away.
He used to go to schools in nature, make a variety of monkeys, but he was fine, maybe never a shit.
In the eighth or nineth grade, the siblings, the cigars, the other class.
Shortly, they beat the teacher, dealt with something there, threatened and threatened the other students.
I personally sell something for an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I've been selling to the Cigans, money always had, they didn't try to draw me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called in a month, he's already rewrited it on himself.
I'm talking about myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if anyone's white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, until he's acting as a decent society (works, works, women doesn't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes up, stretches his hand, resides apartments and houses, has just a mess around, makes trouble, so it doesn't matter what my color is, but I don't mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If he believes in Allah, I don't care if they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash on the Prachatico
“A young woman suffered a serious multiple injury, and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she suffered from her injuries on the spot,” said Zuzana Fajtlová.
Havaria probably caused the driver who drove the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and from the undetected causes went out in the corner to the opposite direction.
After the collision with Skoda Octavia, the vehicle of Peugeot ended up on the roof outside the car, described the accident of the spokesman of the South Bohemian Police Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver Peugot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
It was multiple injuries and remained enclosured in the car.
After the release, he had to be provided acute pre-intention care, and in a stable state he was airborne transported to the Czech Republic hospital, as stated by the rescuer Fajtl.
She added that a man in the second car suffered a lighter chest injury and was transported to a hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, and customers often do not provide data about them.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times in a month.
He primarily collects collectors' cards.
“It can usually be tens of dollars, let’s say from $10 higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free,” the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has been slightly delayed, the new VAT must be added and mailed to the customs procedure.
He's gonna get an e-mail with a message that the customsmen are expecting a package coming.
It shall then be sufficient to fill in the consignment data and if VAT has not included the merchant at the time of sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount per shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not secure the customs procedure itself, the total amount must also be added to the carrier’s remuneration.
According to Luke Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna shut down one or two bars, put in two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all the shipments are good to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of consignments received from 60,000 to 15,000 have fallen on the international post in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for data supply that are necessary to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, it is on the international post 30,000 consignments we need to process.
If people were to fill out all the data that were needed and to fill them in time, we would be here in about half, says the spokesman of the Czech Post Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation Solutions
See the subtitle, how would you suggest a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation, and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think it should be worth doing to slow this growth or compensate?
Do we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this your way?
What do you think will happen to what is inevitable with where it goes?
Prices grow faster than salaries, I think it's inevitable that people will not afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who's an employee)?
I've been added to 2% in gross this year, which is a laugh, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business I run at work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why provenly convictions are sent to prison for only six months?
This head just doesn't bother me how the court can only send such an animal for six months behind bars just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 Months are nothing compared to his/her victim having trauma for several years, negatively affects her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And not to mention that the victim of rape never needs to recover from it again.
Doesn't this help even the potential future statement of victim rape?
A man from the tomb burned his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the tomb unwantedly helped officers to secure his whole - wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat to whom a warrant for arrest was issued.
He called them to her himself.
Well, he was on it with an alley.
First, he spoke to the survivor and invented a story that he was robbed.
After the call on the emergency line, the officers arrived at the place and were not enough to wonder when the alleged "draded" told them that he invented everything to make the officers come to the place.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers about how he's supposed to make a announcement on the Czech Police.
When we checked the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a national search, and there's a warrant for arrest.
The case therefore deals with the CPR.
Honest question for people here, do you think our country is Slovak?
I personally believe that we are no longer ethnic or culturally spoken, but I would be interested in your opinion.
In other words, I agree with mem, of course, the shame that Churchill failed to provide the release of the U.S. Prague :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slovak language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually believe in something without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree here with Pascale, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should you choose?
I would say that in all, there is a likelihood that there is at least one god in one of these thousands of religions who will be a miserablely punished by you if you believe in another god.
But even in the dessert, there is no god but Jahve.
Wouldn't it be more rational in this case to stay in faith in any god than to risk having to choose the wrong choice of thousands of gods, and the real god I just didn't hit will send me to hell or some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar to me.
X months of training (in various specialists, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you're doing well, you can get a professional offer.
All ACR's ingredients would be good for this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defence University.
We can talk this way: The cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly mitigated, the companies are hunting in schools, and there is some kind of curlage when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when you grow up, but this process takes place all the time, each of us learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar crossings should also work between civil and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or a Mongolian raider will never be intruding here again.
I think it's funny how you think NATO's something in the stone, we have allies, and they're going to stop us if there's trouble.
Well, good luck with the master.
Just one election in the United States that shorten their budget and the whole NATO goes to the cunt.
Anglani will replace us with Russian money, the Germans will replace us with Russian gas, and the Poles have once shown themselves to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has been working for a long time as a guarantee of self-resistance is armed army and the population that can control the military technique of his time.
And today, he can pilot remotely controlled resources every teenager, so what it wouldn't do.
We don't need border fortification, that's a fart today, but a teenager behind the remote-controlled knives will be able to deal with.
How not to drown in box tsunami
You're gonna unpack gifts under a Christmas tree, and then you're at home inflamed with boxes and fills?
This “waste” reuses the e-shops with which the packaging is missing.
Therefore, there was a map of shops that your used boxes would welcome.
And it's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to last repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as one-time waste.
Anyone can, in agreement, bring into the involved trade (map of the project KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150) carton boxes, plastic or paper filling.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging that is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton healed by 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally thoughtful customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One of these shops is TIERRA VERDE, eco drug manufacturer and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and the filling material are called to us in Popůvek near Brno by individuals who are assembled at home, but also companies with which we have arranged regular carriages of postponed cartons.
We'll use everything in packing a package from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature by the next generation, says Petra Lopusníková of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling sites on the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to remove the waste from the house, where to dispose of the past drugs, tyres, powered electro, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
So all garbage can end in the right place, plus reused things will find their second home.
A total map of the project contains over 100,000 such locations.
“Substorms, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places to help find use for things that would otherwise have become waste,” Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Cleaning the Czech Republic.
I think it's rather bad that technology is so simple and stupid these days that kids who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
The problem (mainly in the English articles) recently appeared that students of universities do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple app for photos or actually mobile phones in general, they simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and all flies into one screen in the application.
They can use a technique since childhood, but don't let them learn anything.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – starting in January – and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke over an hour during which the Presidency's logo revealed, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they can't reach in six months.
French politicians like it, but they like it, and they like the voters.
Macron's supporters of the crossing between the right and the left agree to little, but in Europe, yes.
And in France, there will be a new election in April to the head of the state.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
Among other things, the French leader pointed out that the historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for historians like this.
A number of commentators immediately contributed with criticism that Macron was a pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In fact, they're trying to defend history.
The national right-wing candidate for the French President Éric Zemmour is currently circumcising France with the fact that the Vicha regime, which in the second World War, collaborated with Hitler, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea on one book history writing seriously and don't look at things in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn to lose history as a story we versus them and never as a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs, find out who defeated the battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened kantor, they won't know what a wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Myss" didn't win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenice in 1995, also received awards for the director and for the best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovar festival, he was held at the first quest of the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for the Father's movie.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was about like "being a flu/breasted" I had a few days of diarrhoea and I didn't like to smoke...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have diarrhoea at the flu.
(Only personal experience, I'm not saying that's what everyone has)

Trains start driving according to the new schedule, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, they start driving trains according to the new schedule.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on certain lines, for example between the Axis above the Lab and the Cologne, where the Czech roads are starting to drive RegioJet.
For most lines, the departure time will only be adjusted, if appropriate slightly as well as their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Sell tickets started the carriers during the autumn.
The Czech routes plan to operate daily in the new schedule on average 6783 passenger transport connections, from which it will be daily on average of 478 remote trains.
Trains run around 118 million miles during the new schedule.
Railways next to national connections under the new schedule will also be driven to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new schedule, will set up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains to ride on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be carried out by the carrier in North Moravia or Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the driving prices from next year by 3.2 percent on average.
Railways take account of inflation into their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's schedule is the entry to the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Malník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech tracks after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
On the line, RegioJet will be broadcasting a total of 16 connections every day, eight in every direction.
Other changes are related to remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkova Brod Stations, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained his 16 connections, two return connections in Slovakia, as well as weekend connections to Krakow.
According to the spokesperson, Emil Sedlořík, the carrier has also tried to maintain the time of his remote trains despite the planned discharge work as much as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also replace in some regional lines.
Changes are expected, for example, for example, for the Czech Republic, where on the line from Mladé Boleslav přes Český Líp to Rumburk will be the place of the Czech roads to ride the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use the single railways for the second year.
As with the Czech Roads, their price increases by inflation 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the look on the other side?
We all hear how much they had to fight for their rights as oppressed and had to work, they died.
I've never heard lessons from a slave party's point of view or from that time, no one's defending this, just condemning it.
No one tells you in school that black men often sold themselves into slavery black and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one can teach you at school that colonisers often bought land from the Indians, they're gonna tell you how brutally we, Europeans, were murdered, killing each other long ago.
I also spent a while in the US, right in schools, in the norther schools and in the south.
I haven't encountered anyone deliberately confusing facts, but I've heard earlier that this is happening, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny that (the need in Japan is quite a tabooo from WW2.)
My point was that history is not black and white, and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what she is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the stuff from the past.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're already in those Southern states, yes, confederate flag and famous slaves are quite popular there, on the other hand, they've had some good successes and came to me absurdly reject them.
Besides, the North wasn't much better than you're idealizing him these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them on the South were slaves, and they had a lot of trouble.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they deliberately leave some facts, lie and manipulate, and perhaps our view of them is not there (the YT was also a video of TV where someone who started talking about our legionists and 1968).
What I found in the U.S. school was ridiculous was the rise of marxism and idealization of communism, something that never experienced their land.
Overall, I thought it was awful at some universities, those students were quite traditional, and the schools were in the same amount of support.
And if I imagine these people will be a lot older once, I'm a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because among young people there is, and even in government elite.
I feel like feminism's been getting what he had, and it's not about the same, he's been traividized.
At the moment, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalisation, even on the other side, where it often leads to opposition in quite reasonable things.
Besides, the more radical someone is, the more it is to hear him.
Anyway, at the end, I didn't see anyone judged me for colonialism or slavery either.
More like I met the wrong geography, but it was bipartite :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's totally unprecedented.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality unnecessary from a personal identity point of view.
If something about people involves me with interests, world views and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has a preaching more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some coronavir coconut that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, the Church of Czechoslovak is here.
Officially, they're Protestants, but they're actually born of Catholic modernity, and they're really catolating without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to goose services because they're very theologically similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on the Botanic street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michal on the Dominican square belongs to the Dominican Square, and even there every Sunday at 3:00, they make masses in Latin, like it was done before Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in Czech Republic, the scouts took him from Austria
Břeclav – The plaminek in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts have taken him for the pandemic of the coronavir, but even this time they did not go to Vienna, took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav.
He was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem's light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the section every year, I look forward to it.
It's an honor for me to have been chosen, told to the journalists the scout of the Amalia Alarm.
While the transfer took place last year at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now on the Reintal-Břeclav crossing at the parking lot.
Usually, scouts ride him by train to Vienna.
There's nothing to change at the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts have traveled traditionally by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesed bishop of Vojtěch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, 18 December, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent light distribution, who will travel by selected speeders and by personal trains.
From them, the light will take over in the local scout stations or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flames of the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, the scouts must comply with the valid measures against the spread of the coronavir.
It works like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of the local events to, of course, carry the sleeves, try to follow their disparities, they were at least, not singing colleagues, just acting as safely as possible, described by the spokesmen's actions of the Bethlehem light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels by Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread with the flame of the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
Bethlehem’s light is for the believer’s symbol of hope, the light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, a flame is also a symbol of inevitability and human mutuality.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for the flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that the granting of the so-called cancer of the economy, but I don't think the grant as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education properly uses the money, but I don't understand why the money is being paid to agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned, the unnecessary product is produced, and it distorts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a fabric myself where there are millions of "xy financed/co-financed by xy project" in the hallways, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the company's support that gives the job x people, this is the mitigation of developments when this company sticks and collects contracts/employees to companies that could grow after her disappearance and be more productive
Total consent, it's terrible.
Sometimes the person who was born in the Internet will also catch a trick or a trap - especially advertisements.
I don't think Internet ads are moving with me, but then I'm gonna catch that they've influenced me - it's just so erratic that you're not always going to get away with it.
For this reason, I support radical votes in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on programming (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, in the way of classics - I would have forbidden the Internet.
I feel like this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not gonna believe something that most believes and makes sense, I'm not sheep, but I'd rather believe something less likely doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion about which I'm going to say it's a critical thinking."
2. "I'm not gonna believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions fell through the Christmas movie trend, the premiere of them have two hundred of them this year.
Los Angeles – Kina, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English speaking countries have fallen through the trend of Christmas films and their audiences in the premiere this year will present a record of over two hundred.
The IMDb Film Database operator counted it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years scores and increases considerably the rating, therefore these images are becoming more and more.
Four times more Christmas movies were filmed this year than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only the images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its name, so the holiday films will actually be much more.
Movies that people traditionally connect to Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, they are associated with this period especially fairy tales, they are globally popular as well as pictures Home, Love heavenly or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas pictures, however, started until in 2009, when a special film series came the American Hallmark cable station, reminded the BBC server.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Recalation to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to load its viewers for Christmas on October 22, and will present 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime's competition station has 35 new Christmas theme films this year and contributes to the total sum to the popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
"In this magical period of story it doesn't matter again, it's important that there's a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that snowes," said Brandon Gray, the author of the book of Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home for Christmas movies).
“For viewers it is a form of leakage and a way to feel a bit calm for at least two hours in the middle of all this holiday madness and madness of the world in which we live in the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then some half an hour before the end of a misunderstanding, which, of course, will seem to solve, and these two will kiss.
That's how it's all over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, add Gray.
Mazepine had a positive text on covid-19, not hit the final F1 race.
The Great Price Abu Kills in formula 1 only hits 19 riders.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and won't hit the last season race.
Haas stands to send only one formula on the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th race that he went into his qualifications.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will ultimately not hit the Great Prize of Abu Zabít.
He was positively tested for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars appear on the launch rope, from the last line will go to the Mazepin team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Versappen, who in the direct battle will be arrested for the title with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepine is relatively correct according to the Haas stable and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, while security will be the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," said its representatives for formula1.com.
He can't even send a replacement rider to the Haas race.
The relevant alternate would have to attend qualifications or driving in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 does not face the first racer.
At the start of the ending seasons he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were positively tested by Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton.
They'll arrest you for this, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sweater is impressed!
He's kind of like a portable jewelry and a creator put six months of work in it and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, never had much to carry sweaters in our house,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in six months.
The silk bought in Italy, a 24-carate gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals added to Swarowski.

And there's another hook.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as fast as possible," admits Lebanon.
If he succeeds, he will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, stood “just” 720,000 crowns.

The Hygiene's checking out another case of Adam's baby.
“We have reported additional suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the ZS Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases appeared in the country week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Pharmacovigilance Reference Laboratory for the influenza and the flu viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one workplace of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old students from ZS Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adam.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four unmarkable courses.
No one suspected Omicron was traveling abroad.
None of these were traveling abroad or any of their families, nor had any contact with anyone who stayed abroad.

California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas on the abortion ban.
Governor Californie Gavin Newsom, on Saturday, announced a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most human state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of the cardiac artery.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who makes or sells firearms and firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to the fifth opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in force, even though it was against almost 50 years of preceding verdict, which set the right to abort the platform throughout the United States by approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now decided on the constitution of the whole law, but on a technical question that is based on the innovative design of the measures.
The enforcement of the ban has been made public in this case, thereby preventing the Texas Republicans from attacking him in the ordinary course of court.
"I am an outraged by yesterday's (first) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas's maneuver to protect its law," said the California Governor.
"If the states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this authority to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He said that in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, he entrusted his subsidiary to work on measures that would entitle the public representative to enforce the ban on attack rifles and the so-called ghost weapons.
This is the case of submersible weapons produced that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulation.
Newsom wants to have the right of “private citizens” to require at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and the judicial expenses from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell attack rifles, components to "guns of spirits" or sets for their production.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, to create a threat to private lawsuits, then we should do so," said the California Governor.
The AP notes that for decades California has prohibited the production and sale of certain weapons of military style, but in June, the federal judge here has blocked the ban as counter-constitutional.
If the State actually renewed the ban with the use of the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in disagreeable opinion of the fifth majority verdict, would be confirmed before the extension of the legal mechanism to other American States.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant complete immunity to the court review and allowed abortion clinics to continue the lawsuits on the selected actors of the U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its public test phase, where it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like, and there are also improvements in the vaccine itself, based on results.
Israele, for example, already in a large rolling study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients have a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has already been mentioned in the long-term effect.
Just like any other vaccination will have its vaccination schedule in time, just so far it's too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should come into the market for a short time, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the specification of the manufacturer, promises up to 10 times more efficiency.
The amount of the product can be kept.

Poland threatened to halt payments in the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it had taken advantage of the new powers and, in view of the legal state dispute, it would stop the payment of the money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan on the extraction of EUR 36 billion from the EU Fund for the recovery of the economies affected by the pandemics of Covid-19.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism to take the EU's subsidies to countries that violate the rule of law.
"Polish should answer this extortion by the EU veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small party Solidar Poland, without its votes, the current government would lose the close majority in Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," said Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will ask Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU unlawfully rejects the funds from the common budget we also contribute to, added the Polish Minister.
Its side in accessing the EU takes more radical positions than the ruler party of law and justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes which Polish justice has passed for Ziobrova’s action threaten its independence and undermine it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, the Brussels builds “unpossible conditions because its goal is not a rule, but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces the “political dictate carried out by blackmailing and trying to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles” also said Ziobro.
He pointed out that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on the partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never come to such concessions as Brussels, resulting in which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
"We will never agree to have Poland a colony status," said.
But confessing to it... in Lidlu, there's one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves, I resigned and asked.
They had him, it's true, in the narrow sector, they were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the freelactose zone...
If there's an evacuation, I can't smell any more market, action unactions, gold store on the square, maybe they don't have a choice, but they usually have everything I need, and they have a order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidlu to take a vacation.
And I don't care.
I've been watching two years, when I've been reading with data like fertilizers, most vaccination opposers are just a little more off the bowl than most vaccines.
Racional discussion is taking place at a professional level, but only extreme views are being taken into public space.
Always from the wall to the wall.
Binary thoughts: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Forbid it all, let it all go.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparison of apples with pears.
This state is like this, and we have it like this.
But the methodology for collecting data is different in those two states.
Ugh, so I've relieved myself.

I was punished by a cook in my childhood.
It was never because of the stamps, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (I read instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a wound (sometimes even after another "snap" cook just brought up and laid down to see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few shots on my ass (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child responds far more than to the words.
I think it's important to me that part with a warning because it gives the child his own choice whether he doesn't listen and gets, or he'll get better, and the punishment won't be.
In the end, all I had to do was warn me to start listening.
System Defence
When a significant Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered in 1999 a journalistic question, what the Czech Constitution meant for him – whether the sacred leaf, which he swears on, and which she was deprived of at school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that could be altered if necessary, he definitely added to the first concept.
Once in the constitution, we agreed on democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who as a state and its citizens we are, and with changes, to save them better.
And imagine: some nations even love their rules.
As Czechs like to have dumplings with pork and zebra, he then voiced the question Vojtěch Cepl.
However, recently, more often there is a view among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs change.
Years are tested by situations that her creators (which belonged to Vojtěch Cepl) could not foresee, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to handling most of the crises that society meet across history.
The constitution is, among other things, a rule of rule of rule consisting of individual rules that set the policy of the game mantinela.
We are afraid that the power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind the policy.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno fighting for the life of a few months baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder to the children, there are also severe cases that the hospitals have been dealing with most recently.
"We know that children are threatened and affected by less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Prime Minister Kliniky of Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty of Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The process is much easier, easier, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are severely ill with coronavir, which we see especially in the last period," said Dominic.
According to the doctor, dozens of children need mild supportive care.
It's the clinic of infectious children's diseases.
Really, very severely ill children with coronavir are only recently on the ARU.
Children with post-covide syndrome were on the medical department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means with lung burning which requires a resuscitation bed," said and added that this disease affects adults as well as adolescents, as well as several months' babies.
In hospitals, children in difficulty occur because of coronavir.
“ Currently, there is a child of several months and adolescent age with us,” said the prime minister.
However, it is pleased that at the FN Brno Children’s Hospital there has not yet been any children’s deaths on the coronavirus.
According to the available data, the death of six children aged between 0 and 14 in the Czech Republic was 6 December.
According to Dominic, there is an integral part of the psychological cooperation in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavir department.
At the same time, it also points out that as in adults, as well as in children, vaccination reduces the course of disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
"This is why we recommend a dose of vaccination in children," said the doctor.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk after marked roads.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They are shown on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally, in national parquets outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb through the fence into the field).
Skiing/training a bike in the woods outside the marked road must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but, of course, it does not look at that much outside the national park).
How do the conductor practice?
The music's in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughing.
He's decorated with a liberal opera and originally played on the woods corner.
As a singer, he can sing virtually all the repertoire and as conductor works not only in the Liberian Theatre F. Saldy, but also in Pilsen, at the Theatre of Joseph Kajetan Tyl.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, with a film Philharmonic or with a subkrconosian symphonic orchestra.
China builds the impression of the disease managed and that the authoritarian regime faces a crisis better
Sinolog Jirouš: China builds the impression of the affected disease and that the authoritarian regime faces a crisis better.
China has gone into medical and political offensives.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected his criticism for not stopping the disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports the zero-infected increases.
Countries including Czech competition for Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors often help to fight coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do I feel about Beijing?
Is this a friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of mine and he says, "Hey, you don't want a elephant?
I've got it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she salvates the weed, the car's washing, the kids play with him.
Well, it's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell the elephant.
Friend: All right, let's hit it, that's gonna be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought it complains, you dude who sold it for an elephant??
The trawler's solstished, the giant shit everywhere, the car's sitting down, the kids fight him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
He who's selling says, "Now you're talking about the elephants, that's not how you're going to sell the elephants...
The world's events are superpowered.
Although the equality of the sovereign states is valid, they are precisely enormous to determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a great deal if it works on its integration.
It is currently working at economic and political level (in selected questions), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is headed towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of a century, the moods will be different and it will succeed.
I thought of it, too, and it's pretty possible.
I'm not an expert in češtinu, so maybe I'm a little bit of a word.
I'm just getting out of the fact that elipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment on the Spanish oranges and mandarins, where it is clear that these are both from Spain, while in "Spain fruits and mandarins" it is not clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I assume that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that the American complexes are only being operated.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in this broad concept and it is not necessary to further specify it in the US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying:
Whatever it is, it's an unreasonable requirement.
In Tokyo, an earthquake was recorded with a force of five degrees.
The Japanese metropolies of Tokyo and the surrounding areas in Sunday affected the earthquake of the force of 5.0 degrees.

There was no warning from the dumplings, informed the Reuters agency.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured ape of Cosmina Milly
The frightening footage show the moment that a frightening monkey crawled in the toilet bowl before her insensitive owner flushed and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now forbidden her animal breeding, informed The Sun's journal.
Experts to rehabilitate monkeys who care about Milly after her abuse said they've never seen such a terrified spaceman before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitation with the Monkey World staff in Dorset, and now she is happy to play again with another saved monkey named Moon.
Four-fold mother confessed to two charges due to the unnecessary suffering of a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrate Court, she was penalized a 12-week day sentence with a conditional deference for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on animal breeding and must pay over 12,000 crowns of court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She cried and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her shout.
Monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she's settled and satisfied with her male, she can still panic in her view of new people.
Psychic scars from abuse will be accompanied forever, delivering Sawyer.
Milly's worms came out after the Gwent police discovered the scary footage of her phone in her wife's apartment for the charge of drugs.
You can hear Milly broadcast on the footage.
The next video is to hear Holland's ape offer cocaine and say, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to holding cocaine with the intention to sell it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (about 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was then imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a parole of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from the right three times by yourself when you go over the 20th century bravely?
Like you're gonna take the same stuff in the sixth grade?
And this whole thing kills the idea of bibling, when no one, the honor of exceptions, doesn't care if you know or understand.
Just write a test to one, and then no one cares.
Go on and on the street ask randomly people if you can handle the character of the roots of the quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority won't even squeeze and they'll tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning for?
I'm a big fan of general overview, and the fact is that people don't want and don't have the need.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly learning for a lot of people who need that thing.
But, like, the note that you really don't need all of this to stand at the machine, I was thinking completely seriously... because you just don't need it.
Besides, we're slowly getting to the point of not knowing it's a stamp of punk.
But the price that our communist past and educators will become barbarians will simply be high for us with these machines.
If, for example, journalists could count, there's probably never been enough to reach these dimensions here.
Wedding at first sight: War Kadri and Andrey continue!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave now," Andrea replied to the instagram in Stories on all the questions of curious fans, which disappointed her in Kadrim so disappointed that she decided to end all contacts and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, it's been shaking from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And, as you can see, their relationship not only ended up with love, but rather grew in mutual disrespect to hatred.
He was angry with the turn of Kadri in response to Andrea's lies, gambler and debt.
Kadri's thoughtful sincerity now, the ex-wife didn't even like his younger sister Linda.
That's what my brother decided to stand publicly.
Usually, I'm not speaking to such things at all, and in the family, we've never said too much extra things.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to hurt publicly and spill the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give me that!
I'm sorry that I have to do this this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was a young age.
I'm more sorry if I have to read this untrue information that's probably out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I, our loved ones and our family, to be acquainted with Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what's written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above everything, and we know the fact, and we know how it really was, she added it indefinitely.
The drunk thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao started his robbery expedition at the parking lot in the residential neighborhood where he tried to infiltrate several cars.
According to the information available, he finally cut off in less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he thought nothing better than climbing into the 5th floor and entering the apartment with an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
On the footage from one of the security cameras is then caught leaving the streets away from the crime scene and eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found out that the bananas weren't where they were, and called the police.
And then Cchaa was detained.
A man confessed that he drank alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is in the investigation so far.
The monkey climbed up the facade to the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think that's all people say to you, you know.
You're just playing a fool to have a fight with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like a lot of church constructions from aesthetic perspective (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I don't care how much the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money she recorded, repressed science, etc.
Not to mention all wars that caused, e.g. the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe yourself in a spaghetti monster, but stand and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The concrete impact has survived.
The unbelievable fall survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, with the paramedics of the Regional Healthcare Service.
Workers of the Regional Operation Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight of an emergency call with initial information on the fall of a man from height.
Two ZZS crews went out immediately - medical and medical.
After arrival at the medical site, the seventeen-year-old man was supposed to fall out of the window from around 12 meters and reach the head on concrete!
Coal caught in Vitkovice.
But not the way it should be, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The doctor instructed his respiratory path, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after further measures in the context of pre-necessary emergency care, the sanitary vehicle carried it into further care of the Ostrava traumatological center, informed the spokesman of the ZZS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
More fears than the coronavir I have from unsatisfactory public responses and the authorities

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala party full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things were done.
Outsider Julianna Peň could defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found the slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light vase, demonstrated great scratch against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The winner also recorded Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt technical KO at the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
That brought a woman's fight of bantam weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pene.
The American joined the battle as a thoughtful “past,” Nunes didn't lose for seven years and wiped her teeth on another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was held in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way after winning a lot actively, and the opponent even gave her a push kick that she sent her to the ground.
However, the Penna did not allow any other mistakes and failed to attack with the lever on her hand.
The second round was rising and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals participated in a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
She also got Nunes on the ground where she started choking.
She must have given up her effort and knocked down the attack.
That's how Americans prepared a huge shock to all when she became a new champion.
The battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier was the top of the galave.
At first, although Poirier was better, the card began to turn around gradually.
In the other, he tried to be more active in Oliveira, who tried to catch the lever on his hand.
Although this was too bad for him, then he created a great pressure, he got a rival on his back and fell down with a number of wounds.
That's what won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear of the naked choke, whom Poirier had to resist for a while, but then he had to squeeze away.
In fact, the Brazilian defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley's suverén triumph, who's already on Rauliana Paiva's hard back in the first round.
He then hit him with a number of precisely degree hits and recorded a fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first sight, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the essential names in Czech only express one grammatical family, and therefore there is no problem determining whether it is a male, female or medium-sized family.
Then there is also a relatively numerous group of essential names for which the family is not fixed.
Such essential names vary between two families.
In the leaning, they are two ends, and in some cases they remain incredibly inclined form.
For example, the words “light” or “crying” are male and female, in which they tend to go according to the model “government”, in the second according to the model “song”.
For other groups of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of a single number, such as ‘both/both’, ‘cooked/cooked’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are conspicuous, they are equally meaningful and therefore are free to replace.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as the “currence” in Bohemia and “kurek” in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is insignificant, similarly the other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: “couples” and “couples”, “cobs” and “cobs” etc.
Some of the words that had penetrated the Czech language were originally inclined, but they gradually take over Czech ends.
A typical example is the term “image” which is a male and female family, or the word “buffet”, which remained inclined in the middle of the family, in male but has the end according to the model “garden”.
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation on the Greek borders?
There is a tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to get further to Europe.
Thousands of people began to issue to the southern borders of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, and the Czech government will also have humanitarian assistance.
What, in fact, motivates refugees to the insecure path?
And what's the situation right in place?
Three months we haven't seen blue sky and choked, described by a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the lonely people deal with distress?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to avoid the drastic effects, as critics say?
And what will the country in connection with climate change have to prepare for the future?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and very rare.
That's why everyone is always written everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to figure out how sexual violence looks in our company and how awfully widespread it is, so they're trying to order it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped, and I've seen how they often treat people around them or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
Trend, the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But it keeps too many people to keep it to himself.
Yes, there are some who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a great part of the accusations is made" and that it's "trand" you only help sexually violent people.
The Czechs flood the decorated houses, families don't have money to complete
The prices of construction material have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people have gotten into a quirky situation for this.
It does not have the means to complete distributed family homes and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of material, the price of construction works is increasing.
That's why people don't have enough money to complete their family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
In a better case, people move to dissolved and unrailed homes.
In the worst case, uninhabitable houses are distributable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and to pay rent," says the economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two to three family houses in a year, and we'll get 50 percent.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult for us to keep things contractive, even though the material healed.
So we're doing no earnings," said the owner of Zdeněk Slivoň's construction company.
A lot of people will only have financial problems.
If they're counting on building a house of $5 million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
The copper, iron, as well as installation and topenary equipment was most submerged from the material.
However, construction companies are also fighting the lack of labour.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction fields and foreign workers' influx hamper pandemics.
Only the situation regarding the issue of construction permits is more favourable at this point.
“State authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” said Křeček.
We're good and we're gonna get better.
Real visions, however, are missing, says commentator ČRO – myjRozhlas
The entry into the new year, except for classical celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by speeches of politicians.
This year, they spoke to the nation, apart from the Prime Minister and President ANO Andrei Babiš and the Christmas message of President Milosh Zeman and the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Parliament.
What do we know?
I feel like a great diploma right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow a bachelor, I always do it all year round, and then I write a written part in a week to two.
The D.A.s are completely calm with us, if you're not a total mac, and something left in his head, then the commission won't have to suffocate him on the theory.
I may have learned a week at the station, and when I was at the end, the committee has always tried to lead me to some logical disruption that just got me right, and I had it right.
Otherwise, for these projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it many times, really beneficial, a lot of lessons) and then they'll just learn the project and they're taken care of.
I think it's cool when at the end of the course, the test is to show up knowledge gained within the project, not just a defense.
All right, but don't absorb e-mails and phones and send no packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick as them.
Those people in the embassy have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they'd have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar sculpture of Putin next to Pú's statue.
You might want to give it to Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks under his feet to artists.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reaches will be reduced to a complete minimum.
In addition, it still changes what function is more important if a doll, comment or deposit.
I've been so fucked up lately, so maybe I'm gonna have to get down to the tictoc, where a lot of artists from my business have a success, and they're not almost letting it happen.
Eventually, I might also like to see something of the user warmer that doesn't suck out of artists of all creativity and energy
Declaration of the Parties working on Donbase
The union – yes, broken – no, expresses their opinion on the image of the opposers to break the SSSR.
Thirty years since the unlawful break of the SSSR.
On December 8, 1991, there was the largest geopolitical disaster in human history.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum on 17 March 1991, with an open advancing position of Michail S. Gorbačov, secretly, regardless of the people, signed the agreement that “SSSR as an entity of international law and as geopolitical reality ceases to exist”.
With one cut of the pens, the “repealed” of a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
The SSSR dismantled dozens of millions of ethnics of Russian citizens abroad.
From the beginning of the 1990s, Russia's population decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even regardless of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet Republics, we have lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people, who destroyed what was built in the past 70 years, betrayed a socialist camp (a cost of millions of lives in the second World War and the Great patriotic war).
Scientically, they have deindustrialized, stopped agriculture, removed the world's greatest power of 14 republics, which have previously been economically linked to the only mechanism.
If we want to look deeper, then we see the loss of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, the interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechen, all the conflicts in the post-soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakdown of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical liquidation, the surrender of the first socialist camp, and the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politology as "vakuum of strength".
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world has been shaken up today mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s of the last century.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with the fact that I'll put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, it'll be a discount chain on Tuesdays for CZK 99/ kg - describe to me the mechanism that will change the mass by changing its price will become the burden for my life system?
Or do I wait until Thursday, and that meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption discounted to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought about 120 CZK ice and left it 3 days in my fridge?
I'll answer myself - I'm nothing.
These bullshit about the fact that when something's cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, corrupt or invalid, they're awfully retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now I went to Brno recently to headas and the ladies were giving out some brochure, I always take things like that to help the brigade, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of selian sense and conservative view of the functioning of the world, but nothing about the god, I was confused, but I thought it was some kind of agitation.
After reading, I found who was spending it and finally came out of it scientology.
Well, like it was a good piece of shit, full of completely unnecessary pilgrimages, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
A waste of paper, that's not what the forests would have to do.
I've seen something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmailing you make this person dignified because you like him without you knowing how much the situation is in the d*del.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk outside.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried, and she asked me not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
About a year, it was a great relationship, but then another six months passed, and it started shaking on her thumb.
Then I ended the relationship with that I told her I was breaking up and lying to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some amok again.
A man like you sucks out feelings, emotions and joy overall.
You'd better keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are rabidly robbed by buying clouds of tests and chasing positive ones who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we're achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random numbers generator have fallen five days in domestic prison.
In the west, they stopped with the scarf and admitted it's not worth dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new, and he has to steal something else and drive ego by inventing a buzz.
Looks like an old scumbag is coming back.
After a few years of repression and repression of this unfair business, the MLM recruiting returns to the prosecution.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (it was 20 years old, first-year-old in the O.R.), initial promises about product training and business skills quickly turned into "that doesn't have to interest you, especially get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offered, since I wanted to help people, but training was more than to scare and temptate people.
When the first earned money came, a man quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to pick up several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so that humans felt like an underlooking pot salesman.
But what I can say, experience was valuable, you learned that you shouldn't jump right on every tip and look at the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People are successful in this business, and even people will benefit, but they will certainly not brag about expensive consumables or "permanent" accounts.
In a corporation where I've been doing so many things I've never seen.
The HR is calm, the managers are looking for their managers, and they don't put a lot in our noses.
The regular evaluation is somehow, in the form of which this is going to be quite possible in us (set some targets for the next year, we'll see what has come up and what's not) - it's more of a self-evaluation than that you would be evaluated by some numbers, and similarly.
Corporate actions are also optional.
But we are also a bit of a escape within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're almost the startup that squatts in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't bother us that way until the results are done.
The Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
Nearly ten days, the British police have been searching for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which has disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the demission Jakub Kulhánek on social networks that the woman from Uherskohradišt found a dead woman.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our D.A. in London that she found the body of the missing Czech citizens.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we're not going to share more information on the case.
My condolences, he said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman last saw the bus on November 28th, on the way out of work, and before the meeting, she was supposed to pick up the money from the ATM.
Her disappearance has been reported by colleagues from work five days later.
Then the London police started searching for it, Interpol put it in the missing world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
A few days ago, the police arrested one man in this context.
What he was supposed to play in the case, and what she suspected of, but she didn't publish it.
At the end of the year, four municipalities gave themselves a new representative.
On Saturday, 11 December Komňa, Uherskohradišť, Lužice, Mostecko, Nová Ves, Liberec, and Rovná, in Pelhřimov, were elected to new representatives.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law of the number or the elected representative has fallen apart.

The 28 deputy posts were 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years.
Processing the results of Saturday elections makes us symbolically close to a relatively challenging year, but a successful year.
The new or repeated elections to the general representations were made in it and, above all, the very watched elections to the House of Parliament.
We usually had to work in more challenging epidemic conditions, which gave more demands for equipment and personal security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 pm.
The results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday and will be published in the Law Collection after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
To deal with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease lasted to me at the very beginning, but it went without bigger troubles.
Coping with how stupid a large part of the population is coming up on all its layers, I have a problem now.
I am most excited about vaccination ( tomorrow!) because he will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people are not bullshit.
He would've been deprived of the president's office and the ability to rebuild it.
The chance that this is really going to happen is how the others here mention a very small one.
Besides, I'm not sure if the file firing could be considered treason at all.
Velezrada is such an act that the President of the Republic will jeopardise sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic nature of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How pandemics influenced intimate life: Growing people up to 35 years of age who are free of sex all year
More young adults in the US live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously founded people, reports the web of DailyMail journal.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021 the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sexual life was lifted from eight to 21 percent.
The woman between 18 and 35 years, which said that the last year had no sexual intercourse, is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, showed the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One may be the economic impact of the pandemic of coronavir and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But it could also contribute the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less and less priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has been growing rapidly," said the researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
For people in marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, only 5% in 2021 said they were unsexed in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious creation also contributes to the abolition of sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married younger than 35 years is still dropping.
Young people share their views on pre-marriage sex, about 30% thinks it's wrong, while around 70% thinks he's okay.
“It is true that there are minorities among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior moves this trend,” Stone says about these 30 percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marriage are the reason for religious creation.
Since 2008, free people under 35 years of age who participated in religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the “men of the believers” the trend was raised from 10 to 20%,” said Stone.
Other factors, such as less social interactions, and mainly social alcohol drinks during pandemic times, contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason could be the extension of digital media that apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing."
This trend was mainly held for lockdown at the time of the pandemic of the coronavir.
The entire order of vaccination against covid is whether the company should force a part of the population to be treated as being unwanted, but which can save their lives.
It is a relatively heavy question that I personally care about the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is whether if we don't tell them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly not get a vaccination for the death of an 80-year-old person who actually didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he listened to a disinformation, and, as a result, he didn't give a vaccination and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we're going to be the death of a hard-ass vaccination vaccination opposer, who's talking about a bully and totalitarian state by the side of the SPD and the CSC.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will really be able to do so themselves.
Czech without snow.
How will a mild winter sign on the fight with dry?
This year's winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snow benefits in the last time.
Ski area operators will not go without a technical snow, the weather will also complicate the preparation of the Jizera 50 runners.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean to fight dry in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not about a puppet.
Once in high school, the teacher led us all over the city to the yard so we could take a ride on boats on the river.
On the way there, we went once in a pretty wide street, and we probably don't see anyone in the midst - the sects of Hare Krishna.
Of course, they've fallen on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but one friend and I talked to.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
All of us, including a teacher, were laughing all the way up to the yard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not so much going on, but the system's already crashing, says Orozovich
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," said Morawiecki at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Thecholz pointed out that Europe had to show together that it would not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, called on by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at Ukrainian borders, is appropriate to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the "normand group", which associate France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor informed about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukaszenko artificially caused a migratory crisis and uses people as live targets and guns, because we record hundreds of attempts of (legal) crossing the borders every night.
With the Chancellor, he was dealing with other sanctions so that Lukashenk's regime and his patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were decided to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA, he made sure that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenk's regime with the drivers.
The drunken Polish shoemaker caused an accident, trying to cover it up.
The car returned to the scene after a while, but the car was driving another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving up the ride and taking off the accident, she went out with the truth, said TVN24 station.
She admitted that another nun came into the vehicle who asked for help.
Policemen then came to get Sister Celestin.
She was undergone a breath test, and after they found out she had two per mile of her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her he'd testify to her actions in court.
Hugo dog does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovich didn't watch his film.
The Czech creators of family comedies have seen in American stories about dogs of lovers.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film craftsman.
After the F. Brabce Gump film - the dog that taught people to live is now about the spectacular emotions in the cinema passing another image Here we are guarding.
The co-author of scenarios and directors in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. is free to follow his previous film Here I am watching from 2012.
The Hugo spokesman returns to the scene and some known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the scumbag pension that ends, and so they start to invite a doggy, Juli's father with a partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director with his partner Beatriz Šajmovič (which is also the film producer) dealt with the talk procedures already in the previous dog image, but there were at least children and dogs.
This time, she wrote a creative pair even weaker scenario that creates a blend of astonishment and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, though a scientist, is subject to the desire for a child of dark delusions and if the proper "constellation" comes, he copulates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just determine – on the cap of a car or church tower (i.e. during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), a colonel Mojmír, despite the summer training, will shoot his own daughter (Julii), which falls into a coma that is taken away from the hospital, so that in the heart of the schummer's lonely can play a charming process of healing the dog.
Nothing against purity treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer wonders what the contents of the pelmel filled with incredibly situations and figures were needed for this message.
Two thieves from staff, doggies competition, scumbag sharlatan, cops coming to the show looking for "drogs" and discussing herbs about fertile force of bone flour – and which, of course, the baked family in the pension will drink.
When the hero of a heavy coma comes up and he sits onondulated and dressed with a cigarette at the family table and demands fathers of whiskey and whiskey as a vegetarian cured, he can't be laughed.
On top of the spectacle, the creators will explain that “this sometimes happens after coma.”
The Šajmovič team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of the work with the text, the ability to build the nasal situation, the feeling of character and point and direction.
The acting performances are unbalanced, cut helpless and overall impressions attached.
However Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boud is trying to stop her party, they have nothing to play.
The only reason for the film is that the poetic footage of the smuggling nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomek and the pair of riders.
It is not enough to redeem a few characters, a chatter wrap and dog talks, let alone the people's more vulgar expressions that the figures are allowed.
The argument is not even a flight membership in the Creator Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship of a man with a dog must also be knowledge of a craft if one wants to tell a believer story.
This failed in this case.
There's a little too much erotic for a good family shot and a minimum feeling for the genre.
Even as an ad on canisterapia, this amateur-accepted piece wouldn't have passed.
Yes, respect, 'cause they have to listen to the constant passages just from assholes like you.
There's a difference between bidding and forced, here you can see how shit you understand, but that's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such kids all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in it's an award brigade.
Near East suffers unusually dry months.
Cold is the only time in the year it rains.
"At a very close absence of precipitation in November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual," says the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term friction average in November.
Therefore, the two-day rain from this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, rejoicing Nazareth's people, Wasim Askar.
The precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, they are impactful and irregular.
The forests are addicted to the winter rains.
Without them, they're susceptible to fires.
It's not just the woods, it's also the supply of drinking water and the floor for farmers.
The biggest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilee lake, was filled this spring with the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has declined.
Watercare warned before dry a long time ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, the precipitation may be spent here," said the spokesman of the Israeli Water Management Office in 2018, Uri Schor.
Israel can help with technologies such as isolation or recycling of wastewater.
There are worse economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tank cars come.
Waters and private wells dry.
“This year, my orders were up by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years,” said Imad Sulejman, in September, the driver of the tank car.
In Iranian Isfahan, there were conflicts between farmers and security forces.
The reason for protests was dry.
The Koryto of the local river came completely without water.
The region has been carrying out the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing military action against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister declared that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and that he informed Washington of the preparations of the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz stated on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, informs Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the US, is trying to convince Americans to exert their pressure on Iran, but also inform Washington of military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and world power “know that Iranians were messing with them.”
About three years ago, this happened to me.
I used to squeeze a little lady and grill in the interview to find out what he wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these cons, so I've had a little bit of doubt and questions, and I finally thanked you and left.
You can tell me I'm a jerk, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, waited for them enough snow and nice weather
The mountain resort in the Czech Republic has experienced the first major challenge of skiers this weekend.
After an efficient snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow, and some skiareals have started operation.
The conventioner has not dissuaded neither the obligation to prove itself with covid certificate in the trawls.
While trainers do not complain about customers' interest, some ski equipment lending companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemics.
To the tracks of the conventions, thousands of people in the Liberec region went on a weekend.
Skiers wished the weather, which offered today the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are pleased, the opening weekend has really come out since Friday night skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill,” he commended the interest of the director of the Sports Area Ještěd Jakub Hanusz.
Hundreds of people went to Jesenice for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the Branné in Šumperska opened.
The weekend's visit was very decent, even today it came to an estimated 400 people.
Conditions are great.
Today, sunlight was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praiseful representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after the covid-19 disease has been recovered.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared and demonstrated with the necessary documents, said ČTK René Hrones from skicentre Špindler's Mlýn.
“We only recorded an incident unit,” he added.
Less interest than before the pandemics reports some rentals and ski equipment shops.
Fortunately, the interest in borrowing skis is.
It's not like in the past years, but there's still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokiš from the oath shop Skiopava.
Greater resistance is expected during ski courses.
Also, the king’s manager of Snowbear David Šinták feels that covid is not such interest in borrowing ski equipment as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
We're at about 50 percent compared to the pandemic period, said ČTK Šinták.
The people according to him were lazy with pandemics and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a rental in Novako on God’s Dar.
They started to borrow skis there a week ago, and the participants have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to borrow the runs this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we expect great interest as last year,” said the operator of the area Pavlína Nováková.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also related to ski school.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, there must be a chance to experience quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not belong to socialist health, where it is often impossible to get a dentist or a specialist.
The smart and smart people who don't have any property are leaving abroad.
The company's owner won't leave abroad.
But with the rest of it completely agreed.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban one beautiful day, the year ruled and suddenly the annual immigration raised by a few dozen thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic from day to day can't find itself in a similar position.
The next question is the choice.
If he's going to live here stupid, he can win some traditional V4 madman here too.
Young and educated will leave, remain his supporters and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
A frightening photo!
Langmajer's blood on a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic he was in the full stream of autumn, in Thailand the staff of the film Island headed with Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
At the same time, an actor published a bloody face photo on social networks.
Is it a real injury, or is it about the shooting?
London police are still looking for the missing Czech Republic.
Last time she was seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not exactly like her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where Srnce worked.
"His family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her, and she just wants to know where she is," she continued.
She was missing on Sunday 28 November, around 19:45, she left work and headed home to Camberwelltown.
The last time she was seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance reported on December 3, one of her associates.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as “a assistant to nurses” at the children's hospital Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belonged under the Guy's and St Thomas hospital associations.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing," said a group of health facilities.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help her find to contact the police," continued the communication.
The public is also invited by Mrs Harriet Harman, who, on Saturday, pointed out the Srnc case at the press conference.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried about death," said the labourist politician, holding the photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel that we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and worked here for our health,” said Harman.
The police have already arrested a man in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC's news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what a man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don't appreciate Ukraine like that either.
They're not "great quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine continues to repeat that we are experiencing the threat of Invasus and begins to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted war.
The war is a bloody expensive fun, and Russia has a GDP of Italy.
Comparison with the 38th situation is out of line at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first punk war and the "nexí" silica :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that she is not going to comply with the agreements of Minsk, Russia acknowledges the ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be like.
That, the pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague, new schedules apply from Sunday, mainly suburban connections
Travelers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which are particularly related to suburban connections.
There are new lines, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslav is now involved in the integrated system.
In the capital since Sunday, fasters from České Budějovice are stopped at the Garden City Station.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will be driven by the Czech Brod to the Prague main station on the route from Beroun.
In the recently operated Prague-Zahradní Město will stop rychlík R17 from Českých Budějovic and Benešova.
PID is now spread to other areas.
Among other things, the buses will go to the Light over Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, the Old Splaves and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslav, including lines with a crossing of the Liberec and Královnéhradské region.
When integrating, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new will be introduced, and 12 functioning will be adjusted.
The new bus line 405 will go from Prague Zličín to Žatka.
There was also a new direct connection to Prague – Kralovice near the Rakovnik, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They'll be strengthened in the morning tip and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Raquaker, when the express line number 404 will be released.
Newly are included in the PID system lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec Region.
They travel from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The spinal line 400 goes through the Ramník, the Dubou and the Czech Lyp to New Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes over the Shouldnik and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonny in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the new operation on the tens of the Central Bohemian local lines, including Mochova, Dobřeša, or Rožmitála pod Třemšínem, is limited.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernisation of the railways, the long-term restrictions on the lines of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and nearby Kolína continue.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend sections on line 420 from Dobřích with the following from Prague where the PID ticket can be used to Milevska.
The change has occurred between 540 and 543 lines in Nymburg and the routes of some buses at the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovicka in Plzeňský kraj.
Healthy jacket/summer to the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option to get food, it's to go next to Billy or a little bit further into Lidle.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the power to practice after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietally as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and at speed, I'll buy maximum pizza gel and apple and yogurt snack.
Question: what would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket without the need for heat adaptation?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only a tree tip can hide under the snow.
If it falls, the tree can be more vulnerable to mushroom disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're forbid us to ride outside the convention, but it's one of them.
A confession of the Dara's relationship with the Insight: This is not what I've been looking forward to.
The Czech show business pond from Friday lives nothing other than the discovery of Dary Rolins and Paul Nedvěd.
They've been hanging out for years, a famous footballer even got a divorced because of a singer.
The gift now sent a huge message to fans, explaining why love had been hidden from them for a long half years.
"I would like to say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who escaped that Dara caught a bear, i.e. a pardon, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in the most successful Czech footballer in love with her ears.
He said he packed her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and even though they're used to public interest, they're not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen once, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care about it and jump out of cans, or we, whose lives are in detail dispersing.
As if one of you wanted to hear the opinion of whether you and your husband and your girlfriend are good enough, or you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your former partners and were familiar with the reading of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, that's what you're doing, it's bothering you, Dara.
The two were assembled in Italy, where Rolins drove to prepare her new fashion collection.
The Witness is again in the long term as vice president of the football club Juventus.
They went out with the truth until now because they were waiting for the Ned's divorce to be completed.
Ivan's wife has been separated for three years, but they're not married for three weeks.
Anyway, those who rejoice with us and wish us, thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
And that is why I love my new man, and as he is with me, I am standing by him, and in good and in evil, she shut down Rolins.
Hey, the other commentants probably said everything important, just confirming that colleges are great at the beginning, my classmates usually met during the first semester or two and made friends, and then they found out what we're doing together, which makes me feel like the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments don't usually go forward too long, so I don't think you'll find much now, but look at the offer won't hurt.
Otherwise, go away not only Ceil, but also the surroundings (the streets such as Vranovská, French, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some of the Jewish parts are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is a lot of students, the King's field, and that's the right direction, except that it's close to most VUT faculty (I don't know exactly where you're boarding).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native Bronk, so I can, if there's any more information you've been missing :)
But that's an example of "normal" thinking.
As a result of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly okay that the state does not finance certain schools sufficiently.
Either they learn what they want and pay it from their own or whether they go by state and pay the state.
We can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he's going to bring a few crowns to a full state contribution and he's going to be able to teach what he wants in school.
Such statements are somewhat lost on the vase when a person who has written it two days before expressing his petition for the totalitarian state's fight:
So the vote against if anyone's going to abort is the same for you as a voice against any statue standing on the square?
If I were you, I'd consult with the guy who was asking you the job.
Otherwise, I've seen in catalogue/digitization that (and even for a long period of professionals) it's either thrown from the eye, or they'll write something into the xxx *** or ... (as convention) and point out that it's impossible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in the note that you use the program.
If you'd like to be a good and hard student, you can look into some character databases and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're pulling out of some book, I'd say that the author or the pressman simply made his own mark that sits with what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't this the Odry Empire, by chance, rather than the OdryNska?
PSS: You've already been settled.

Politicians have no idea what will be the "themate" of our Presidency.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The imagination that they would approve of something because no one understood a text is a smile.
All the valid approved documents are examined by a word from the word, and anyway, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's the case of lawyers.
In different EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for non-formal relations, overstandard relations.
In addition, it is quite interesting with this English performance, after GB from the EU.
I don't get that hatred on the Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work at 10 night and never any problem.
That it's just a ghetto that can say someone who's barely stepped in there in his life.
Yeah, there's probably most of the Romani population in Brno, but all they do is that they're going to block the sidewalk and park where they don't have:D, it's certainly not that I'm afraid to get out there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap place to live with good access to the center, I'd just go into it.
Plenty of apartments are now renovated or newly built there.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dad and lovers Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's going to spend Christmas with?
On Sundays, most of the people in the advental prison have burned the first candle, not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an advent prisoner, so there's nothing to light.
I've seen the grandfather's work, and Lucia certainly has one, said to Lightning saxophonist, who so confirmed the words of Patras, that he visits her often.
He visits, but he doesn't live in their house in the Vinohrads, where Dad was left alone after he left.
Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We just met with Angela, Felix and both grandchildren.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem:
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen for Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I buy gifts continuously, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, I guess perfume.
I'm a gentleman, he added Felix, who came to the baptism of a music video to the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel like myself.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says the Slovak who was happy to meet the wife of Luďka Sobota Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to settle this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, then explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be planted in hospitals in the crisis.
The cops are few, and they can't afford it, so are firefighters and nowhere else such a high percentage of well-trained people at such a level is not.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, she's been begging for new toys long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change the agricultural subsidy, the landscape should not only be a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic has been passing through the worst period of drought in the last few years.
The waters according to scientists remained in the mountain and mountain areas, a smaller sum of precipitation also recorded locations where there was not yet an emergency about the flag.
The cause of drought, which is held in the large part of Central Europe, is a climate change.
But it also strengthens the way we operate with the land.
What about dry preparation?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I'm barely sticking in ice skates, mushrooms I know what to play hockey and the tactics (I've tried at Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total haluz.
And whether you're a hockey team, "Russian Bear" or "Llama China" so lose two goals even though you don't have to win the game at any cost is different than when it's compared.
But anyway, what I'm listening to Czech commentators who are experiencing, what judges do not notice whether a male or female hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
The controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way, it's like it's always been, and that Czech Republic and Russia had lost more often than it won, it would probably be the classic "voni lost" vs "We won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
The hospitalized is 5766 people.
Overall, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29 929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it's the lowest daily number of dead from the end of October.
Britain faces a large wave of disease caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on TV Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical consultant for the British Health Safety Office.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Persons infected with omicroline are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one died on omicron, but there are about 14 days after the disease and about three weeks after the disease.
The chief of the British workers Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by the last December, when the lockdown was introduced and the Christmas parties were banned, he arranged a Christmas quiz in Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually" through the computer.
But he was involved in a staff group in Downing Street, gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure on Johnson's removal from the Prime Minister's office is increasing.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, the ministers of Johnson organized, despite the lockdown of numerous parties.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial TV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won a vicious majority in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party speaks of the need to remove it from the Prime Minister's function.
Remarkable how fast the events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for elections in the spring, which can end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be the election of the European significance.
How much can you expect the fair ones to be?
They're not fair.
They're probably not even free because they weren't even the last two elections under Orban.
His side of Fidesz controls the media, changes the borders of the election circles to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like everyone in practice can vote wherever he wants to.
This will allow Fidesza to bind voters from the decisive circles to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he even has a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will receive a united opposition.
It's for Viktor Orban and his side's great unusual.
Aren't they trying to keep the power to play harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, she escaped to independent media the recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fides László Kövér, where she says that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Is that the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been struggling quite often, the last time in 14, my mom's parents have no patience, I don't, Dad has a long time, but then he's gonna blow extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very cholery and angry as a little awful, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in the cramp and all was blue, it took about 2 times under my shower to calm down.
Sometimes my education was stunning, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I certainly have the tendency to solve things with violence, as a little bit of a fight, now I've been fighting for at least to hit something, and as younger as I have, I'm supposed to have the parents knocked over my hand like that (to never get too much over my hand), so nothing extreme, but I always have the need.
I'm not able to determine what extent that's my explosive, but I'm sure it's got its share of education.
I'm afraid I'm also gonna lose my patience with my kids and deal with the same thing.
I think it's just wrong to beat the kids and that my parents shouldn't do it, especially at the moment that it wasn't "excellent," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks something, and I don't think it's possible for my kids to get a little scary, so I don't blame them.
I'm not insulting it. I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
So I would call Kundami what the laws form in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying a product and you're gonna have a mortgage on what?

Where will Slovakia move the process with the killers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four defendants of the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnír.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
The civil society was moving, but it also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kočner and its connection to the tips of Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial will the process for Slovakia mean?
It's a huge reporter's fault.
How is it possible that this petition had a regular medial attention than the denial counterpers of all the medical faculties that came out of the day, two later?
No, they got crazy, and the company jumped off.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the collection of storage nowhere
The proposal by Minister Karl Havlíček needs to recast in principle
The government of Prime Minister Andrei Babiš is the end and the law to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of deep storage of high radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government's Legislative Board has interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after the summer courses.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities concerned in the Platform against deep storage, but also with the Czech Union and the Czech Municipalities.
The governments of the law expect a greater strengthening of their options in the decision on the storage that the mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which demands the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to recast the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposal of the law from Minister Karl Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, addresses the municipalities in particular: The suggested degree of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the decision to choose the site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if the municipalities or the public may affect whether the process will even continue in that location.
This may be ensured by the imposition of the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the opening of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a matter of intention almost completely opposes the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically just statistics in the authorisation procedures.
The proposal lacks system configuration of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of search and selection of sites for storage, authorisation and operation.
The representatives of the municipalities in real terms according to today's legal standards do not have much to defend the interests of their citizens in searching for a storage place.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may submit their comments or withdraw, but the Authority or the Minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation.
Any action shall not have a delayed effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The common principle is to be used in many democratically developed countries and is certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another government failure to prepare the legislation to hire external legal offices.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and consequently on contracts with lawyer Jane Zemánko.
The total amount of these works according to the contract register is to make about 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, the town of Cejle from the locality of Hrádek and spokesman Platform against the deep depositary said: After the Ministers of Industry, who have aligned the position of self-government to the state authorities in searching for deep storage of highly radioactive wastes, we have only been waiting for a more significant turnover from the new government.
We also offer a hand to do it.
We also thank the Union of cities and municipalities, which sees the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities in such an essential building as the municipalities in selected areas.
The platform against deep-sea storage shall be associated with 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to implement changes in the state's access to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that will not be limited to deep storage.
The Platform further urges that the decision to select the site for any storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Herce John Goodman (69) forced fear to be silent: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything in his lifestyle for years, he was finally frightened by doctors.
They told him he'd die if he didn't.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 pounds, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, informs The Sun's journal.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated show The Freak Brothers.
There's a completely different person from the Roseanne sitcom!
John liked to joke that his friends and his family asked him to lose weight because his big body caused the cracking furniture.
"I pushed everything into my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.

It also depends on what boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects a player from a game environment, I wouldn't have translated it at all.
If it were formal and, for example, college text, I'd probably be looking for the boss to describe or explain.
There are more kinds of bosses to all.
Like a game like the Dark Souls etc. has a number of bosses, yes, and so there's a "boss" kind of like the master/man of the level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who do not need to defeat the game or level to be completed, but often are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then maybe there are half-Life games where the bosses are, but the player doesn't get directly stuck with them (Tentacle, Gargantua) and they can even be called?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's a one-speaking way to translate the boss, it's probably not even possible, Czech, and no other languages are dealing with it somehow (it's just the Catalan that boss translates as a final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game of general importance, a computer controlled, adversary stronger than all the previous and guarding completion of some level or task.
After the missing Peter of London, he's looking for the whole world.
The Czech police are involved.
After the missing Peter Srnc, the British police have been searching since December 3.
The Czech police are involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherscograde has been looking for since December 7th.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
The Czech Petra Srncová saw her colleagues last November 28th.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol released a so-called yellow circular for her.
So Peter is looking for the whole world.
"The Czech police work closely with the British police," she confirmed the police spokesman Kateřina Rendl.
"We share information to the case together," she added.
The declared search for Peter has appeared on the police website.
According to him, it's 168 centimeters tall, it's thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair the same color.
It should come from Uherscohradisk.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Mrs Harriet Harman was involved in the search for Peter.
She's involved in the airplanes hanging with Petra's face.
"We have great concerns about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, the British police have arrested one suspect.
But it's not clear who it is and what he had to do with Petra.
The prevailing Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, with the close end of the year, the attacks increased significantly.
We recorded a large campaign with Agent Teslo on November 18th.
Attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of attackers remains the same for now.
The infected e-mail Annex should raise attention to the user's name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month she had a dangerous attachment in the name the word invoice, this time it was marked as a Kopie repair of receipts for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
The damaged code actively seeks stored login data that subsequently sends to the offenders.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year the attackers' activity is growing again.
In November he remained active and spyware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, in this case, attackers do not specifically focus on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November captured a campaign with a global range.
Compared to the October Formbook data in November, he was slightly weakened, but still worth a little five of all detections.
Attacks were ongoing continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contained the most common attachment to the .exe file that did not bear the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the bill appears further.
The annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
Significant decline and exacerbation of activities are reported by security analysts in the Fareit programme, which was worth 1.6 percent of the attacks and had no greater attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.
The smart-ass demo today that doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vacant jerks.
Prahou was bigger than the media said.
According to the footage of the parade after the sea, and according to my experience of the demonstrator, I'm not afraid of estimates of around 10,000 people.
People in the parade have filled the seaside and the bridge and the opposite coastal communication.
That means a lot of people.
About four thousand demonstrators are joined spontaneously in the parade.
I say something new is born here, says Radek Wet.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or the layers of the population led to the finding of a common speech.
Only the lonely antivaxers, anti-roucheers, and the squad would not be able to fill or pay such a big parade.
The event of the group Chcípl dog has an upcoming popularity, it reminds me of a million minutes for democracy at the bottom.
Sometimes I feel like they rent the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what a movement of dissatisfaction could be paid from this dissatisfaction, not only depends on the cash flow, but whether the triple-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not make a square and more dose.
It's definitely not a left or medium movement, bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose, because it is obvious that we will have to get overdose every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists that humanity is proud of.
End of patch, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister of Declaring Change
The Bulgarian President Rumen Radev empowered Kiril Petkov's new government from the counter-corruption movement to continue the change that won the November elections.
This has already managed to build a government of a broad coalition that should take over the office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been taking place since April when the past government has lost the election under the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winners of the fight against bribes and abuses of power failed to agree, so there were still two premature elections.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
A global hit is from the secretly acquired shots.
In Britain, the concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czechs have grown on the weekend, for which the London police have been searching for for several days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British metropolitan.
After information on the worker, the child hospital is calling, except for the police, its current employer or a Member representing the part of London, where she lived.
"The disappearance of Petra is not exactly like her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where Srnce worked.
"His family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her, and she just wants to know where she is," she continued.
She was missing on Sunday 28 November, around 19:45, she left work and headed home to Camberwelltown.
The last time she was seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance reported on December 3, one of her associates.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as “a assistant to nurses” at the children's hospital Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belonged under the Guy's and St Thomas hospital associations.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing," said a group of health facilities.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help her find to contact the police," continued the communication.

In Ústí nad Labem evil moon hole in the road in the form of a channel without a hatch.
It was about life.
The Magistrate referred to the complaints of the RSD that belonged to the road, and because it did not react, the hole of evil continues.
Finally, the authorities have clarified their responsibility and ownership, and after a month, the RZSD began to "intensely deal with the situation".
