Inflation in Europe has jumped for food
The rapid inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to continuous growth in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October was registered annual inflation of 3.1 percent, announced the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast foreseen only 3 percent, told by Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian Emergency Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate that a reduction in raw material prices would lead to an inflation spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below two percent, but close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in a ridiculous situation: inflation has to "rescue" in order to do nothing in this matter later.
In Germany, the November inflation is 3.3 percent of the 15-year record, and in Spain, it grew from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflations in the euro area were ripped up because of sharply rising food and energy prices.
The timetables of wheat increased by 88 percent, also the soybean course reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and milk products.
The price of oil on the world markets in this year increased by 52 percent and one barrel of black gold has already stood last month.
According to the ECB, inflation will fall from this year 2.1 percent to 2.5, but in 2009 it will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation will remain approximately 3% in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees the government's crisis
The Fidesz movement’s overseas has increased significantly for the beginning of December and has now had the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured so low - 13% of the aid.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support compared to the five-in support of the IASP.
MDF and SZDS are, according to the survey, under the threshold for entry into Parliament: their support throughout the population is two percent.
Among certain party voters the two camps are one percent more.
In view of the previous minima, the public's view has been deteriorated - there has never been a ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
The families evaluate the change of their material situation after spring and summer more prospects now more pessimistic.
With regard to the next year, there is a higher proportion of the population with further deterioration and only ten with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the questions were judged, which is most of all the surveys of the Gallupa Institute that the Prime Minister was doing his work rather badly than well.
Ference of Gyurcsana believes or very much believes 13 percent of the questioned, while at Viktor Orban the proportion of the supporters is 38 percent.
Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent, President of Fidesh's 27 percent movement.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is how much part of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While last October’s disturbances were considered to be 35 percent of the government’s persistence and the Prime Minister, this share is now only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) only in the purchasing of new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is apparent that 60 percent of the questions in question were answered to the question concerning their possible participation that the referendum would definitely come to the referendum, and the next 20 percent said that it would likely come.
For comparison, "parlamental elections held this Sunday" would certainly only take part in 55 percent and another 15 percent considered its participation probable. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no 74, doctor's 79 fees and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the range of people who promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital fees would decline 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost five has murdered Tesco.
Hypermarkets in the Budaörse trading triangle remained last year, on average 16% price level growth, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article journal Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas Consumer Basket Log Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörse Trade Triangle this year increased by 16 percent average, but in all hypermarkets, an increase of over a thousand forints has been shown in price.
Since prices in the supermarkets of food "leaded" last December, there was no such drastic health in proportion to the previous high base.
However, it is certainly unhappy for consumers that what they could have bought last year at a price of under nine thousand forints will not now take even ten thousand.
The Daily Economy Consumer basket in Tested hypermarkets exceeded a psychological limit of 10,000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the excise basket was 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last level, but very cruel breasts, nuts, as well as poppy.
Prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found kilogram bread and forints for 139 forints.
The competition didn't go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
Also, it was surprising in this shop that the price of two-litre Coca Coly in the door bottle was below 200 forints, so it also cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, it appeared according to the excise diary Napi Gazdaság Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices were rising in Napi Gazdaság's Consumer Log, due to the prices last year at Christmas Cora, while Tesco and Auchan were about 18 percent.
When compared last year, the lowest value of the consumer basket was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's maximum was 21 percent.
In the forintech there was an average of 1 480.
The average increase in prices last year was 1 206 forints, with last Christmas prices affected by VAT growth.
This process has just disrupted trade, trade houses have clearly failed to decide how large price margins should be established for each product, as they could not predict the effect of changing prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the circulation rate of the product in question wrongly, the price margin adjusted to circulation may lose significant profit.)
Due to VAT, last year, the increase in the price of the excise basket Napi Gazdaság showed so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest price difference in all of the 844 forints was 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference was not revealed, the most expensive basket now stood by 1 630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest underwriting by 1 284 forints.
In comparison to both Christmas seasons, catastrophic price increases appeared, in less than 20 months, the daily consumption in hypermarkets undercuts by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, does not completely confirm the Central Statistical Office’s data: it measured in the case of several basic foods an increase in prices exceeding 30 percent in 12 months.
Apart from flour, for example, in case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the Consumer Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, as the price level of the product, which was expensive last year, has demonstrated a price growth of almost 10 percent, even in the worst case.
The meal suppliers have taken stronger positions than the egg suppliers, and the dramatic increase in prices has succeeded in the international chains.
Hypermarkets in the golden triangle do not complain, still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers are no longer interested in the price in three visited shops.
They're buying all quantum, long-term foods, they're getting paid.
In the middle of the morning, in all three supermarkets there were long fronts at the treasures, because the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, there is a lower turnover on the country, many international chains complain to research firms that they are holding their plans, not only in food, but also in the case of durable consumables.
In many places, it is spared on disinfectants
In this year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals mainly due to inappropriate antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the overfill of beds, the overload of personnel do not help the disease, claim the prime minister of the National epidemiological Center.
In many places, it is also spared on disinfectants.
Recently, the MRSA infection was diagnosed in the St. John's Hospital traumatological department.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics were discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious transport accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but soon after he had to return with the MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body was still unable to perform one important operation.
By 10 December this year, 1 094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistent disease agents were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, Karolina Böröczová, Prime Minister of the National epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistent disease agents have been registered in hospitals with certainty, they don't know about others.
Almost two thirds (683) of infections have been caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilline resistant gold staphylococol.
The bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bears a third of the people in their nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. neck inflammation, almond inflammation, skin infection, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excess or inappropriate extent, it will develop from a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics of the bacteria which is very resistant to antibiotics and which is rapidly spreading in unsatisfactory hospital conditions.
Especially in case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years may cause serious hospital infections such as early infection or sepsis.
According to the Chief Doctor of St. John’s Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections include daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not interfere with the epidemic, the MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease agent is not investigated."
Resisting antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nurses are treated in rubber gloves and in a mask and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether the MRSA is present in their body, however, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample collection is not in fashion
Most of the hospital infections caused by MRSA could be avoided, but the current ratios and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable for the prevention and dissemination of multi-resistent disease agents, Karolina Böröczová claims.
As these infections occur in hospitals and homes for seniors, the hospitals receiving MRSA should be insulated immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays the role that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these tests.
Most cases are revealed so, if the patient suffers from the apparent MRSA infection, the prime minister of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotics therapy is targeted, or microbiological examinations should be performed in order to avoid resistant to medicines, but do not comply with this in all cases.
The collections of microbiological samples are even more rare in primary, acknowledged by Karolina Böröcz.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, the MRSA is spread among patients most often through medical personnel.
It therefore plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
The MRSA is carried with liquid infection and touch, but in the domestic conditions of hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, although patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other from the epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately, we can also meet in hospitals that are located in a negative material situation, saves on disinfectants, nurses are few, and patients are a lot, thereby increasing the chances of infection.
According to Carolin Böröcz, the necessary protective measures, similar infections are proven to be less or further spread of the disease agent may be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infections represents huge expenses for health insurance companies, and therefore fights everywhere.
For example, the government has written an MRSA prevention programme in England, a respectable reduction in its presence.
As it seems, the program is successful, according to the published data, the MRSA infection in England shows a decreased tendency.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Disease Control (ECDC) includes the prevention of multi-resistent disease agents (measures including MRSA), respectful hospital infections caused by these disease agents, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused a fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of Captain XXII Police District, which caused a fatal accident, is done.
It can be ruled out that a police captain of the 21st District, who killed the Walker on Tuesday, who, in the meantime, resigned from his function, was led under the influence of alcohol or dementia, informed the spokesman of the Prime Minister of the Attila Morvai capital on Friday after the expert evaluation of this case was completed.
The expert review confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which has already stated that the former police captain had not eaten alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
Today, the Director of Police Directorate of the 21st Century was hit on Tuesday in Lajose Kossutha Street in the 21st century by a private car in turning a 50-year-old man who joined him in crossing the road outside the designated transition.
(The last name of the fact that the walker crossed off the ground, as well as the road traffic rules are not easy, the turning car must still be preferred.)
After he moved to the hospital, the walker died.
Because of these events, the District Police Director resigned and asked for the transfer to the service, according to the police's communication, because he was shaken enough.
In the case of an investigation by the Budapeszt State Prosecutor.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had worked with the state attorneys conducting the investigation from the start.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks of EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, signed on Friday in Budapest the Minister for Finance János Veres and Mart Gajeck, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects, implemented by the Cohessian Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with the parties already concluded a loan contract of 100 million, now signed the contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
It also serves a credit agreement of EUR 150 million for the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB approved EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, with the extension of the credit agreement, for the use of the remaining EUR 150 million.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which the budget would mainly apply to the research and development project of the University of Debrecine.
There was also talk about the 4th metro route at the meeting.
The Parties agreed that after Hungary agrees with the EU's details of metro financing, it would return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to Janos Verese, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary since 1990 to 113 projects.
The interest of the loans provided by the EIB with an eighth waiting period and without an undertaking commission is linked to EURIBOR’s rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the attention of Europe is turning to the formerly a little omissioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys the cheapest, but with the rapidly irritating EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most wanted eastern European objective of buying real estate is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski suites and homes on the sea coast.
The mountains are the most in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Gold sands, Sun coast, ancient cities Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are also searching for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balčika.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria will sooner or later raise interest from investors and central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more interested ones will also purchase in the surroundings of the cheap city of Russia.
The capital city of Sofia is also a promise of lunar possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of the most attractive golf paradises of Europe, and thus to become next to the summer and winter seasons that are sought the destination of the journeys even in the next two seasons.
Foreseeable investors are already shopping in large, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lifestyle and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain, and still more often from Romania.
There are also Maltese and cyper investors, at the Black Sea and there are traditionally many Russian customers in ski paradises.
The foreign buyer of the climb split into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The established people buy either the renovated properties worth €50-100,000, or the old houses are lost for €5-15,000, which are then renovated.
They require good availability and communication options, it is important for them to be close to a large city, shops and usually a local physician.
The second categories are coupons (Bulharsko has ranked among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group is commercial investors who buy in the hope of increasing value in the medium or long term.
Real estate abuse in the capital is continuous, because demand is increasingly stronger.
While there are the lowest real estate prices in Bulgaria in the European Union, in the last five years they grew by 21 percent per year.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds the growth of salaries.
Fodores and Hungarian six percent
According to the information of the Minister for the Environment and Water and Administration of Gábor Fodor, the meetings of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and after the Wednesday official launch, the International Conference on Climate Mode after 2012 will continue the negotiations of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are dealing with a Travel Map from Bali, which deals with efforts following the reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol valid until 2012.
At this point, there is a stormy debate between developing and advanced countries.
The United States also announced that they would not now want to deal with precise numbers, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020, given the status in 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will come, except for reducing emissions, also to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, probably within the World Environmental Programme (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
Hungary’s six percent
The Minister for the Environment and Waters of Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the efforts to protect global climate and help the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU undertakes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "contracts after 2012", and is ready to commit to up to 30% reductions in the event that other developed areas of the world, respectably developed countries will be willing to take responsibility and commitments corresponding to their possibility.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 have reached the target of a reduction of 5,2 percent, with the 15 EU Member States now committed to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country. - it is recalled in the press report to the Ministry of the Environment.
In Bali, it is a great deal, because in two years, an international agreement on long-term climate change should be adopted, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would be moved up to 2012. In this case, the IPCC, which is the subject of the Nobel Peace Prize, would not be immediately linked to a new system of reducing emissions, which was necessary in its latest report.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in average temperatures on Earth by more than 2 degrees of Celsia, which, according to scientists, would have exceptionally serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
The British military units publish on a server for sharing video recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which themselves popularize themselves.
First, YouTube liked the British Air Force (RAF): the special units operating in Afghanistan have recorded videos from the Taliban events since March 2006, announced BBC.
Records, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the air force commander in the Kandahar area and then sent to London where they are transmitted to the internet.
Political message is inevitable
This form has already received 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers, and more than 75,000 people have looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and published recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Establishment in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original purpose for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to meet the general public with the actual aim of the presence of the army abroad.
"Promotions published in this form compared to traditional television recruitment advertising almost nothing is worth," said the BBC expert on the defence issues Gordon Mackenzie, "but it is essential to bear a political message in it, as the special form confirms the right to the military action that the government has decided."
Americans made a game
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully modified censored recordings, amateur videos are also being received on the server, showing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, the officers are talking about losses, but they do not show a bloody like the fight.
In addition, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been made on the Internet, but the British army has come to them now.
The Americans recruit a little different - using a shooting game named America's Army, which is free to download and where the player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through more or less faithful simulation.
There will be Christmas at the ministries with rabbits and pagats
Mónika Lamperth's work is probably not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will organize a final work meeting for her coworkers, at which the 2007 sausages and coffee will be held.
At some ministries, a celebration with live music will be celebrated by the officials of the Christmas atmosphere with a toast and a toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the Swedish table - so they're having a great time.
For Christmas, the state's offices are preparing.
The most attractive ministerial Christmas celebration will be held by the Ministry of Defence this year, but he does not expect its employees.
At Christmas orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, during the Misij Christmas, family members of soldiers serving currently on foreign missions, but will also organize a reception for journalists.
The Resort is devoted to the atmosphere of the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are thrown out of a dome compared to other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and a total of six hundred employees of the Ministry are expected to be approximately three hundred fifty guests.
The Resort will hold Christmas traditions at his celebration, but it will also occur on various performances and it will also draw a rambola.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and held on Wednesday in the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - there were concerts and dinners on the program.
The rental of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is still invited to another Christmas party: the company will arrange the flow of tendrs, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented the theatre building Vígšinház.
MAG a. s. did not confirm that information as we failed to reach the relevant person.
No dress needed
The OIT building has not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which was organized by St. Lucia on 7 December.
However, the OIT did not want money from him in the use of her halls.
Five hundred people took part in the forest.
The party started by a health minister, after dinner, it was possible to dance for the escort of live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the dance, no compulsory evening dress or suit were required.
The Puritans' party is preparing health, work and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and a celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Mónika Lamperth's worker is not even officially invited to a Christmas party, but to the final work meeting.
There are hundreds of 80 guests who, according to the press release, only get coffee and paws, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply drink in the Aule of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas meeting, on which 436 employees expect in their own large hall.
The Christmas party devotes 2 500 forints to the guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toasts.
Since the Minister János Veres celebrates the PM Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will lack, the officiality will strengthen not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The Department of Agriculture organizes the 20th January New Year's reception, the Ministerial Christmas does not take place.
The reception will take place in the castle of Vajdahunyadvár in the City Sets and according to the Ministry's communication there are 1,000 forints per person for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, which will only be invited to the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with minor hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture don't organize Christmas parties at all, told the portal [origo] the relevant press department.
The price of Christmas celebrations of the Environmental Centre in the press department failed to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Artificial Museum.
It's down to the giant strike.
The association of the League unions, acknowledged by the National Association of Working Councils (MOS) will be set up by its stallion committee on Friday to coordinate the post-day unrestricted strikes.
On Saturday, a protest public assembly, on Monday - on the final day of the vote on the Health Insurance Act - will be stopped.
The actions will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport because the rail transport will almost completely stop and the staff of the Budapest transport company (BKV) will be postponed within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga association will meet the National Association of Working Councils with the details of the organized Monday strikes.
The LIGA - MOŠ, which will coordinate Monday's event, will also develop.
On Saturday, the protest public gathering takes place, from Monday, the unions joining the strike will stop work for an indefinitely period unless the government has reached an agreement.
This means that the deadline for the end of the strike is not set, starting on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament had not finally adopted the law on health insurance, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the legislation is voted, the Standing Commission will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to Parliament's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted only in late evenings, or night hours.
Due to the starting strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious traffic breaks: the rail will be stopped for an indefinite period, the morning may stop part of Budapest public transport and more than half of Volán.
At the same time, in many places, the country will also close halfways.
Many unions and civil organisations, whose list is kept updated on the Liga website, joined the call for strike.
Some organizations, and the strike for an indefinite period, have declared temporary stopping work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Staff (VDSS) have failed to agree on sufficient services, while more people are traveling on the rail by the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to the current communication, from the start of operation to 13 hours of the BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning at Budapest Airport, the four-hour strike will be organised by the LIGA branches of staff in the energy industry, to 2-, respectable 2-8 hours of stopping of the work called for the Department of Education and Democracy Association of Pedagogs.
The association of Hungarian doctors will be given a shift across the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Affairs (EDDZ) staff, belonging to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SESEF), hosting a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government revokes the proposal for a reform of health insurance and presents a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of counting pensions applicable as of next year should be implemented gradually.
The third is to ensure that early retirement for the relevant working areas can be included in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Staff (VDSZ), falling under the League trade union, does not accept the Ministry of Economy and Transport as regards railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the Jobbik Magyarorszagert movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital Institute, increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
In the "remark of the risk" created by the company, it is written: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian guards, the greatest political risk is that "the conspiracy of an already existing ethnic tension between the Romani and non-Roman population of Hungary can occur in short time also violent ethnic conflicts".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an action - is the research institution.
As he says, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political representatives: "the public discussion of the Roma issue has left representatives of public life to radical and extremist political groups who could oppose a political strategy on Romani-Maďar."
This is a problem that deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - judges the Institute.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard according to the research institute influenced the attention of domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent have shown the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards faith in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
The Institute recalls: a part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-regional groups, which have been increasingly publicized since autumn 2006, is that several organisations have been created in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which are called "national homes".
"The common feature of these groups is that they themselves define themselves as civilian associations, while they openly spell - even armed - ready to carry out their members with defence tasks (in the event of live disasters, attacks of the country, disturbances of order), and also with a point of inability to police, army, or state," he adds.
He also notes: all this is happening in a way that tries to wrap up the various political efforts of society against politics and parties in the civil coat.
Thus, the emphasis on civility and the form of the association does not serve in the case of these groups only to avoid the legal convergence of judicial registration, but it is also political strategies.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-enhancing player in the area of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, Hungary's City is pointed out in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries want to apologise their own anti-maďar policy.
This may all affect the political stability of the area," adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so the political risk for the area as a whole has increased.
As it says, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are, for example, similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which were announced in August 2007 by the ultra-registered National Union of Bulgaria (BNU).
On the back of the creation of the Bulgarian guards, the masses of Romani distress, which erupted in one of the Sophia quarters (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used to establish a guard with the purpose of the organization's "national domain".
In the past 17 years, she believes that there was a "cican terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained irrelevant and indifferent, reminiscent of the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has triggered a stormy discussion of the public in Bulgaria.
As he further states, an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts indicates the notification of certain Bulgarian Roma organizations that it will create its own City on the sign of resistance.
Since Hungary’s current activities show similarity to the activity of the Bulgarian national guards, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma react to a threat in a similar way, by setting up their own domain, we can read the risk alert developed by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, the research director of the Institute of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and, if they find something that might affect the risk change, they shall inform the public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk alert.
The holidays are not everywhere free.
In Hungary, the days of free are precisely laid down by the law and have become a general practice that they are moving around the holidays, which is awaiting us less times in the next year.
There are no single holidays in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
The days of working peace are mostly in relation to church holidays or to a significant historical event.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is working time - for the New Year for people to rest after the New Year.
In a year, we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the Revolution of 1848 and October 23, the memorial day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the establishment of a state, 1 May work, 1st and 2nd November, remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day Easter, Summer and Christmas holidays.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are rarely due to the calendar, we have become a practice of shifting the working day in cases that we only work one day before or after it.
However, the price for the prolonged weekends is that we stay in the workplace and school earlier Saturdays.
The day when the holiday is immediately preceding or following it, we will work out, has been adapting to the Minister of Labour in a special deliberation for many years.
The legislation shall apply in the same way to all employers and their employees, to the public staff and to the public service.
However, it does not concern companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or in view of their designation also operate on working days.
This year will change the working order only around the end of the year: from 24 December life in the country is almost stopped, because according to experience, most people have days between Christmas and Silvestr in advance "works" or will use the spared holiday.
A few of our holidays fall in the middle of the next year, respecting the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar turns around the holiday of work so that workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be the working day so that Friday 2 May may be the day of rest.
Another movement is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October will be working instead of Friday 24.
But the end of the year next year will be able to take place entirely in the signs of holidays, because from 24 December, they will have almost all over the holidays, even though the Silvestr is in the middle.
Six fearing little things you can upset your colleagues
E-mails that we will forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we will never notice: all this "speaks" every day in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these little unpleasantnesses, or you put on gloves and some misunderstanding situations that can be angry with others, you'll be deliberately avoiding.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will announce.
That's why you missed your possessions?
In better case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
The most common thing is a matter solved by one apology.
Before awkward apology has occurred, it is good to think about what you can prepare for your colleagues awkward moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than when you come up for some writing, office needs or for your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on the table last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find one of your colleagues on the table a pen that you thought was lost?
Without permission, don't take anything from your colleagues, otherwise they'll be right to get angry with you that you're messing with things.
Don't take covers or sticky papers from your office, because it might be uncomfortable if you get out early, and you'll need them immediately.
A private life rumour?
There's no good way to stop spreading rumors.
Who, who, who, what did he do with?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone on the nose of your messages about the private life of your colleagues!
When one of them share with you their most inner secrets, do not mislead his trust!
Lock what you heard in you, and don't discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and appeal to a strong headache you report your absence because you are not well, or you think that you'd better rest today, think that your work, your irresponsible tasks and work that have a certain term will have to do someone else for you.
Keep an eye on your colleagues!
If you know ahead that the next day you're not going to work, or that something that can happen will make you have to stay at home, report that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence to the next day.
Scrubbing, scrubbing, phone calls
Did you get immersed into a job you're gonna get roughly ripped out by a co-worker's hiking?
Are you unwantedly witnessing a phone conversation that would be better not to hear?
Don't interrupt your associates by singing, singing, loud call (except over your head), neither by assing, by constant clipping, by a loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disturbing even when they are not currently prevented from entering a project (written, planning, organization).
Are you accusing others of mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or a note, do not accuse others for your forgetfulness!
Don't appeal to any chaos in the office and glooming colleagues!
Admit it if you were mistaken and someone paid for it, and fix the injury!
Ask them how you could fix things, fix negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
Heat and parrots: comfortable at home, but it's not good for the office!
Don't take your clothes for your free time, even if it permits your profession!
Don't be negligible, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to your office in common clothes - and if your profession requires, nice and elegant!
If you want to fit, you stop being interesting.
Joining in the usual morning chase.
A special melody is called from the radio: the sound of the violin to which electronic effects are connected.
Adding volume.
Music changes pace and adds bass to the previous tone color, then as a real jewel joins the female congregation.
At the station, mr2 is the song of the Zagar group called Wings of Love.
The home music life hasn't just spoiled us in a high-quality electronic pop for a long time.
Suddenly, the clamp looks different because you're listening to the new album of Zagar.
The revelation of Yonderboy, a few new and interesting productions coming from home digital underground, changes the overall image slowly, and although it is again in the fashion garage rock with its bouquet into guitars, even domestic electropop shows that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the five-century, and he also played in Yonderboi's band, eventually - perhaps because two duds don't fit in one line - he made his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through until he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Töröka film "Szezon".
His formation, playing at the beginnings in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after the magazine wan2 enrolled their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important home boards and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as a so-called single domestic entities determining developments that could be sold even in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in course", although no one asked them, of course, if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band reacted as it belongs: made a new, better album.
Now released album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open a new path to them, although the name itself is trying to create a follow-up with early flights in the 5th century.
It is one verse of the composition of the old band Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the atherine, flying would be in place, but next to the etheric inspiration of this music has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the Millenaris board was introduced by the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the Puzzle group.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing lately from morning to evening popular music, we began to be stuck with a crushed music song Wings of Love, played with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's fine (?)
The Hvg.hu portal corresponds to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is offered, how much is what you play, marginal music?
Balázs Záger: Definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different casts of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternatives and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and that's how it can only be made for sale, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can be made of honest inner needs.
In this spirit, the attitude that is adopted is independent of the language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign publications against your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us west, it has light music more traditions.
There aren't just teenagers and people in 20, but older.
Much more follow the transformations of light music running around them, because they also consider it a part of the courtesy culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, how much of your music is listening to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more people go to our concerts.
But we never did music for the market.
We don't have music to be born with a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more in concerts where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the invincible transformations of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that when you want to meet the audience, it has become interesting since then.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow Yonderboie's example?
He works sololy, and he built his career rather than us west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how our music sometimes try to explain.
We're more like team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid that our work was not compared to Yonderboy's songs, for several of us were separated from his band and went a different way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the station Mr. Petőfi was made by Wings of Love in the first place.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
More popular styles have you been consciously opened up with wider layers?
B.Z.: We shouldn't have planned to write a hit that we would sell the board.
There's more in that song.
We thought it as the album final, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complicated topics.
Hvg.hu: In what way did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The imagination was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then the idea came to build this choir from a soloist home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-membered congregation was assembled - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we then baptized at Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: Is that exactly how you thought the song, or did the girls recast something on it?
B.Zs.: The composition has been in the instrumental version for a long time when the material on the board came together, we thought there would be something else needed for this song.
The chords' satched to join him in a singing band.
That day at night, I sang on him a melody that later girls learned.
It all worked out almost for the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember how it turned out, but of course, it needed Diva.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energy.
Hvg.hu: Both on the board and on the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together, and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They stood in the back of the stage, too.
Is that intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they stood back was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even this song is about us to forget a little about our ego, from where he is, where he belongs, and let us just let those wings, wings of love rise up.
I wish this euphoric condition that we felt when the song was born, the others felt.
Hvg.hu: Which was the most of the work?
B.Z.: While composing music, even with one, harder pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work groove for a long time, then all went slowly to find a place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new board is your favorite?
B.Z.: It's still changing by concerting, even by having already released the album.
Now it's the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A traited broker risked billions of less valuables
A despicable defraudant.
This is how he refers to his fearful employee, Jerom Kerviel, a French bank gigant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Commercial Bank.
She lost five billion euros for him.
It seems more like Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to cope with his colleagues and, moreover, definitely not incompetent.
Unlike all the large banking homes, he recognized at the time of the crisis in the US market of mortgages.
"He's mentally weaker," he sounded out of the mouth of his superiors who sent the police to him.
However, as Kerviel’s statement brought by the French media, such as Le Monde's journal, it was a man who had profits of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything I wanted to make money for my bank," says in the statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
The opportunity has already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages provided by low-prime clients or those who had problems with repayment in the past will have problems.
However, the whole economy had no influence on this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profit came up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I earned the first half-million, I didn't know how to announce it," he admits Kerviel and adds that he definitely kept nothing for himself.
He admits in his whole interrogation that he was falsifying records so that he didn't come to him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even when he started to care about his stores, Eurex.
Risk was profit
He was afraid he'd come to him?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take the will to take so much risk?
He must have gradually worked at his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual payment of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much money as the others.
"On my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
For my education, as well as for professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the start, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's shares he earned, in the bomb attacks on London, he was betting to drop this title of half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll let you
"It's like snowballs," he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew about everything or rather.
"When I earned money, they squeezed my eyes."
But then there was a wound at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend at mid-January, he wanted to destroy it.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that he lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
Suspect has become for his vacation.
"I only had four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want someone to look into his records," Kerviel closed.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government have signed a total of nine operational programmes yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the next years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will be headed to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
These money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will be operating with CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to acquire funds for innovative business.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in drawing up of EU funds in the past within the new countries adopted.
Twenty-year-old punishment for the exprezident Nikaragui confirmed the court
The appeal court in Nikaragui on Thursday confirmed the 20-year sentence for the former President of Arnold Aleman, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (free of 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a house prison on his haciende near Nikaragui metropolitan metropolitan.
If the former head of this Central American State from 1997 to 2002 returns to jail, according to the AP Agency, it is not clear at this point.
According to the Board of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on the prison agents whether Aleman will be allowed to serve his punishment at home, or is going to jail.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional, and the accounts belonged in fact to his relatives and the nearest followers.
Some of these money then ended up in the fund that Aleman founded for financing his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
How is this budget special?
It is the first budget set up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He went through this year with the support of the CSSD because the Minister of Saturday and ČSSD couldn't afford his absence.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on disbelief of the government, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The House of Embassy traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, the law approved in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget appropriations, whether anyone likes it or does not like it.
The budget is a major part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the powerful competition of the government with the opposition.
This is more medially grateful, and that is why he has much more attention in the media.
Politicians' fight is much more interesting to the public than steep numbers.
The state budgets in the previous socio- democratic governments suffered three shortcomings that he is not able to solve for 2008 at once:
The first is a high share of the law of compulsory, so-called mandatoral expenditure, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year, before the elections, approved the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and the KSČM.
The other is a deficit management as a result of the first insufficiency.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. city budget deficits and municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It's public and relatively under control.
However, the timed bomb is the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, besides taxes, fees and loans from banks, have received additional investment resources, often unanimously issued bonds that they have unsuitably owed their town halls.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts by selling mass shares of energy and other distribution networks from the state from privatisation.
They don't have this source now.
If we only stick to official and verified facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, as well as the rest of the world, a growth phase, thereby constantly boasting the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to fix public finances.
Instead, the state still owed more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have operated much more reasonable than our Republic.
It's a huge shame that falls primarily in the past government.
We are among the countries that are, globally, at least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have unnecessarily embarked into giant dimensions in recent years.
Even if part of the non-resolute populist spending approved this year before the elections were able to revoke, so if any policy in this country has not been ruled by anyone in the near future will not be able to move the border to retirement and to retirement reform, then any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever is in charge of this will be the only office.
With a small oversight, it can be said that government politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the money taxed to pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolutionary but can only suspend the elimination of normal expenditure by mandate expenses.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments hadn't done what they could in the past ten years.
If we do not really want government politicians to become used officials, then we need to be patient and to allow this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the State can spend only as much as it can on taxes and fees, peace to prepare other reformal laws.
Only those will allow the progressive achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
So more than a hundred billion dollars will get to the monetary markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks advocate a interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the American Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and the next 24 will make access to the European and Swiss central bank.
This is after the attacks of the 11th September for the first time the central banks of each country have agreed to a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to address the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks might lend," wrote in his report to Bernard Baumohl from Economic Outlook Group's advisory company.
"The coordinated actions of central banks reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what else can be followed when they decided for this procedure," said the main economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks have difficult access to loans themselves, they will lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to a recession with potential impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks have thus decided after it failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutually borrowing money, even though the US, Canada and Britain decreased their interest rates several times during autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said Agent Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks will contribute to the crisis as they do not address the basic problem, and that is the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecology Debates are incredible
Global climate change is intended to damage developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus has once again expressed his views on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now ended at the ending UN conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, said that ecological debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organisations, but also a major difference between rhetorics that lead it and reality.
"The debate is completely unstructured there, it's just fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President pointed out in presenting his book that her theme was very important to him, and that is why she is so anxious to them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I only meet caricatures of my opinions many times."
So now the applicants can read his unfrauded attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climateologist, but he believed that he had enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is a academic, able to monitor and assess professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
The main conclusions of the book indicate that the climate is constantly changing, and therefore its changes are normal that there is no consistent opinion of all scientists on the warming of the planet that the consequences of these changes are not too big and therefore are not a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to enforce unproven opinions to others, which feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained on the questions present that it was not against "create environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which did not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver didn't get to trade 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to replace the old driver's license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can ask for a exchange so that the authorities will still be able to issue a new ID by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year, hundreds of drivers would be on the road without valid authorisation.
According to the authorities, they didn't trade a card mainly for those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in the interest of the exchange of drivers, the authorities in metropolitan areas are inflicted and the interest in the exchange of licences has increased this week.
The magistrate takes about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting on the front.
In Prague, the driver's license hasn't changed about 14,000 drivers yet.
It takes 20 days to issue a new license.
However, it may be requested to issue within a short period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay 500 crowns.
The drivers who will not make the mandatory exchange of the licence by the end of the year and go on a road without a valid driver's license will be at risk of fines since January.
The provincial pays a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But the policeman can deal with the offence in an agreement.
In the case of administrative offence, the fine shall be at 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, he could have been fined from the town hall and from the person who wouldn't go anywhere.
It was allegedly possible to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called upon the authorities to be mild and to deposit a fine of not more than a thousand.
According to the spokesman of Karl Hanzelka transportation, the 10,000 fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a proof for which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not an ID that every person has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
You have to take it or send it by post to the competent authorities.
At the end of the year, the licences issued in 1964 to 1993 will cease.
However, engineers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time to exchange.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004, will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court has reduced the punishments to the detectives with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of a crime-related gang of David Berdych, will go to 13 and ten years in prison.
With the definitive effect, the Prague Principal Court decided that thus reduced their punishments, one year and two years.
Originally, it threatened detectives of the Prague Department for the fight against organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision; it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is waiting for the first-instantial verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already been punished in a sum of more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the county court recognised in particular from the participation of 19 guilty robbery, and today the main court dealt with an appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused charges have been rejected since the beginning of the investigation that it was a decorated bail.
According to the Central Chamber, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, inter alia, handed over information to criminals from police sources, covered individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent to Opav and the Horseman.
The prosecution is a criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the robbery whose victims have suffered serious health injury, but also the abuse of the powers of the public activist and unauthorised arms.
The police discovered illegally held guns, steel core shots, laser targeter, or a gun.
The gang's accusation came by robbery to tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost twenty men in this process, the courts have already jurisdictionally recognised the guilty of the other robbery of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men in the vicinity of Berdycha are still in court in another process, some of the bails have not yet passed before the court.
Tomas Půt and Maroshi Šulej, who remained in Irish custody, have been avoided yet, waiting for a definitive decision on their issue to prosecute to the Czech Republic.

For the change of children in the maternity, the lawyer wants the damaged families of Igor Veleba at the third hospital, a compensation of 12 million crowns, plus court expenses.
For every mother of three million, for fathers of two million and for children after a million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital Ondřej He therefore disagrees in principle with the Veleby proposal.
"We reject such a requirement, that is very high," he said, after today's negotiations.
"But if we can make an opinion on this contradiction, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has drawn up.
We'll find out if it's even worth it.
But in the opinion that it will be in the statistics for everyone," he stressed Dostal.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100.000 and 200.000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the bail, the family from Jabloň wanted every month she didn't raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiating a compensation expert opinion, which developed the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole for him.
Parents of children, according to psychology and psychiatry experts, suffered mental injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they were dealing with remorse that they had not prevented the replacing of the newborns.
Women are getting worse with the update of the experience trauma and the contents of Veleba have been summarized with what's happening right now.
Veronica and Nikola traded nurses in a third-country midwife last December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermaks to Przybyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojan to Jabloňov.
Heytman of the Highlands Miloš has handed over each of the families of 10,000 crowns for reimbursement of expenses that have caused them by a misleading thirsty hospital that the country is setting up.
All the hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured from the law for liability for damage.
In the event of doubt, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they may ask for help from the organiser.
The courts have yet granted to people relatively low compensation, the sums counted according to tables in the ranks of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup lost the Valasic kingdom
Puppy Bolek lost a dispute about the brand of the Kingdom of Valas.
According to the Judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, for the first time, he used the name King of Valas, but the project built a long-term work team around Tomáš Harabisz, who worked with the actor.
The soup was not attended today.
According to his lawyer, the bail is probably not over, and the client will appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites at the popularity of Bolka Poupka," said the Polish lawyer after the process.
According to him, all in the words of the Kingdom of Valas are going to get rid of the actor and comedian.
Harabish also has the same opinion.
"There's almost 10 years of work behind us.
Making money and making up the events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful, and he could have some of it.
They want to parasite on our job," he added.
Luxurious business
According to the court, the King of Valas used the Poly in his TV show for the first time.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzorich.
But that was not the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish lost his idea of the issue of Valasian passports.
From the original recession action, trade and lucrative business activities which Harabiš then established by the Kingdom of Valas.
In 1997, the Poles agreed to give their name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts to visit their farm and theatre performances.
Who's used to the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the great idea that the Poly published in a maneuver for his business purpose.
"Popularita Boleslava Soup of the Valas Kingdom project certainly helped," said the judge.
But she added that the souls of the project were Harabiš and his team, who was intensively devoted to him.
Cooperation today was continued by the endangered parties until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation in Vsetin.
Since then, however, they began to gather disputes between the Poly and Harabish, which shouted the seduction of the "Król Boleslav I."
The leadership role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen of the mother.
In 2002, the Poly of Harabish and his company filed a lawsuit that the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabish could bring the throne and half of the princess into the dispute.
He should come out of the new king.
The details and the deadline did not want to reveal yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like a king ride to the Slovack.
The King should be voted for a certain time.
Even Mr. Poles can sign in," Harabisz added.
Peugeotu test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudice
In fact, I've never been much Peugeote 206.
Its characteristics were not much, the quality of ranking, the management, and the production could also be labeled as subdimensional.
But the market is now the successor of Peugeot 207, and that's much better.
And the chamber called the SW is a little further away, and I'm left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeotu 207, I complained, for example, on the head space in the backseat.
That's the end of the complaint here, because the chamber caroserie means that in this direction they won't suffer even two meters long.
Flying the World
I'll go through the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself.
It's a pretty good design, where the only rag I have on the poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design inventory when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backups.
The side line has also significantly improved against model 206.
As far as space, there is a sense of increase in the sizes of the carories.
Then there is already a lack of space above the head in the chamber.
Tanks in the trunk
So the main thing on this car is his luggage.
I have to evaluate that as very well accessible (and also thanks to the glimpse of the rear window) and as a decent storage window.
Deaf places are equipped with restraint rubber, which are an ideal compromise.
They don't, they can spread, and they keep harder objects.
But let's stop over the volume together.
That is according to the table in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is rather an average value against competition.
Not against the Czech most sold car of this class - Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladoleslav product, then we will find that Peugeot remains of a lot of well-known 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or on loading the carriage, this value is critical.
But if I should pick up the positives, I still have to mention a completely straight floor after the backup of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car has been equipped with a 1,6 l-inch-voltage sensor with 88 kW power.
And to tell the truth, that's what a 16-year-old girl should look like that, that's what a family hatchback is.
She's quiet, she's got little consumption, and she's pulling first.
If I compare to her with a badge that makes the leckdy work, like she's got an exhausted cloth, I can only be thrilled to her.
The Principal suggests
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must remember that we have tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with an ignition 14 for CZK 329 900 is still available.
Our aggregation costs $410 900, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium Equipment then brings the equipment for another 80,000 CZK above.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic launch of wirings, electric control of rear windows...
It's just the car costs all over $531 900.
It's a lot, but you'll get the extra equipment at Fabie and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's nothing left to decide for the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils at British schools failed
In British schools, children from Eastern Europe countries are borne, and local residents are concerned about further developments in local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is so far facing a number of obstacles.
The British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original population are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in North Kent, where there are disputes between local habitats and Slovak immigrants.
Thousands, bullies, and fights between pupils also moved into relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police have arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student in Chatham.
The guilty defends her to be insulted by racist abuses.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on the Slovak immigratory.
Men reportedly used racist remarks and throw stones on him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to let it go, he got apple and pears on us, and then he discovered her ass," described another unpleasant event for The Times's mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are both sides.
One of the local residents even referred to disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
These cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between local and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovaks are registered here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then visit British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of Caribbean
For visitors, he's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holidays, that can be done if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or seas, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusives with waiters offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and liquor cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean sea, you can find it in a complete and even richer number.
Only on one island but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba used to be the bass of their acquisition of America.
Columbus has referred it to her as the most beautiful place that has ever seen human eye.
Havana became a warehouse and translation site of treasures that the Spanish in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 20th year.
He had one of the heads of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the USA (in particular for prohibition) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were my.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Hawaii, high-sized houses were driven by cars that belonged to the cultivation symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought his place in San Francisco de Paula, near Hawaii, and he had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, there were signs of the stars of showbusiness and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls in the Havanian Bodeguity you can leave your autograph as well.
In the bar of the expensive hotel Nacional will mix you a cocktail according to your wish.
And the cult cars from the '50s ride hawaii so far, because once imported gigs and purples in that salty and wet shovels are already rotten.
Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is largely perceived, yet nowhere around there is so many beautiful colonial monuments like that.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much necessary money, its development has green.
In the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially on Varader, on the coast of Holguin and on the islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another pound, which is unique in the world and appreciates it especially by trainers.
The thirty of the vast plantings were tied to the canvas on narrow lines of steam and motor trains.
Their car park has not been renewed for many decades, so they are there to see working machines, whose layers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to?
Most visitors in Cuba don't miss the most famous places.
And so about Varader, or Hawan, there's no need to write down too much.
I just hope to remind you that the museum is in the Hemingway family, and who loves this writer, should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales valley in the west of the island.
Poor vegetation grows from the limestone floor.
The mosquitoes, limestone hops and rocks are lifted from the bottom of the valley, and in their caves a fertile land has been captured, thanks to which the vibrant rocks are covered with a dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco grows.
You can meet with his final appearance if you visit one of the havanish factorys for the production of cigars.
Maybe someone's getting interesting about the chili part of Major Zeman was in there.
Trinidad
The ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The glory and wealth brought him a deal with slaves and sugar.
Richness has been transformed into the beauty and exhibitions of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, clearly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain of Escambray, is a place so remote that in the 50s of the last century there was no road that would link the country to the rest of the country.
She was insulation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and that's why it didn't hurt, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach, or the Cucrovar Valley.
The evening is then to go to Casa de la Música, who is living after darkness, and the music in it quiets over the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the east of Cuba is called the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion is certainly influenced by the way itself.
Both roads that run there from Guantanam must overcome the high and particulate mountains and pass through the nature that human activity has almost not seen.
The East East East Cuba recorded UNESCO thanks to its unbreakable nature on the list of world heritage.
They do the best chocolate, in the church have Columbus Cross (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus cruise) and from the hills where the castle stands and today's El Castillo hotel, is seen by several table mountains, of which the most famous is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra's mountain, about the Gulf of Swine and Isla de Pinos, about the Tropican Cabaret, the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about santreia, African religions, who confess the descendants of the former slaves, could all be described a lot of pages.
But, as they say correctly, it's better to see once.
Alliances in Afghanistan are passive, says Americans
Few soldiers and lack of required equipment influence the progress of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to the Minister of Defence, Robert Gates should review a specific plan for the next summer.
The Mission in Afghanistan does not run according to the ideas, agreed in the Scottish Edinburgh leaders of countries with units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the increasing resistance by the Taliban movement, eight participating States are also discussing other plans and coordinating allies.
While the United States, this week through the Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, called on NATO forces for greater activity, the United Kingdom sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the inhabitants to start further economic and security development themselves," said the BBC British Minister of Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent events increased by 27 percent compared to last year, even 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment of units.
In particular, they request additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In the same sense, the Secretary-General of NATO Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I'm not happy about what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," said Agent Reuters De Hoop at the end of three-day interviews with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
There are also disputes between the countries concerned in recent months about whether all all the alliances take the maximum part in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for passivity.
"The Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are planted in areas where the minimum violence and fighting rights are not as high as we are in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British bulb sheet Sun has identified German soldiers as snoops this week.
"Afghans revealed: Germans play while our boys fight," wrote Sun in material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild has gone into an anti-attack and printd a picture of the British Unit in the ragby struggle in the south of Afghanistan.
State debt will be spent on a trillion in 2009
For each Czech Republic, the state debt is over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt has risen at the end of September to CZK 842,7 billion.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry has reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion thanks to better developments in the management of the state budget.
The Czech Republic’s state debt has risen at the end of September to CZK 842,7 billion.
In nine months this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
So today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
A debt of over 84,000 crowns for each Czech Republic.
For the whole year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we could overcome a trillion of crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimír Pikora can see: "To cross one billion, we could get through 2009.
When exactly he will depend on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more money, it could move to 2010.
But I do not expect this change," said.
Debts are rising
State debt constitutes central government debts and is mainly generated by accumulation of state budget deficits.
The State debt is financed by taxpayers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has increased by 1.7 billion crowns this year to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called tradeable state debt at the end of September reached CZK 803,3 billion, and since June it fell by CZK 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of the state debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Total debt for the first to third quarter increased by 13 percent, which is really a lot to how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated for bonds where the rise is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that he'll deal with what he's dealing with when the pension reform is here," commented on Pikor's data.
Better than expected
According to the 2007 State Debt Financing and Management Strategy, the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry has reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion thanks to better developments in the management of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of CZK 91.3 billion expected.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a 10-milliard reserve to pay pensions, the financing of sovereign bonds for 43 billion crowns and the loans from the European Investment Bank of 1,8 billion crowns.
The woman's supposed to come to court today in Chartum for giving her name to the bear
The British teacher, judged in Sudan for the offence of Islam, was sentenced to a 15-day prison court on Thursday night by a Chartúmian tribunal, as her lawyer said.
The British was accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils give the Mohamed bear the name, despite any imaging of the prophet Islam, is forbidden.
She was punished by whip wounds.
This British 40-year-old teacher, acting at the Unity High School in Sudanese Chartum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with the offences of Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils lodged a complaint at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact in September, when the teachers in question ask their six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class bear.
"There are eight names, between them Hasan, Abduláh and Mohamed," says the principal of school Robert Boulos.
After the vote takes place in the class, 20 out of 23 children eventually choose Mohamed as the most popular name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is in Sudan a very widespread Christian name.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description, "My name is Mohamed."
He had no label on himself with this name, but he had difficulty in painting the prophet himself considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' muslims, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that might be offensive for any religious belief: "I regret only that she asked the children to vote for a name", he believes only "innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very careful to their pupils" and add that" nobody in the class talks about religion."
Remind us that the first name of Mohamed is also the second most common Christian name in Great Britain, in English it is written in 14 different ways.
This Christian name often selected by Muslim families represents a way to worship the prophet (sometimes given to the firstborn).
However, what are the rules concerning the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible for example to give them a toy?
Sure, it's a matter of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations, this centre in Vienna has failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Eventually failure.
The Serbian and Cosovians ended the sixth and last round of interviews in the Austrian Baden Wednesday morning, while unable to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement", said the European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the Vienna press conference.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristin to ensure their commitments to peace and were ready for dialogue after the end of the negotiations.
"We are not expecting violence at the moment, but we enter a difficult time", he added that "it is evident that the situation is tense."
The negotiations end on 10 December
The Trinity negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, shall last be headed to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian speaking populations, could appear in a clearer light to 10 December when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to forward their report to the UN Security Council.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and the last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August this year, gave Trojka a new negotiating.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the end of 10 December.
The Russians who have previously blocked Kosovo independence in the UN Security Council insist on continuing the negotiations even after that deadline.
"Russia was and remains adhered to a negotiated, compromise solution", said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of the administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under the supervision of the EU as a single coherent solution.
Prisian declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, independence is ready to declare one-way.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"God, we have failed to reach any agreement," said the president of the Kosovo administration of Fatmir Sejdi at the Baden Hotel, where this "first chance was being negotiated" since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former insurgent commander of the Kosovo Albanians and future Prime Minister of Province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade 'the past that led to murders and deportations'.
"Dominary Effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise is still being taken into account and warned by the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of possible unilateral independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of the war for independence in the 1990s.
"It does not mean that to Serbia," he said, "the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all the decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian allies have a veta right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word."
"For Serbia it is acceptable only solutions from the Security Council," said the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"This meeting took two years.
It must end as she began: at the Security Council's soil."
Fatmir Sedji replied that "the last word on status will have a cossibly parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian people, it would have been "after agreement" with the West.
Bush made an agreement on Israel and Palestinians
During the launch of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, the US President George Bush announced that Israel and Palestinians finally agreed to a joint statement.
He stressed that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmud Abbás agreed to immediately commence negotiations with the intention of once and for all, to solve a 60-year dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush's men, he promised that he would do anything to help them close the "measure contract" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy the "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end with colonial activities, declared Bush and reminded of the obligations for both sides of the "traffic map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House underlined that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Government led by Abbas aimed at "setting a peace contract that would solve all undeclared questions without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three questions which are in the core of the dispute between Israeli and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees extinct in conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's State of Israel.
Abbás took the words after the American President and stressed that the following negotiations were "all and thorough" and that he could touch all aspects of the solution, with mentioning "Jeruzalém, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Then Olmert appeared on the tribune, which expressed the opinion that the following negotiations should be "direct and continual" and that it should be "said to be concluded during 2008".
Bush identified the end of 2008 as the deadline for his "seeing two states", Palestinian and Israel, existing next to himself.
Saudi Arabia said that Bush accepted a commitment in this sense before she decided to attend the conference.
The Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries which Israel offers peace for leaving all Arab territories taken for war in 1967, including eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "survivor in the history of the Middle East, especially because he fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saud in an interview that provided to one of the Arabic speaking diary founded by Saudi capital.
The D.A. says the police don't take responsibility.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As it always happens in such minor reports from the black book, the official versions do not match what is spoken between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police General Inspection (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car passed on Sunday shortly after 17:00 Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle wasn't in the intervention mode, but it was on patrol and it ran at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, and it didn't have side lights on," explains the police source.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to drive public communications" (read below), managed by two young men without helmets, drove "very high speeds".
"The motorcycle ran into a police car from the left after he didn't prefer the right," said a policeman.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew has shown to be negative.
The condition of the car (smashed ancestor, crushed front glass, broken bumpers) indicates the prudence of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givra responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN commissioned the investigation of "indefinitely killing and not providing assistance to persons in danger", which is also taking the direction of départementale de la súreté publique du Val-d'Oise (the Directorate of the Regional Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon of the press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation eliminates, at this stage, the responsibility of the police for the accident.
Three witnesses who were interviewed on Sunday night, according to the officials, confirmed "the police movements, that the minimotor approached them quite quickly from the left".
Some kind of rice, undoubtedly caused by the clips of the ground yesterday, showed that both vehicles were stuck until the police car could stop.
The cars were secured and passed by technical expertise.
A autopsy was performed on both victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel between people, the talk of the fact that the police were supposed to leave the crime scene quickly without giving two young people first aid.
The IGPN had, in all care, to exclude "as serious guilt" at this point.
"It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more search and with whom to be very careful", pointed out the police source.
The "Libération" journal met the eyewitness of the few moments followed by the accident.
One of his windows leads right where the accident happened.
"We are with my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, running down to try to resurrect them," he tells this witness.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw a "clinching, totally frightened policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young people and the fourth spoke on the phone."
In the face of a rapid tension and certainty present that the situation of young people is hopeless, the police were driven by the car of colleagues who had arrived in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the policemen left.
They also performed a heart massage but vain.
"But no one claims that the police didn't make any effort to help young people.
First aid was granted to these young people.
Firemen arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," stressed the D.A.
The tension in Pakistan is growing
The Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the announcement of exceptional state by General Mušaraf, two days ago.
In Lahor, eastern country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken in an exceptional state, the grenades with tear gas were injured, which, according to witnesses, used order forces.
The last names responded to the stones, thereby injured several cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios like Karáčí and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several of them should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, due to a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were replaced by the roadsides on Monday morning, in order to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (Severarywest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers gained the support of religious parties grouped in a politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "bad the population to send flowers to judges who stood against an exceptional state, and garbage to those who made a vow before Musaraf".
"Musharaf's promise doesn't pay."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is a direct target of the emergency measure declared on Saturday night.
In the next days, he had to comment on the legality of the re-election of President Musharaf in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, anti-constitutional, and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," said the official in The News's journal.
The Parvíz Musharfa promise that he will give up military leadership and become a civilian president," he will not pay" after the introduction of an exceptional state, said on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would give up military uniforms until the 15th November when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has otherwise deterred the persisting speculation in the country, according to which the deputy chief of the army had ordered President Mušaraf's home prison.
More than a third of pregnancy still make pregnancy unexpected
This calculation includes unwanted (24%) pregnancy as well as misplanned or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined)- The State Department of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which prevented contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted (24%) pregnancy as well as misplanned or unexpected.
The various methods of contraceptives such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilisation are still 5% to 6% of the failure rate estimates Ined.
The termination of contraceptives only allowed a better "fetal control", argues the Institute and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 years has reached 60% in 1970 today.
Finally, eight births of ten are well planned today.
One couple of five even has the birth calculated for the month precisely and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered to be the most pleasant annual period for the birth of the child.
Remarkable repair of space station
More than seven hours of space work needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to remedy the solar panel, necessary for further scientific activities of the station.
It was a risky exit to the universe, which collected records of the length of duration, distance from the residential modules, the speed with which it was scheduled and the rates of "cutting", which astronauts had made for repair.
Troubles appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from Discovery ship interpreted the Harmony module, a large cylindrical service designed to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is some kind of landing mole for Laboratory modules.
However, it is necessary to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate the seventeen-aheaded module producing electricity through solar panels which were already located at the ISS, so that they would bow at their final station.
After relocating it, the crew started spreading 70 meters of solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels, spreading as a traction harmonic, as a result of the incision of the cable, damaged on the surface without a small meter.
The resolution was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauti, who had originally carried out a control output on Discovery's ship and then go to repair another solar panel whose system of rotation had a disorder, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship, brought to the shoulder of the station, and made a repair.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" of the American Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
High, static, very fragile, has a very worked chest and long arms.
In his 46 years, this original profession was directed by a doctor to "operate" the solar panel.
After he examined the damage in detail, cut off the defective cable and fixed it to damaged places of some kind of "produces".
He helped him with the second "spacewalker" who remained near the compartment, and also from the inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, commander of the crew.
The tools that he used, namely a mini hockey glued with an insulating device to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "after kutilsk" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disassembled and then invented his tools and returned to the internal part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today when seven astronauts return to Discovery's ship to return on Wednesday, as planned, to the Earth.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are spent on the Paris Exchange citedly after the company operating in the air and defence industry announced that it would have to spend EUR 1,2 to 1.4 billion in order to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
The EADS has lost 4% and is now at the Paris Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delays arising from slow progression towards the engine development of the A400M aircraft, which is the condition of the initiating flight.
The price for reducing delays in the deliveries of the military freight aircraft, declared in October, was calculated "in EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent undertaking of the EADS European Designer.
EADS, next Thursday, will be forced to report a new profit outlook before deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT).
The group also stated that the new cost estimate corresponds with a six-month delay.
Remind us that the production results of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, especially due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
The group originally assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft was granted by the French army in October 2009.
Decisions for status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without tense expectations: the Russians will most choose the side of President Putin, United Russia.
In this way, after only a very few free pre-election campaigns, their burden to stability, and to authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Parliament, Russian President Vladimír Putin will communicate to voters on public stations prerequisited television messages, but the content of which is kept secretly.
So it is from the leadership of the United Russia, the Procremell Party, which, apparently, celebrates a vicious victory.
When Ambassadors of foreign states accepted yesterday, the president had nothing to show out of him and satisfied himself with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish the honorable, possibly the most transparent and open-minded choices, elections without the smallest defects on beauty," he added.
There's no way in the eyes of the opposition.
They condemn the campaign recorded by different pressures.
The leader of the communists Gennadij Zjuganov says, "There have never been such a dirty choice or Jelcino."
Following the repression of demonstrations from last weekend, former world champion in Garra Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, according to his lawyer, he still has a prohibition of visiting.
"Russ' mentality remained homo sovietical."
In the background of these simple, tense expectations, two far more open questions are profiled:
- "Who's going to become Putin's successor at the Presidential Office?
The official letter published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can be presented to the public by 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-electioned in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But there is no follower.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be the Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powered sides of the United Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Whether it is, or not, the leaving government will win all over the lines of parliament, as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The ruses remained homo soviet, do not feel the masters of their destiny", believes the sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historic Nikolaj Kopossov of the State University in Sankt-Petierburg notices the time-distance: civil society has acquired, in this country Christianed five centuries after Europe, delays; the famous common spirit has delayed the creation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has established a paternalistic model of the state, the perfectly accepted population, rather, that this new paternalism has not followed terror, but a certain economic well-being," states Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "willingly give up personal responsibility", which they showed shortly after the SSSR collapse.
"Why do you think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total number of 85 Russian leaders) are managed by the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, synonymous of chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, the Russians will not vote extremists.
The conclusion of Tamary Czerdenchenko, the 40th-year-old professor: "Why do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"

For more than 60 years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which have shown fate of 17,5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open to the public.
47 million archival documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have been accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, that means individually and namely, on request of the former victim or of its legitimate persons.
Eleven States entrusted with the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this Agreement is over by all States, the opening has been effective yesterday.
Emergency information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to examine "in particular the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of Red Cross (Comité International de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them, were Germany, against the disclosure of these nominal documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
What are the predicted homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or warrants set up by Gestap were collected after the war for practical purposes to find deported or forced work subjected to civilian citizens, to provide them with proof of their internation in order to open the way of their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent staff in Bad Arolsen are dealing with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"From these papers, no new can be expected," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Centre of Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Today, the bilateral trade between Europe and India is already about €60 billion a year.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting the signing of the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, announced by the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and its Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, the EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs put forward a green European Commission to launch negotiations with a view to signing the Free Trade Agreement (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-Eastern Asia (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India is now about €60 billion a year.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, to the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement has greatly adopted both economies" and "India will gain a better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specified by the European Commissioner. Asian and European gigant together with the exchange of "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services" said this week Danièle Smadja, the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade "not yet reached its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eightth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, for the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosy.

The English Bank took note of the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The English Bank showed on Thursday that he intends to mitigate the current concern that the credit market conditions will be deteriorated again and announced a offer of £10 billion in the five-week auction for the basic interest rate of 5.75%, an unusual long offer.
"At the end of the year, the conditions on the financial markets will be very unfavourable and give banks greater confidence in how to ensure its cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", reported in the communic.
The Bank clarifies that £10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on December 6th, 12th, 15th, GMT until January 10th, at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time that BOE pumps cash on the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
BOE adds in its community that "will remain ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates on a daily basis" of interbank loans at the same level with its basic rate.
The interday interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been settled to 6.6%, which is the highest number since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the English bank related to the fee rates which the banks have deterred from the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations strengthened by the development of the course of libra towards the euro, many have preferred to decide for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) are refusing to deal with socialists' proposals (PS) on buyability
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday a socialist proposal for a buy-out law, which is equal to the refusal of the text.
The text of the draft law was reached at the agenda of the so-called socialist "needs" (initiated by a member club) and contained dozens of measures taken on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, among which the employment premium was 50 % increase, the renewal of fluctuating TIPP, the transport check or the regulation of rent.
Given that the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was terminated after the general debate, which has become an opportunity to exchange views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before the television performance of Nicolas Sarkozy on buying.
The PS Head of MEP Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will reiterate these proposals in their full form in the form of supplements to the amendment of the Finance Act, which will be discussed by the House next week.
New festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is setting up a new festival, this promotor/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey reported in cooperation with the Festival of the British organizer Melvin Benna.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones from the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces a Chicago Festival of Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination campsite.
The festival should take place from August 8 to August 10 at a private farm with 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known under the name of Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most renowned organizers of festivals.
In 1989, the heads of the Reading Festival were held in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people every year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio of Leeds Festival, in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
From 2002 onwards, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also been responsible for production, license and organisational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event" he's ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna work simultaneously to give the region a festival event of European style.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We went with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, we have become politicians because of the current city leadership, delivering Charlie Jones.
"Happy we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn, and we're going to start a great festival in an exceptional place to serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago Grant Park in 2005, after they succeeded in the festival scene by organizing Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are taking place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benna's festival takes place in the country, while our festivals are running more in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to lean both concepts in a certain way to create both the impression of the rural festival in Europe and the city after the ammerick."
Vineland is located approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland County, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed refuses to express the terms of the agreement, however, states that they are sufficiently advantageous to allow investment in such events and to welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, long term.
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which takes 80,000 people.
He says that the invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed at the moment that the program is only published in the press.
"Vineland will have a rock inhalation, but music will be vague in order to attract a wide range of viewers as possible," says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself stands up against it...
This convincing mission is one of the delegates' tasks.
However, his mandate is "politically challenging" because Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall "Guverner" into claws?
"It must be careful, it's a industry that decides where he's going.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will regard as the best," he said.
Festival Honour
However, for this moment, Denise Turcottea is the priority of promoting local film.
The hunt for Oscar has already begun.
At all the festivals of the West Coast, whether these are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about to introduce cuebeque films, to draw attention to them and to ensure that the directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had a good publicity for the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, he will be introduced to the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is in offer in Santa Monica and will be introduced in November at the 30th year Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also introduced four short and four full-time movies at the American Film Institute Festus.
At the end of the year at the maraton storm?
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and the investors already expect me to be a traditional maraton at the end of the year.
But experts are not so sure this year will happen.
Banka Banif believes that "from a statistical point there is a month of December at the exchange a positive course".
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context of markets, at least short-term, certain doubts."
These experts do not assume that the exchange is moving over the last weeks of the year, and they state that "the demolition market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest in due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, particularly solid income affected by the effect of turnover to quality securities, both in long and short seizures".
Therefore, they believe that the stock will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "because there is no known impact of the likely decline in FED rates (Federal reserve system), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflammatory pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI bank sales in Spain, agrees that it's not the right time for a bold statement that a maraton will occur.
"There's no reason to be happy," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15 945,7 points.
Yet all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year by about 16,000 points by regrouping portfolios and traditional pension deposits that occur at this time every year.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, since he believes that maratone will occur earlier, on the second December week following the prolonged weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The analyst mentioned does not think that the volatility would affect market orientation.
Federico Olucha, analyst Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical levels and "so we could observe the reflection of the index, created by the US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree in the selection of titles that will ensure that Ibex be brought to new maximum quotes.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "air is a row on strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
On the other hand, Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco ensures that growth is in hand with banking and industry.
Building companies will also be able to enrich on this maraton if it occurs.
"ACS has been re-established for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be at the top of the year due to increased sales during the Christmas Sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology is also going very well, even if they are not very represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only in two cases a month of falls.
The real marathon was held at the end of 2003 in the administrative year when the storm markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered back 28.17%, December had an increase of 6.68%.
We'll see if 2007 will be in the order of the fifth profit year (for now Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether he can have its maraton at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a great change for the bank.
Also, for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decided to do such a jump and bet on a continuous opening period of its branches up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, which also has several times ensured that it wants to extend the opening period of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, he intends to conclude an agreement with the union on the cancellation of the time of the 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening time at one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience by the Popular Bank will be decisive for other entities to join or not to join this initiative, which supports the opening time of business.
That's exactly the objective of the project that the Popular Bank has chosen.
Get individual clients in these places to be placed behind their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, because it is not an opening of new branches, but only a modification of existing branches.
For this reason, the bank will modernise branches already in its business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
The extension of the opening time is supplemented by another concept of branch space and a new, present design in lighter colours.
The commercial director of the Bank of Ángel River ensures that this restructuring will not constitute a major investment but a greater recruitment of staff, as it is transferred from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with spaces for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel River explains.
Branches were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seemed to be a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2 500 branches.
And another 60 specialised in immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has a very long opening time and opened even on Sundays and on holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when a series of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', says Rivera.
They just agreed with the Telephony to sell their phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubled the value of her rival Antenna 3 for the first time at the storm
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, in his satisfaction at the end of the trade, when he stated that the TV, which is managed, doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I'm sorry is that it didn't happen because we'd grow up more, but because we're less down', he said.
But he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco ended trading by 2.54% yesterday.
This profit has shifted their losses over the past period to 15.66%.
The exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) for the participation of Vocenta (of 13%) is therefore EUR 4,88 million according to the Bloomberg data.
Her competitor Antenna 3, which dropped by 1,52% yesterday and decreased by 40.5% overall since January, is half valued by 2 193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (contributor Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 offers because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do on the same market, at what price, and how we will evaluate it in our observations.
Telecinco announced last week that this year, he was counting on overbundling billions of gross advertising revenues to become the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali assured, Executive President Telecinco and Publiesspaña, branches that provide advertisement of the group.
If the predicted data were actually achieved, this television channel would have seen an increase in the turnover from advertising by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Antenna’s net turnover increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million) while the net income of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the analyst focuses on is the increased pay out for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange: in 2006 this company chaired Alejandro Echevarría among its shareholders 100 % of its profit.
Vasile ensures that, even though it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market in these moments shows some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates of Telecinco, 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because they explain that the expected revenue growth from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009 has stopped.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antena 3, namely 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Ibersecurities: it recommends to purchase both titles mainly on the basis of increased income for dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: better evaluates Telecinco (collect) than Antena 3 (mainten) because of its 'limited priority' and trade growth.

JPMorgan: in both cases it recommends not to overestimate them as it faces 'like threats' (the oversaturated market and the worsening economic environment).
Congress approved MiFID transposing since 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that have been closed today by the Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the draft law, the government has subjected the public hearing of the regulation which develops the new law to both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties consistently raised the efforts of Members and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
MiFID, which regulates the Securities Trade Act, provides for modernisation of financial markets while strengthening the protection of the investor, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial consultancy services for both specialized companies, both natural or legal persons and creates a new type of companies providing financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFIs), which are connected to a company with securities, intermediaries with securities and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of operations with financial instruments is expanded by adding multi-party trade systems and internalisation systems to current stockbrokers to regulated secondary markets.
The law further obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk-settlement methods and requires the reporting of all operations carried out to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the discussion of the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which it is excellent to consider securitised claims to be a "consistent" financial instrument in view of the high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally design the functions that can be established by bachelors in the field of economics and management of the company 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economics.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require an CNMV authorisation and will be able to provide product trading services and customers for various investment firms at the same time.
In November, the harmonised ISC increased by five tens to 4,1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices were developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat policy and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumer Pricing Index but using different statistical modeling methods for estimates of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator was only indicative and therefore does not necessarily have to comply with the final data that comes into knowledge on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
The second Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November ISC increase to 4.1% is a "current figure", but also foretold that the price index would continue to be relatively high in the next months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress's balloons stated that "when it is not a favourable number", the inflation differential of Spain towards the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than last month when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected about 4%," said the Minister of Economy today.
Virgin plans to make money with Northern Rock €42 billion in three years
Since in mid-September, the Northern Rock bank has been in crisis and has had to go to the emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50 % to 12 billion £ (16.8 billion).
The Bank then managed record deposits of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually decreased in two and a half months, even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extends it to the end of the crisis.
Virgin, the name of the entity, which replaces its business brand Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the income deposited to the British banks in the next three years, so as to obtain the remaining £18 billion and thus reach a target of 30 billion.
The Richard Branson Magnate Group, known in the United Kingdom by its prospective advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (as €70 million) per year for advertising and marketing in order to achieve its intention.
The Northern Rock Bank has identified the Virgin Consortium offer this week, which forms three other companies, such as those who prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany is under arrest for alleged corruption practices in construction
The civilian guard was arrested by the current Mayor of Totan (from the People's Party) in early morning due to his alleged involvement in corruption practices in the construction revealed this week.
There was also arrested one of the city hall secretary and the local police chief.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May this year by Juan Morales, the current human Member, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to the investigative sources of the Caden SER TV, could be the head of the entire business.
Police officers continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction committee and do not exclude further arrests in the next hour.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, was accused of the main suspect of corruption practice in the construction that was revealed at the beginning of this week.
As Caden SER informed yesterday, the human lawyer of Mr Juan Morales, who was examined, arrested when leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to the investigative resources, the investigation of Morales’ alleged acquisition of commissions for its signature of the building agreement with the Galicia building company, which has been converted to 200 hectares of land.
Eight persons are being arrested at the moment.
Bono accepted the state's offer in charge of the PSOE's Toledo candidate and, if they win, President of Congress
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luise Rodríguez Zapater in order to stand in the next general elections in the chair of the PSOE candidate paper (Spanish Socialist Party) in Toledo and in the event that socialists win general elections, he became President of the Congress.
So at the press conference, the secretary of the PSOE for the organisation of José Blanco and himself Bono, after the meeting with Zapater, which took place at the federal office of the party today.
The chief of the exekute offer to the former minister justified that in political life, "it's important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He also pointed out that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party at the President of Congress if socialists will win in the next elections.
As President of Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision on 15 November not to run in the next general elections and leave his active political career so that he could focus on combating climate change in university education.
The former Minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly insisted on him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He also stated that as well as citizens know who will be Deputy Minister of Economy, if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will chair the Congress.
If Bono gains this function, he hopes that the House will transform into "the House of Respect and not the enthusiasm or screaming" and will ensure that "he will become more like the citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid, where you can't be calm, and the peace to speak is Congress, the chairman of the Senate government, on one occasion, has interrupted 26 times."
He also expressed praises at the address of the current President Manuel Marin and "his good work," and did not want to imagine himself in his position so that he did not lower himself to what his opponents could consider as "a greatness".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement of climate change is subject to misleading persecution, both those who view sceptically on his predictions, and those who prefer other political and social struggles, must demonstrate a strong coherence.
In addition, to have a leader of a movement that is the Prime Minister of Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activities or the ineffectiveness of his government have made a significant contribution to Spain leading in the European Union to the non-compliance of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance in which sectors are happening and why his government, the government of the contract, has not prevented it.
In addition, it forces him to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to prevent climate change.
Which firms will be damaged by which habits of the population will have to be altered, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't expect such explanations, we won't be able to wait.
Just because we need to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of petrol, the proposed PSOE (Spanish Socialist Party), seemed to Zapater so risky in terms of elections that he had stepped up to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't stand, purely propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the covenants of the planet; this master is so useful for the election campaign, who does not speak, does not require anything, but is an ornament of the possessions and encourages them.
If it is limited to being only a virtual contract party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool with a fan.
Mayor and Chief of Local Police arrested Totany for suspicion of corruption practices in construction
As they informed the investigative resources, the Civil Guard arrested the Mayor of Totan, the "hudden" of José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in the hospital for suspicion of committing crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, where he is now located together with a number of police officers who also joined the Commission for the construction and urban business for industrial land management and apartments.
This three arrests came to six, which took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to retraining more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that Nuaria's galicia could build 4,000 homes after the payment of illegal commissions during the last election period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged in a short trial in the court of Totan's first instance.
Six first arrests were brought to court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana is being investigated and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of the realtor's office, registered today in Totana and his current girlfriend who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Province Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., Director of Suelo de Inmonuar, who belongs to the group and who were transferred bribes.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of criminal offences in the construction of the CMC, whose members, besides arrest, have also carried out eleven tours, mostly in the companies related to arrested, located in Madrid, Vigu, Murcii, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Province Madrid) and Totana.
There was only one person trapped in Totana in the area of a very well-known owner of the company's poultrymeat products, which could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the position of the largest residence complex of Totany Murcia, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 homes, golf courses and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of soil in Totana, which was rearranged and its project was intended to double the settlement of the village with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Group of Nuaria constitutes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the market for real estate, Conycase, which operates parking in Coruňa streets, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of construction elements.
It happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on 18 November, on the same day that the critique of Blackburn's book appeared on the same occasion:
"The scope of the subject of philosophy penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokel's city.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the counsellor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded from the Helsingin Sanomat daily to take critical opinions on Platon and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory course of philosophy in high schools."

One colleague shall inform the introduction of a criminal offence from the Internet into the criminal code:
A. Staging one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you shut down the board at a price of less than EUR 400 in the store, this is considered to be just an offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you cross up to EUR 1,000 in the shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for downloading (§ 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for download (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in fights than exchanges of complications.
Participation in disruption is at a rate between three months and one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of complications would be a rate of six months to two years
(§ 270 Criminal Code).
E. The sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious in accordance with § 184.2 of the criminal code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyright-protected films is vice-criminal than the provision of porn materials to a juvenile (§ 186).
So if my colleague isn't wrong, someone's hand was pounding off, and that's right.

My nurse is putting me in one of his articles about strange research called "the money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that make a monthly payment for employees depend on how much colleagues make.
The research was carried out at Bonn University using magnetic resonances on the tomography and results are published in the last number of Science magazines.
According to Bernda Weber, the author of the study and the head of the Group Views of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly."
Researchers observed that when both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one received doubles, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion requires so much science.
The applicant of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been chasing lamely for eight years from the State Prosecutor of the Court of Justice in Hague for the Balkan War.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, since the main vineyards of the Srebrenica Massacre, where 8,000 bosen Muslims, former General Ratko Mladič, and former leader of the Bosenian Serbs Radovan Karadžič, are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list from which the title of the documentary film was taken by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin list" (2006, not introduced in Spain), which, at the rate of the detective thriller, watches from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in prosecuting refugee criminals and pressure on the relevant states to pull the network.
What kind of insurance is suitable for me?
The insurance of a car that protects drivers in the event of an accident represents a significant expenditure that depends on different factors such as age, condition, gender, driving licence length, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Selecting suitable car insurance is even more difficult than selecting a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between insurance and insurance.
This undertaking takes into account the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive a agreed insurance amount of a certain amount for taking charge of the payment of damage in the event of an insurance event.
The insurance shall be the price of the insurance which shall be determined with regard to different factors such as age, condition, gender, driving licence length, type of vehicle which is insured or used, etc.
The insurance companies determine their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the likelihood of a crash is, the higher the insurance rate is.
For this reason, both persons aged 25 and women must pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, insurance companies have come to the conclusion that people living in marriage have less accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of the rides, thus on the likelihood of having an accident.
The growth of the frequency of the ride increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when they determine the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must examine the situation in order to choose such insurance that is best suited to its insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for selecting this or that type of insurance which, besides that he will benefit from the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under 25 years of age face various disadvantages such as low driving experience and short possession of a driver's licence when they want to negotiate insurance at the price available.
Although the insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cost-effective drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would assume the customer’s participation in the payment of an insurance event.
"The number of insurance payments provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the insurance price which will be higher, the higher participation would be," explains Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other operating participants, so that the client is insured against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would have been insured against theft, the fire and the loss of the vehicle.
Recommended.
If you are younger than twenty-five years old, try to be careful and prevent accidents as possible because it affects your bonus and will reduce your insurance in the future.
The Bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, Malus is an increase in the base rate.
"Bonus and Malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, she will be able to afford to increase the bonus," explains Noguer.
After crossing the border of twenty-five years it is easier for drivers to negotiate insurance because the customer's risk index is reduced, thanks to acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of pre-experienced experience at the moment of an accident, and even in the management process", assures the Director of the European Society in Spain and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure when the "frequency fear" has already been overcome.
However, if a client is married, but has no children yet, it is better to set up insurance against all risks, provided that his economic situation permits it.
The families with children are considered to be a clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their inclinations will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against any risk with a discount (which could be EUR 300) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other operating participants, starting with a third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is more peaceful and their buying capacity is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount," says Luis Noguer.
It is recommended that insurance against all risks with a discount of EUR 150 or an insurance extended to other operating participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that the insurance of the car is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a valid reason for the proper examination of the possibility of insurance that would suit us most due to our personal situation.
Celtic trying to get to AC Milan point which means eight-final
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to obtain a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, because it would mean that for Italy it would be the first and that would decide the location of Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth match of the draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to make sure that the Schchťor is not getting in front of him with six points that will play with Benfika, which has four.
These two games of group D will be played a week before the sixth round ends, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the 13th in the semifinal, in an attempt to go to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and indeterminate result on the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most probable, even though both men try to find a victory because the Italians won't want to tattise on the domestic soil and Celtic knows that after the winner he would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's man could have had enough to progress even if Shachtior didn't win, but he can't rely on it, because in the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) but won in the first direct game (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening to Scots who believe that they will get to the second semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same game in the last game goal Kaka in extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 at the basic game time.
Hopefully they win the "rossoneri" will be the Shachtior, for which it is worth winning, only if Celtic loses, both for the procedure to the eight-final, and for the stay in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no possibility to continue the highest European competition, could one victory reach a third place, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour attended 20,000 people in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls Group began in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 viewers had first tour since she broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver declared that the reconnection of their group was "great".
Approximately 20,000 people bought tickets so they could be present in a concert, which also included videos that indicate the history of this group, which caused sensation by the end of the 1990s.
The return and world tours take place at the same time as the new album, which is issued by EMI in Spain, and which brings a selection of their main successful compositions, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated bracelets that the husband gave them "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded the GM Place, although the nervous Victoria forbids it a few days ago.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't even see our costumes, so I'm nervous about what they're thinking about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "for contradictions between us" caused two years later the dissolution of the five-member group, also demonstrated its nerve in meeting with the journalist two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw the world's public opinion changed, the opinion of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I decided," said Chisholm about the reconnection of the group she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that, in the course of time, "the things have been settled and we're all very fond of each other."
However, a lot of things have changed since the last time Spice Girls came together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to TV CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with the Virgin Airlines special.
At the arrival of the airport, the nanny army was expected.
Five has seven children in total.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
It will be released on December 23th in Madrid.
Fears of the new gas fight between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the price of natural gas and there is increasing the risk of the Russian supply of this fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is led by pipes across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is being closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow would raise the gas prices to Ukraine, Russia would charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year has reduced deliveries to the EU States.
The latest dispute between Kyev and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian State owned by gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that it will have to charge Ukraine more, because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas that he receives from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that it could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries during the negotiations," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatolij Kinach.
"Gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments relating to the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in the supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a stubborn fall of exports to Western Europe, which increased the prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but the large part remains insufficiently used.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said that the NHS Scottish Chamber must improve the control of criminal records for non-European employees.
The recommendation from President of the High Office of Robert Black came after the foreign doctor in Scotland was connected to the June attacks on the Glasgow airport.
Mr. Black is also afraid that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign staff that he employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were carried out in order on the sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority was concerned immediately after the June attacks on the Glasgow airport on personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
The eighteen-year-old Bilal Abdullah, Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone drove Jeep to the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of connection to attempted bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK prior to its employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to control criminal records, this Agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
The President of the Supervisory Authority report states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be led by the Criminal Records Bureau Directives, which help employers with checks in several countries.
"But we found that part of the staff's records contained evidence of these checks are not regularly carried out," said the report.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS in many terms agrees with its own pre-employment clearance policy, but also added: "Our report draws attention to the areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information about the amount of foreign staff."
Prime Minister BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and is not clear what additional value they will bring," he said.
The Scottish Health Offices have announced that at present they have 1 161 foreign workers, most of which are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supervisory Authority pointed out that these numbers would probably also be higher because the Commission had the problem with identifying personnel with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, working permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently recasting the policy and pre-employment control directive for NHS foreign workers.
Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on the Glasgow airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in accordance with the health committees, considers the recommendations of this report and ensures that the best procedures appear in the updated pre-employment checks of all staff - including the foreign - planned issue next month.
Joy Division controlled the movie prices
Control, a biography film of the late singer Joy Division Ianu Curtis, collecting five prizes for the British Independent Film Awards, including the best movie prices.
The prizes also won the star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the next role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was appointed the best actress for thriller Records about the scandal.
And the star of the bonds Daniel Craig won Varieta's award for getting a British film on the world scene.
The prices were presented solemnly in the London Roundhouse.

This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost only 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known by the iconic packaging of the album U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for the best director and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award - for Julien Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the prize for the best documentary.
The cookie for the best actor has won Viggo Mortensen as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in London's thriller David Cronenberg Eastern support.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard men, won Richard Harris' prize for the extraordinary benefit of the British film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, are currently filming another piece of Indian Jones - Kingdom crystal skulls.
Winston said he's proud of this award, which is named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened a door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Bify, are awarded by jurys, in which filmmakers, actors and organizers of the festival.
Bif's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for a terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that she arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as on spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to put missiles in the country.
Al-Qaeda’s sympathizers have led a campaign against the monarchy, the allies of the United States, since 2003 from invasion to Iraq.
The TV report announced that the cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia builds a unit of rapid reaction of the strength of 35,000 members to defend the device from the unsuperfected al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing factory in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the Home Statement of the Ministry: 18 arrested were the cells led by the "expert to launch missiles" that slipped into the country.
She also stated that the militants were planning to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
22 captives were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government encouraged the spiritual government to try more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join Al-Qaida militants fighting the allied troops and the Shield government supported by the US, which the Conservative Sunni Sauds view as heretic.
The Al-Qaidian militants believe that the authorities cooped many spirituals in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of the leader of Al-Qaeda Saúda Osama bin Ladena - focused on the proseque saudian government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war was an enormous effort of security forces in the past... five months," said the inner ministerial spokesman of state television.
The 16-media cell in Medina was also arrested, which aimed at promoting the "tactrisian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims identified as unbelievers and waste.
Among the under arrest were also 32 people accused of granting financial support to the militants.
The climate in Venus may be a view of the future Earth
The scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a nice place for life.
Data from the circular European stations show that the planet is even more similar to its head twin Earth than it was thought before.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of Earth.
These two worlds are roughly equally large and circumstantial in similar ways, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, there were conditions similar to those on Earth and could also be resident.
But the spilled greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus after a completely different path of development.
Today, there's a planet without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to pouring lead, and it's deserted by storms and winds of the strength of the hurricane.
The findings from the probe of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet one year, offer an alternate view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Oxford University physics Department and one of Venus Express's heads said: "It's getting more clear why the climate in Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are differently similar.
"Our new data enables us to build a script in which Venus began just as Earth, perhaps even with the residential environment, billions of years ago."
The police arrested "a rich uranium"
Kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was arrested by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police spokesman said that three people were detained and the material is being investigated.
He did not confirm that this was an enriched uranium, but he said that this substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Still encroached
Mitt Romney said that there is no dignity for the presidential candidates to answer questions from the snowman.
Despite that, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed to the YouTube debate in which the ordinary voters recorded their video questions and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions sent on Wednesday, 28 November were as comic as the snowman, who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate on the other side of YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many on the status of the Republican Party towards elections in the next year.
It is unclear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, were picking up videos that were shown to assist candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to one subject, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest Republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of undeclared voters to turn around when they heard something comforting: the voter recorded the peaks of consent when the candidates talked about a hard approach at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of opinions occurred between Rudy Giulianim, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who was ahead of the key votes in Iowa and New Hampshir.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to lose the reputation of a man who was soft as the Prime Minister of New York on an illegal immigration.
He attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
These two were particularly ruthless when the Taliban asked if one of the candidates would support "amnestia" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and a possibility of citizenship).
Adverse candidates, like Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the Congressman of Colorada, were able to bring their little mill to this subject.
None of these two have a chance to nominate, but they're both in the game, perhaps for they've started to be on alerts because of immigration earlier and stronger than others.
At least, the candidates have some similar opinions: greater stringency at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, together with the fears of poisonous toys from China and other concerns about the surrounding world, helps the Republicans forget or minimise the disparities between liberty and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when there was other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why in the past he supported the arms holding.
John McCain and Mr Romney were discussing whether simultaneous heating techniques should be considered torture.
One taler asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani concluded through it that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe literally the story of Jonah and whale.
Another taiser asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - which is now against all the assumptions at first in the recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long - Christian conservative - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to run for himself, thus earning his laughter.
The fight remains extraordinaryly open.
Mr. Huckabee's growth in Iowa is covered with recent successes in obtaining money and joyful Ron Paul during the Wednesday debate.
These two have bounced from the bottom, because both wings of the party still cannot agree to more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the winning report on the American size on the lips, winking on both wings of the party.
This time the side is broken and the result is far away.
Labourists’ pain
Gordon Brown found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it's a custom for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
It doesn't seem like some orders were sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extra-management fingers were occupied.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would go around without being discovered that some rich businessman for four years masked the contributions of the governmental Labour Party of £650,000 (1.3 million) under the names of other people and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the call for elections and offended the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by the surveys, there was a hope that it would ensure a resistant and effective government.
Instead of making it more funny, who represented the Prime Minister of Liberal Democrats, Mr. Brown once turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Unburdened rescue of the Northern Rock Problem Bank has shown weaknesses in driving and a lame judgment under fire.
The poorly thought proposals for a change in the tax legislation have combined companies against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed an unpredictable administrative obstacle.
The three of the generals retired to start a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, because they claimed to be the commander of armed forces is a part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and their former inner guardian), has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown's going to his end in no way.
Despite the governments, they can reach a point of translocation that they find heavy rulership.
People don't trust politicians and don't like them, but most of the time they don't trust them if they take over a new group.
Now that it seems clear that some Prime Minister probably doesn't improve anything, and it doesn't even have to be in the office for a long time, it's a dismantling: the state administration becomes a hole, the ministers will start to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unsustained and defensive.
In one direction, Mr. Brown's position is particularly complex, because against other political leaders he can't take the position of a new broom.
As much as he'd like to distancate from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the Financial Office are linked to the decisions that Mr. Brown has done as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in blair's shortcomings, such as a long investigation into financing political parties due to the 'fair for money', voters may be able to believe he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's distress is not as bad as they look.
These oversights aren't as terrible as conservatives do them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one died or was deceived.
And treatment, however painful, is to provide what the stalinist tendency of Mr. Brown has always promised: a reliable, firm and lightly brutal government.
The latest start around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid, Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he did not wish for his charity any publicity.
It may be true, but it wasn't his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of the great political donors are clear and there are for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams' procedure, but he didn't know he was illegal, will be sure to be thoroughly questioned; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief worker of the money that learned about the misleading gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not yet involved; there is nothing that suggests he knew about these skins, even though the main part of the payments took place after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half his work.
Very quickly condemned this infringement by his own party, but he redeemed his decisiveness by reaching after the successful instrument, the Commission for the examination of this matter - led by an additional bishop in retirement and judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of police.
Moreover, there are also other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one for six months, and proceeding with a genuine reform of political funding.
This would require workers who are in close position to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The conservatives now have a good lead in the surveys; he has two years to regain the voters; and the only way to cheat the victory is inviolable integrity and high competence.
Carrot sharks
Does the crisis affect undercutting US credit card market mortgages?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, they get excited to have cereal spits.
Now that the American real estate market is bruised, the predators focused on the other credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analysts say that loss on credit cards would be if other options of consumer credits were infected from subordinated mortgages could reach $99 billion.
The tension marks are clear.
The number of cases of incapacity to repay (at more than 30 days of payment delay) and of the debited accounts (the accounts which the provider considers to be indefinitely).
HSBC announced last month that $1.4 billion lost on the American consumer credit market - also because of insolvent credit card loans.
But it's still early for panic.
The accounts and the inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody's assessment agency, 3.89% of the level of insolvency in the third quarter was almost the whole percentage point below the average.
Deterioration rates can be partially explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US personal bankruptcy Acts from 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that make a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciations) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general terms for borrowers have been deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good level of maturity which shows how many consumers will pay monthly on their debts.
And trust in credit cards secured is firm, despite paralysis in other parts of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney from the Tower Group research company predicts that the volumes of their emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways for the spread of infections between the crisis of underline mortgages and the credit card market definitely exist: when the property loans are dry, consumers are rather owed through credit cards.
However, credit card issuers are rather looking at cash flows than the value of the guarantor's items, so the falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They can even be advantageous to the lease provider.
Consumer motivation to pay mortgages decreases when their assets fall below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on cards moves up to the list of priorities to repay.
Card issuers can also react faster and more flexiblely to stormier conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid change in the price of guarantor items.
"It won't be that one beautiful morning we'd just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Even if the risk of explosion in the style of underline mortgages is low, the risk of gradually weakening is far more realistic.
If the lower prices of homes and debt reductions push America into a recession, the credit cards sector will stand before the darker future.
Watch out for the cereal spits.
British bankers admitted the guilt in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be judged for their roles in fraud related to the former financial leader of Enron Andrew Fastowe, changed their statements and admitted guilt in the middle.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty of seven fraud charges, where they were supposed to participate in financial fraud in the year 2000 -- enrich themselves on the account of their employers -- they denied.
They were supposed to stand before the court in January.
However, during the trial before the American district judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC units, was based on the front page for two years, which lasted the issue procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unopened parts of the Enrone investigation started in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 pointed out that Mr. Fastowa was the target of a government investigation on Enrone's bankruptcy.
Prosecution against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to deceive fraud together with Fastowe and his former major associate Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in the partner branch of Enron controlled by Fastowe, which was an architect of a lot of enrone fraud that took Enron after spirals towards the opening of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this branch by zero, but our three British knew that it was really worth it.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper for a share in this company of $250,000.
According to Fastow's defendant, Enron deceived that the energy company would pay for his share in this Greenwich NatWest 20 million dollars.
However, 20 million were actually the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers got $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others made up about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted the guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in Enron’s collapse.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently under a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in charge of the sentence of three years and one month at the facility in Texarkana.
All three British were free to bail $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after the years of accounting tricks could no longer be able to hide billions of debts or show a failing speculation as profitable.
Over 60 billion dollars of market value and more than 2 billion dollars in pension insurance have been canceled by the collapse of thousands of jobs.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former head of staff Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the fall of society.
Skilling is in charge of more than twenty-four years of punishment.
The judgments over Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow’s Insecurity
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine, and with sufficient fuel volume for nonstop years from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
However, for some of the Russian rich, it is a small return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Deputy Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Milionary Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of proven consumption in the mamuth exhibition center on the main city periphery.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other suppliers of luxury have built their stands, hoping that freshly rich Russians will draw on everything from the mahagonal yachts to diamonds decorated to cars for which they would not be ashamed of even 50 Centes.
Mr. Firer looked carefully after the bright orange Porsche at the next stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's against us fives and tens," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
On oil waves, money goes to the Russian capital just as much as it was when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the '80s, when some Americans enriched and dragged to Europe, where they looked at as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listener of the fourth year in Davis's centre of Russian and Euroasian studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi scatters from the '70s and the Japanese in the '90s, the Russians become the most prominent spenders of the world.
The exclusive brands are looking for their part on this Clondique.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry of Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian.
(The International Herald Tribune is organized by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has, according to the list of richest people, the Forbes magazine of 53 billionaires with total names of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the local Central Institute for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "secondary" millionaires in Russia whose property in the sum gives $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that 15,8% of the Russians lived below the limit of the existential minima in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we all are here," said Nicole Marais, the sales and marketing representative of the London jewelry David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly prepared, and men are all for a fortune."
When they were walking in the evening dresses on Sunday night halls, the 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five-year-old Star Lightlana Turovcov named themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars, and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatov, who blew into the branded dress as a veteran of red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home puppy.
The trade fair seemed to be focused mainly on fresh riches, markedly controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit out a few hours in road traffic so that they could pass through the warehouse which screamingly mixes Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream Mövenpick, round tables in peace, apartments in Dubai, Gund and passage.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the Dutch porcelain manufacturer of porcelain Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's image from hand- painted blue tiles in overlife size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gold."
Indeed, here's sellers say that the Russians with old money (according to Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have moved from the flash logs to a few known brands of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaire messengers, or simple tourists, swamped the fairy halls the day.
And some of them bought.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of the King Koil bed, said that he sold two matttress sets of silk, cough and cotton, coated with gold threads, after 70,000 dollars.
Also, the first day said Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, which features high-end cars with high-end alarms, that his company sold clear orange Porsche for $170,000 to the Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon Andrej Karapetian, President of the L.A. Connection, who, on request, adjusts luxury cars, sold three bars into cars in the style of connected string bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoma after 55,000 dollars.
He showed the reporter the wheel of the car designed for the Russian owner of the casino, which had the exhausted Swarov crystals so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four.
"This Russian millionaire, who wants a bicycle from a peeling skin or a portrait of his wife from the crystal zirkonia, doesn't have to ride on those bikes yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage by 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing too exclusive, given the great increase in the prices of the property here.
"If you bought a flat three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably already millionaire, at least on paper, when not in cash," he said.
"There's more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand operated by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has set up four red phone booths of British style dumped column of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said that his team was printed for the Millionaire Fair of 500,000 fake banknotes.
The fellows stopped to scatter around a pile of money, or to let their friends take a picture of their mobile phones, resting in the middle of their wealth, or they just dumped out a few million.
"You know, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey, possibly caused by a corrupt operation.
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant here About something healthier and watched an ambulance that came to a white Newangly House of two houses, two houses from West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police patrol got in the car.
And another one.
"I saw the delivery of a medical examiner coming," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, executive assistant to the director of the Newar police department.
Now, the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of the procedure performed by a non-licensed plastic surgeon whose identity she refused to provide who worked at the house 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and hoped that the toxicological tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, would help solve a mysterious death that sent a wave of sorrow through the Newarian Police's leadership.
Miss Arroy was an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the departments.
"She was loyal, tough and hard working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy on the phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, the former Newarchy policeman, who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that she leaves two sons at age 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson of the Union District, Theodora J. Romankowa, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy died of the consequences of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one option," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. at 21 p.m.
November, and they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if Miss Castr's offices were listening.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castr's house, with a ruined pink bushe in the front garden and Dalmatine barking back, no one answered
Aside from the doors that led to the basement, he was trapped in an open garage with a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On the hooks on the one hand, there were two mountain bikes.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York Police Department for 25 years in New York, Miss Arroy gave him an invaluable help to bite into a hateful and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, "You should be careful of this or this," he said.
"She was here every time I came, and she was here every time I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed reduces interest rates leads to strengthening the world's storms
The prices of shares on both sides of the Atlantic have fallen yesterday after the market's hope that the Federal Bank will try to calm the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates have been strengthened by the calming statements by the vice-presidents of the American Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line with Ben Bernank, President Fed, said that in response to the continuing pressure on the financial markets, the managers must be "flexibil and pragmatic".
In an obvious effort to calm the irritated markets in the midst of signs of rebirth, Mr Kohn said that the recent revolts " partly revoked some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October".
Furthermore, it stated that if increased instability continues, the possibility of further deterioration in households and companies will increase.
Investors consider these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to add additional fresh capital benefits to the US markets, and perhaps further reductions in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These notes also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed a record-low numbers.
The consequences of financial beliefs were undermined by the notification of Bear Stearns' investment bank that would cancel 650 jobs, which are 4% of its global labour force, in the context of the reduction of costs due to the compensation of the heavy losses caused by the non-performing housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these locations are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1 500 people.
In New York, the industrial index of Dow Jones grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13 289,40, while the more used index S&P 500 strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London index FTSE 100 strengthened by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6 306.2, with the British blue-chips value increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 strengthened by 2.2%.
Some time ago, the credit tension in the markets showed full force after the loan of the three-month monetary packages of the European Central Bank was loaned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, which is most since April 2001.
The pressure on the English bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release overstandard money to the London cash markets has increased, with the rates of the three-month British inter-bank loans "Libor" appeared after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum from the end of September to 6,59 percent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemma, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's going to be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, nothing less relevant than the first Sri Lance Test, who's to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the Chairman of the Commission, who is held at this post at the best in leased time, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and because the Hugh Morris, the head manager of the English team, begins to fill the application for the national collector's post, not necessarily for full time.
Whoever will not be built on the sixth bat will be unhappy, but life often is not fair and sports no longer.
It's not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets through a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of happiness rather than abilities.
Not only in cricket is a selection of challenging and requires an assessment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it a good time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah if it is?
The same could be asked in other areas, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and expert reviews, should be promoted to the committee - the place is only for one.
Who's supposed to say what level is right for crickets if he can't get a chance to drop or swim on another one?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on deciding, but they still have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketman must catch the view of the captain at the right time, if he's supposed to take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances of starting positions, if he's ever supposed to make the impression as a one-day cricket.
Getting a look at the collector is more complicated.
For example, in the last season, there were many better ones that James Anderson, whose place in the first test, seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and thrown as an artillery.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class at 33 rounds for everyone.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same fine average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for another.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or drive both careers, or also may not have a great influence.
Four years ago at Srí Lance, Gareth Batty played in every test and in the first class, he served good performances, five wickets and 40 holidays, but he was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketary, which is also, although he recorded twice a hundred points in Australia, he might still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training purely on Asirgiya stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience before Bopar's youth.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks his sparkly and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class compared to the six Bopars, which is, in twenty-two years, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin overhozes.
However, Shah did in two shifts in May against the Caribbean at the Lord's Test, his home field in Middlesex, just ten crossings, and that, together with the immediate refusal of the collectors, when Vaughan wanted to reattach him at the next match, his launch seems to be taken away from an elan, which was so obvious in Bombay.
On the other hand, the Essex University has joie de vivre in bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket field, and his behavior outside the playground symbolizes a recently reversed car with a hook on four wheels on the exhibition day of the automobile sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He ran out with light injuries and apparently shocked, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (such as sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his fellow player, who would slowly watch it to ask him excitely, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is certainly better in the field, its medium-speed loops on the playgrounds that seem to be good for him, handing out effectively and exploding self-consciously and skillfully.
Choose the right person is one thing to choose the right time is different.
Maybe it's the actual selection art.
Personally, I knew to get Bopara his chance now, which, of course, I don't want to say, Shah won't excellate if, as the Cyclon tea tickets suggest, he'll be the one who's playing here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to come to Baghdad yesterday and to scatter the refugees who had come out of money or expired the visa validity, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some have even come back to fight armed men who have driven them out of their homes.
The Mansurian bus station was before 800 people arrived in the official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned privately by transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, a Sunni doctor.
"Tonight I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the paper because of what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that the Mahdian army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shipian Military of the militant spiritual Muktad Al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to break the fight.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eight-year-old Shield teacher from mainly the Sunni region of Amaría, returned with his two children, because he could no longer restore the Syrian visa and because the regime there was not allowed Iraqis to work.
His Shield Neighbors in Amaríi called him with the fact that the local homework with the support of the American army helped to push al-Kaid out of its positions in the west of the capital, and they insisted that he return.
One of the newly arriveds from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad, drove out a grenate attack after he insisted on his fellow citizens to rise against Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"The last few friends called me and told me that he's driving a militia against al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that he needs me and support my boys.
That's why I came back today," Sabaah Ala Obeidi said.
Many were talking about the attractiveness of calming in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and the growth of local "groups of susceptible citizens", which by the side of the American army defends its quarter.
But more was talking about the fact that they had caused obstruction around the visa and the loss of money in Damaszek, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the one-first father of three children, voiced the suspicion shared between refugees, that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to set limits on refugees visas and to bring them back.
According to the data available, more than two and a half million people escaped from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before Al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left."
Partial reason for weakening violence is the fact that sunnites have been pushed out of the scattered areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that the sudden tide of refugees will blow the sectarian tension again and lead to another fight.
Small Sarah, good education
Germany’s smallest societal country plays a leading role in vocational education, excels even in international focus on its universities.
Only in one educational area Sarah is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"The man who does not come from Sara yesterday, I explained that we are not French" - this self-ironic password appears in Sarah on posters at the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest social country.
However, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Syrian education system, which is in the monitoring of the Cologne Economic Research Institute (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have already traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was established in 1948 by French.
Today, students here can end their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
It corresponds to a reasonablely high share of foreign students, which is 15,6 %.
After all, the overprimary number of sarah children is accepted at college - many of them without a gymnasium.
"In Syria, a professional education system is used", says Axel Plünnecke, IW educational expert.
By obtaining more than every fifth young man's permission to study at a professional school, Sarah is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich options in Sarah to combine practical and academic education.
The options to study two areas are given the number of populations of the second best in Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, in recent years, the number of graduates of engineering has decreased by a third.
That is why the Sarian Ministry of Education has now ordered high schools to create a promotional campaign on engineering areas.
"After the first study of Pisa, we did several reforms in general educational schools," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore carried out comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order to begin learning as soon as possible, the last year of maternity schools are free - a model that takes over other societal countries.
If the results of the pupils are significantly improved, they'll show up to the future comparative study.
During the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 %.
Totally, Sársko did not improve as much as other societal countries.
The bachelor can count better.
And to disappoint Sarah's studies of Pisa do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarah could be pointing in this area.
The language of the neighbors is obligatory in the gymnasium, even though the inhabitants of Sarah are not French.
Chase shifting hours
Soon they'll be in Venezuela's hours different than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will have hours to move back in this South American country.
In Spain, in the meantime, it becomes a ridiculous figure.
The official letter, Venezuela, informed that the clocks, according to the new law, would move by negative four and a half hours.
The South American State will be this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Understand, the enemy of the US justified his decision, among other things, by compelled the United States to divide the world with time zones throughout the hours.
Moreover, on the Wednesday of the local time, Chávez announced that, because of the case with the hostages, relations with neighboring Colombia are interrupted.
This left-handed nationalist said that as long as Alvaro Uribe is conservative, President of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with the Colombian government.
"I can't, because of my self-respect," said Chávez, who promotes the reform of the constitution that the citizens of this oil country must vote in the Sunday referendum.
This reform would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The argument has caused Uribe's decision to take away Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
He criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone here caused a start: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you silent anymore?) - that sounds like a sentence that more than half a million people have withdrawn from the internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent ibero-American Summit, expressed its speech on this left-handed populist, was so upset that he shut him up in this way.
For Germans in 2007, lower payments are at stake.
According to the forecast, this year, German employees threaten to reduce real wages despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts justified their pessimistic forecast with a number of reasons.
According to the Hanse Böckler Foundation estimates, the employed people can actually count in 2007 on getting a lower wage than last year.
"The blame bears a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn from the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
A new burden on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück to Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung said that the planned reduction of unemployment contributions to 3.3% in this situation is correct and reasonable for the new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be able to fall into such difficulties as to require the Federal Youth to require loans or contributions, quote the newspapers of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday it was published that the price explosion of food and oil products has driven inflation to its highest status in the last thirteen years.
In the annual comparison, the prices increased by three percent overall.
Venus is a hell of a twin Earth
Despite your life, the hostile atmosphere is more similar to Venus Earth than expected. The European space probe Venus Express in Venus has seen phenomenons appearing in the winter also on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and windy faith in the fields.
For almost three decades, scientists have thought they've been flashing in Venus.
Now, the European probe Venus Express has brought proof - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On the Venus, lightning from cloud to cloud height around 56 kilometres, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russel from the California University of Los Angeles.
According to known theory of the formation of primary matter, life could be created on Earth thanks to lightning. The storms allegedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, basic stones of life.
In Venus, it was not like, "If there was ever life there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"The outer may be a hell of a twin Earth, but he's a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth's mass and size, began to evolve completely differently, is the basic issue of Esa's mission.
Since no probe was sent exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus Express in November 2005, the launch of the Venus Express probe was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of research, which were closer to several articles of Nature magazine, did not just stress the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than expected so far," Esa said.
In addition to the already known windshields on the northern pole, scientists found a cloudy whirlpool on the southern pole, which is much faster.
This phenomenon reminds the airstreams of the northern hemisphere, writes the research team under Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Institut di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system consists of almost the same mass as Earth, and the average of 12 100 km is almost equal to the size.
This planet referred to as Jitřenka or Večernice will pass out the sun in 225 days.
But it turns much slower around its own axis, one day in Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although the Venus surface temperature is 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars of Earth is not recalled, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both, the water was accumulated, but on earth, it stayed in the oceans while out of Venus was out into space.
While carbon monoxide on Earth is bound on Earth in carbohydrates, in the country they form most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
The Federal President of Köhler calls for the end of the party disputes for the adoption of the Dalailles in the Chancellor Office.
He criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about the reputation of Germany and calls for a great coalition to end the sausage around the adoption of the Dalam.
"We should not be presenting ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not united in this matter," said Köhler to the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding for the decision by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt Dalam in September.
"If I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," said Köhler.
Although the Federal President emphasized that everyone knows that Germany has to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign politics, but that did not prevent Merkel from stopping himself when she was calculated to create a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional single China policy.
China also knows," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the adoption of Dalai Lama, and was therefore attacked by coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, on the "previous" foreign coalition policy.
Following the adoption of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor Office, the German-China relations have become worse.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of the German Minister for Finance of Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the information of the magazine SPIEGEL also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
The Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leaders, emphasised Wen Jiabao's position of China.
The words and acts of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet and other Tibetan areas, which are also located in the territory of China, are attempting to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that have erupted in France
Street fights with the police, shootings, fired cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that have exploded in France.
We have to do everything we can to make it so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not increase in violence on the street, calls on the Federal Minister of Interior.
The barricades burned, the riots shotguns shotguns fired the police. After serious youth disturbances in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments as well as in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create such a social tension that will spread in violence.
We have to take this seriously," said Neue Presse in the Hannover newspaper.
Not every young man can deal with a rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, the countries and municipalities are already working hard to remove problems, said Schäuble.
Which does not mean only integration of migrants.
"From the Summit on Integration to the Islam Conference, we have recorded the first success."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to the French.
In the past nights, they led youth with the police in the northern suburbs of Paris hard street battle.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Greater integration efforts by the German government demanded the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the disturbances in France, the Colat warned against the "recognition effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
However, it should be done.
The wheel pointed out that among people under 25 years of age, who came from migrant families, the unemployment rate "excessly high".
A higher number of study opportunities must be ensured first.
The wheel emphasized, "We must give you a young hope."
However, the President of the Turkish municipality added that, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from the families of migrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
The wheel asked, "But we have to keep an eye out."
We need to get a young man "speed to let them start working and educate."
Meanwhile, the night stayed in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel mostly calm.
There were hundreds of cops in the plant and helicopter flew over the area with headlamps.
The authorised authorities reported three arrests and several fired trash and cars.
Since yesterday, some 1,000 orderly forces have taken care of peace.
The police will intervene as long as it is necessary, she has notified the secretary of the Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie.
About 80 cops were injured in the riots at the Villiers-le-Bel suburbs on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's disturbances were delighted.
The mess caused a Sunday traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the State Prosecutor, there is no blame for the death of the juveniles.
In Angela's empire "Breaks"
The Chancellor's reality from the distance shows that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we cannot expect anything more from it alone.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her unpleasant, irrelevant and content-bound speech at the general debate of the Common House, we must state: not here - not in this country, which it should be managed after all.
To remorse that she was too focused on foreign politics, Angela Merkel once answered a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, and she showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were about.
In the House, she has clearly demonstrated how much she deserves that remorse.
Merkel didn't feel real interest, let alone feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela was presented "Oblaková": a politician who excels above others who run into foreign politics, and there is only vicious expression.
For example, climate protection: without interrupting, it is praised for the conclusions of the Heiligendamm Summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such praise - so many incredibities would have forgiven the president of the CDU two years ago.
It is now limited to false phrases that could increase its popularity between people.
This approach damages its imperial pragmatics, which does not need to flatter because they solve problems.
But in the realm of Angela, "Plauds" are internal political problems of a marginal matter.
Child poverty and the concerns of people with low wages?
A few side sentences left for her topics.
It's worth noting how often Merkels talk about children's allowances.
It's three times that Merkel has to start from the beginning to get her to say at least partly the right sentence.
As soon as things start to be too specific, it's sloppy as in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
In the case of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorable candidates, the Republican presidential candidates debated in a sharp discussion - and they must now be afraid of an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already shown on the first topic.
Mitt Romney is throwing away his opponent Rudy Guilianim that he made New York's "attack for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp remorse: "I think his own house was just one such shelter," responds and throws against the former governor of Massachusetts that he used to employ immigrants privately without evidence.
In view of the fact that the Republican base does not yet have a clear favority, eight presidential candidates use these debates on the CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, internet users filmed and via Youtube uploaded videos serve only as such as help of the key topic.
"That's exactly the policy of isolationism we've allowed Hitler to take power," says John McCain, his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who is proposing the immediate withdrawal of the troops from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain does not spare his remorse or Romney, for refusing to condemn the torture method called "Waterboarding", in which the heating is simulated.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg show that the important topics of the campaign are not even war in Iraq, nor methods of torture.
In applause, at any time the conservative values are praised and the future tax increase is rejected.
So it turns out where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was mistaken that time," explains the stubbornly Romney and asks the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for the fact that in 1994 he was an advocate of the execution of abortions.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express himself to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
The Musharraf first rules in civility
The day after his resignation from the position of the chief commander of the army, the Pakistani ruler of Musharraf made a presidential oath.
That ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan Parvíz Mušaraf made a presidential oath on Thursday and lasts five more years in the presidential office.
Pakistan's television carried out a live ceremony held in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore he would honor the constitution and seek the good of the nation.
On the Wednesday, he handed over his chief commander to Ashfaq Kiyanim, which undermines international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after a bloody military reverse took power, the former general ruled for the first time as a civilian head of the state.
By resigning from the position of the Chief of Armed Forces, Mušaraf met one of the major requirements of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional state which Mušaraf declared on 3 November.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Malik Muhammad Qayyuma, Musaraf will cancel the exceptional state soon after its commitment, and thus meet the other requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, who, after the publication of an exceptional state at the beginning of November, dismissed all objections about the contested re-election of the State head of 6 October, in the past week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the attack on the military convoy in the North Vazíristan tribal area, and four others were injured.
The spokesman said the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
My fathers are coming back.
The famous German group of the 1970s plays again. Three members of the Harmonia Group have re-changed their electronic synthesizers at the concert in Berlin.
The Revival will also include the Live 1974, the cut from the most successful time of the band.
They were much more known abroad that time.
The declared sensation then lies in the performance of three used masters who at first look like they're just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and most of them buttons.
The 30-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snowy shirt is sitting in the middle.
There's a seventy-five-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and guitar in front of his left.
The three-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, which is concentrated over the synthesizers, is from the perspective of the viewers on the right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, certainly imperfectly, will create traditional songs.
Looks like it's too cool with the masters of musicians.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, the band Harmony was revival of a great start.
One thing is worth noticeing, the repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is definitely not enough to miss this band for twenty-three years painfully.
But why can't Germany even celebrate his still living legends from the '70s?
And especially when you have a musical style, a misappropriated Krautrock, England and America appreciate more than in their own country.
In 2003, when musical business was awarded to the remaining members of the Can Cologne Group, Echo price for life’s work, the hall was full of queer views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked in their speech by La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the divers amaze no longer knew the borders.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts with them as their old friend on stage.
The problem of ignorance at home and affection in the foreign country is one thing.
By remembering the band, Harmony is unnecessarily overloading the memory, this trio existed just for two years, and at that time, it had no effect on others.
Moebius and Roedelius have already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement of the Berlin Theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for the company's gramophone led by the church.
Rother soon remembered in the Kraftwerk group, but the reputation became a guitarist at the Neu! band, which may have been the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973 Rother followed the band Cluster musicians into exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of the municipalities that fled from the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to be a nanny.
It was rather a life in such a spitwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the singing congregation Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was found in the dumpster.
A lot of this has been preserved by Harmony.
The first album was "Human of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quietly and modestly, the band suffered financial difficulties.
The collection of peanuts did not just serve self-recognition.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was reported to be cut off in Griessem's concert in front of a rekordly small, barely 50-member stage.
Rother said the wishes that the members of Harmon would heal and occasionally exercise.
For Roedlio and Moebia, it was a totally rude requirement.
In 1975, the band announced its breakdown.
Rother ended up in an aesotheric sphere, and he insured his future with "Sheart burning" album.
Cluster's band has regained again in the '80s, and since then it's been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for a live album from Griessemer.
His record company Grönland took care of as an original German contribution to live music as a target.
The band Neu! was then considered Roedeli's solo work.
Harmonia will be resurrected in Berlin’s World Cultural House.
The Woldtronics Festival performance will be publicly sponsored.
The British, Julian Cop, the old punk and the author of "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's how we wiped out the overall width of the effect of the Krautrock on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will just fill out Harmony.
The age of Brian En, accompanied by the most amazing noises, is rising in the hall: "One true music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the manufacturer and Harmony is in a farm seat.
To create a legend, it also contributes to the screening of other black and white photos on which a set of instruments of wild cables are connected.
Before that, they are three veterans engaged again in improvisation.
Not by sticking microphones to the organs and drums to eliminate those never heard of self-produced tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like an electronic music.
Three to the technician scattering.
It doesn't change the House of World Culturals.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place emphaticly sings "Aaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
We would rather find roots than in blues at musical universities (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever yells "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not get out of peace right now.
Even the most selfish thoughts on the scene.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question will either be prepared for the nerves of the person, or will give him to experience the passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden appeared two films about the war on the Balkans.
But neither one of them is convincing.
The image of films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
The Hunting Party can't stop actor Richard Gere.
Good news first: War criminals Karadit and Mladić are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but right there, in the cloudy base of the Bosen War, the actor Richard Gere acetates.
We have recently lost this most beautiful man of the 1980s from our eyes, not only because he has played in many loving, immeasurable roles in nice women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on Buddhism topics, they take a taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument to see the Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes prey (Why must the names of movies be so long and confused these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially what Gere could become if the fate and the film business were not so merciful: a man who has had his best years long ago, but as a wreck of a memorial like that, he still maintains some remarkable charm.
But despite this trumf is the Hunting Party along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinema this week, just by continuing the endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkan.
With Mörderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian girl from a cossy sniper, yet one of them falls in love with it.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television plastic film is changing too soon to shoot and action.
The movie leaves something very similar to the show of Kobra 11, without the highway, but for the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, it is possible to examine in its opinion why the Balkan War has not yet been able to make a really good film.
The story of the three American war reporters who are experiencing behind the "lisk", the Serbian top war criminal, would be another director and writer (here is Richard Shepard) might become a new "Apocalypse".
For both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is unable to do, but their way to madness will happen.
One of the reasons for the failure of the movie The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the guilty and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the predecessor will prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party's film can ultimately write down after the reporters have done what NATO, the CIA and all the criminals have failed in the past five years: catch the criminals and leave him a fair revenge to the Muslims.
It's so against the logic of film production that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Hague.
At the same time, this film has a deeper human message.
It condemns that Karadit and Mladić are still free, and suspects Americans and French (they are exceptionally united) that, on the basis of secret political agreements, they do not pursue very intensely.
But good and evil are so similar sometimes, women think of the famous poem of Brecht.
In it is a wooden mask of the Asian demon on the work table of the writer: "I look at the rigid veins on my forehead, noted how hard it is to be evil.
In movies like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly such stubborn heads, which suggest how effortful it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
It was recently written in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were great failures.
The only one can be added to this: There has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always applies: When the star hangs around the crisis area or walks through the mining field, there will be a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Hranice breaking with Angela Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprie.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
After all, they had to run tens of years before Hollywood could make a good movie about Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must probably come up - films that are now considered classical Vietnamese works - "The Love of Jelens", "Apocalypsa" or "The Slave Vest" - were in no case celebrated as masterpieces.
But maybe today, when every mass murder comes home immediately on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Scenarios do not have the ability to tell good stories unrestrictedly.
"Being or not being" or "Great dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcasticly measured artistic view as a Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked for a parallel between his historical novel "Lemprièr's dictionary" and "Balkan War", he said, "Podoba only touches that some things never change.
The great cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and also will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvests criticism for rejecting the Olympics
The resignation of the mayor from organising summer Olympic games in Hamburg has encountered a sharp criticism of politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for organizing games at the water.
Von Beust, however, asks for realism in a chance.
The main operator of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, in the midst of the decision "in business terms as unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened in the city as much motivation as an Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, this sports political enthusiasm could not be kept so high."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but he created a new long-term concept for him, "which comes from a changed time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained in the midst of his former statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic by 2028.
"No Hamburg, but the German Olympic sports union decides about the Olympic Candidate", said von Beust to the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on the Munich Candidate at the winter game in 2018.
"This preference for us means we don't have a realistic chance with a time plan counting 2028."
Yet this dream is not over, he said von Beust.
Hamburg's sports union (HSB) marked von Beust's statements as regrettable.
He feels like Hamburk wants to go to the Olympic Games in the next 20 years.
"It is too soon to destroy the chance that we will mark plans in this early stage as buried," said President Günter Ploss at the center of the HSB.
The termination of avoidance would be contrary to the statement by the chief of the Senate, which he said at the General Meeting of the German High School Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce the Hamburg Candidate at the University of 2015 as a substitute for organizing Olympic games.
The high-school sports union of Hamburk only nominated for the candidate city last week.
The SPD fraction in the Senate's Hamburg Parliament concluded that it was was a waste of valuable time, which could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the area of Klein Grasbrook has been hampered for the Senate for years, because he has put on the organizing of the Olympics and the construction of the apartments excluded," said Ms. SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the area of Klein Grasbrook was still planning the Olympics with the fact that the whole area will be used later for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously put on the "olympic factor".
To avoid the summer Olympic Games in 2012 caused great thrills in Hamburg.
He lost Hamburg in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's box.
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and wooden boxes doesn't think of Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes produced currently in Sweden are throwing on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadows.
Most of it on the list of 90 mentioned four "Brillo boxs" of Stockholm are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has raised doubts about the authenticity of the Warhol "Brillo Boxs" in 1968, the inner research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm with the result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxs", which in 1995 the Moderna Museet Museum devoted to the gift of his former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as well as most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm, which are on the international market in circulation.
The previous events are a confused, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo box in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes, which were based on red blue paper box of soap powder Brillo.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 demonstrated - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes of cardboard. They were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't artwork, it was about their foreplays, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave a permit in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo beden in Sweden, but they are not exposed in Modern Museet.
Today's witnesses are now talking about fifteen boxes, which, by the time, came into art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with titled Stockholm type.
Some of them were spent on auctions for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was produced in Sweden and exposed to approximately a hundred boxes that Warhol left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén beans were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrohrad only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after his death at that time.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, examined except for six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collections, of which two were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their sleeve plates were wiped with basic color and stitched, were brushed with oil white color.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copy revealed that the colour was carried directly on the sleeve plate without the previous basic paint. In addition, it was acrylic and not oil color.
"These boxes were not authorised by an artist and should be removed from Warhol's official papers of Brillo Boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the organization of Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to have six boxes of his exhibition collections classified as "the exhibition material - copies".
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these "true charges" were raised in the case of a box with soap powder will be dealt with.
However, the organization continues to remain in disproportionate silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manile surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who became established in one hotel in Manile and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The chief of rebels Antonio Trillanes, who referred the president to manipulation and corruption in the elections, told the reporters in the hotel that he refused the bloodshed.
Soldiers of dedication attacked the government earlier with the deployment of tear gas on the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers have turned up in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the trials of the year 2003, Trillanes was also among them.
He used the negotiations to escape with his 30 sympathizers.
Military policemen, who were to guard him, clearly crossed his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the hotel Peninsula and demanded resignation from President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
