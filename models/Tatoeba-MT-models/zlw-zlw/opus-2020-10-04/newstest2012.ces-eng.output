Parliament did not support the Tymošenk release novel
The Ukrainian Parliament rejected today the proposal to abolish in the context of the amendment of the criminal law, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition Julija Tymošenková was convicted.
Member States have rejected the second reading of the proposal to mitigate the sanctions for economic offensives.
In October, Tymošenková was sentenced to seven years of prison for a allegedly disadvantaged contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the convicted is to discuss the judgment in December.
Tymošenková refers to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime, suspicion of the suspicion of the court's suspicion has brought up the trial and the West.
The proposal to exclude paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the expremier was convicted, has supported 147 Members in the vote.
226 votes were needed to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebuilt, has already defeated.
Muammar Kaddáfí is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it is a war.
The winners are left to be defined.
As is used in the country, Islamists will win in elections, but it is about whether dying or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customs law of the Sharía and we have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a country without criminality, because the hand is closed for stealing.
Women can forget the emancipation, any disbelievers from faith are waiting for execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, the company consisting of the rival tribes will unite the coronary.
There's gonna be a order in Libya that we can't imagine, and that's definitely not what we'd like.
But our way of life is neither the only one, nor objectively the best, and probably would not suit the Libyans of the same way to change.
Actually, it's weird that Islamic warriors took gratitude from the unbelievers of dogs.
It's only apologizing that from their point of view, some general from America, but Alah, whose size was celebrated in every intervention.
So when the winners are looking for in Libya, the west does not belong to them.
We participated in shootings, served Islam, and our politicians disposed of a political ally in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't shop militaryly.
By the way, there's a problem for the locals to expel the cruisers.
But without the occupation of the oil company, they're gonna have a tiny Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the west will finally be able to boast with the unprofitful protection of human rights.
Unless it ruins your lawful chariot.
The new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have entered the investor search engine.
The statistical stench crossed Europe on Tuesday.
Individual States have published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated inter-quarterly, Germany and France are growing.
But the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP increased by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries were also adjusting the dates for the second quarter, in which Germany was better than expected (a rise of 0.3% of the original 0,1%), and France stated that it appeared in a mild decline by 0.1% (originating data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy in this third quarter increased by 1.5 percent annually.
However, the average gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and thus confirmed the trend in gradual slowdown in economic performance.
The results are worse than the analyst estimates.
Important events:
The Czech economy in this third quarter has increased by 1.5 percent on an annual basis, but has stagnated in four years.
The German economy in the third quarter according to the preliminary and seasonally recalculated data increased by 0,5 percent.
The euro area economy and the European Union increased by 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with analytical expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent annually.
The balance on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
The income of Italian and Spanish bonds is growing to critical limits.
The problems are starting to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Expenditure in Czech 10-year bonds is maintained below 4%, even if the region's situation is worsening.
Germany sounds like the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs have been qualified for the EURO.
In Black Mountain, they won 1:0 and celebrate the procedure for 200 million
Football representation has accomplished the hardest task of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Bohemian and the beautiful brance of Petr Jiráčka won 1:0.
The Czech Football, with great luck in the second half of the time, has made a luxury start from home retaliation and will not be lacking again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz watched progression in detailed reports.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great portion of luck in the other.
The Czech representation also thanks to the domestic vomiting in the end, the great Bohemian and hero Jirake won a happy 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the process for the championship of Europe.
The Black Horses got pressure in the second half because of the precise defense of the Czech whole.
The losers of the game became Damjanovich with Vuczynnik, who burned two great chances.
Even with great Peter Bohemia, the Czech representation will not be missed next year at Europe's championship, an award of about 200 million crowns is added to domestic football money.
He's been playing a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were just hard to connect and mostly played around the half line.
The pressure of domestic soccer players did not come in the first half, because the Czech Defense Defense had turned away precisely.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a live shield
Several hundred students created a live shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
They want to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country before possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed before the object on Tuesday, and then called for the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students in Iranian Isfahan have created a live shield around the Isfahian nuclear technology centre in which uranium is processed on Tuesday.
They show that they are ready to defend the nuclear programme of their country by their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) found that Iran had not ceased to seek nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is spoken in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahian nuclear object and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose purpose would be to protect Iran’s nuclear programme as far as possible, Israel’s press besides the Isphahian Centre would also aim at the establishment in Natanz, in which uranium is enriched.
Occupational child's meal: no breakfast and dinner of wheat
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with an excessive weight of 9 percent of schoolers and obese are 5 percent of children.
Obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle, as the current survey showed.
It turns out again how important it is for the healthy development of a person's environment in which he grows up and the patterns surrounded by them.
For example, there are more than half of them on tables in obese children than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried fries had a day before the research associated with the Obezita events was not a coincidence of more than 19 percent obese.
In fattening families, it is also not a habit of sporting, which, however, concerns most of the families of schoolers today - only 15 percent of children have responded that their parents will find at least once a week time to move actively.
Research between 900 children
The research took place at the end of last year of school and took part in 900 primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It has already been the second year of the event Obezita is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolers from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
At the same time, proper food and enough movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically rising number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the questions, for example, said that she was five times a day in the breakfast-svačina-summer regime, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition," is one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no wheat evening
Experts point out that for healthy developments there are significant and relative details, including regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of schoolers are breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was to find out there's no breakfast in ten households at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are much more consumed.
Almost everyone - no matter the weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent).
While he regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children concerned, the result was less than half - 15 percent in their parents.
Get your diner together.
Another part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own menus from the options offered according to their own taste and own opinion.
"The training preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
There are lots of flourish, meat and sweet dishes among their favorite dishes.
"Alarming is in particular a great popularity of sweet lemonades," says the final report on the survey.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won just over poultry.
But the children practically didn't want lushes and it's low as well as the popularity of fish and luncheon dishes.
Adherence to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their dietary habits if they get the right information.
"In the survey control group, which completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the Obezita Is not a coincidence, there has been a significant shift in preference towards the principles of healthy nutrition," says the results of the project.
It was marvelous, for example, for sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children also have much more often checked in the poultry and fish questionnaire as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet food and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, claiming professionals
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I've been kind of complaining that it's been a lot in the opening hours.
I had no idea what would be next.
Lectures of three professions from the field, dressing of problematic figures and a seminar on how it goes.
And it'll be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, he's really "bumped."
This time, Director Alenka and I were discussing (he's not the only boy in the course), how to dress a woman who doesn't have a perfectly symmetrical character.
And that's what most of them are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's a boy's character without a proper curve and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, extend his neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips, both with Jennifer Lopez's wife, the bigger tits and hips and a tight passport, the character to emphasise well and at the same time not to dress a woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the passport and the sides is such that the skirts or the pants really don't fit, then it's worth having at least one of those pieces in peace.
Surely you won't regret it, because the perfect fallout clothes are worthless.
In a room skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves you, elevates, rests in the passport and so on.
A boy's character can also afford to wear garments, apps, embroidery or charging clothes.
Such information and characters are, of course, a lot, so I'm glad I've had all week to keep all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid, given the homework given, it's too much.
For each of the coursers received the assigned celebrity, which should make two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the personality and the character.
I'm gonna dress Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, for me personally certainly better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who has recently gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the oversight) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the dresses out of magazines or search on the Internet and print and then process graphically.
The Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphics.
Thinking about the graphic page of style is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (on specific terms, such as purse trends, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's not Sunday.
Stylist must have a general view
Saturday's lecture with information on the types of figures was set up immediately by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Humble, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a skillful stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So, for example, a trenchcoat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically through jeans and a shirt like a coat, but you can dress it on a bare body, put the boat on and take the picture as a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or the collar and look different now.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I most appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
Finally, I can see why we are crushing all the lessons we have to combine with, why, while we see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the show.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist has to have a lot more variants of clothes prepared than how many to take pictures.
So, at fashion story, which will have ten pages (then ten outfits), I must be prepared to "cover" at least fifteen.
And also that it looks on the picture of clothes and works in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely differently than in fact.
So we have to count on that in creating outfit.
That the image and style make up half the success, confirmed us Honza humility.
All you need to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a charming singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylist services is rather cold.
The well-known faces consider him unnecessary (it's enough that I can do something, what I look like, is secondary).
And if someone has already made style from us, then we're supposed to count on the fact that we are very likely to oversight into a completely different (lower) size than it really has.
Then there's nothing left to googlate and see if the boulevard did not write about the celebrity to become silent and the same.
Honza and Mario put on our hearts on Sunday that the stylist is not sufficient to orient themselves in fashion and to learn how to lay outfits.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people who dress, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to encourage yourself, to follow your opinion.
"When you're ordered by a manager, you're gonna get her a wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the entire locker and tell her, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you will commend and recommend what they can wear for," says Maria.
He also showed us what everything must contain a so-called "platz", or a bag to the square.
It's the one you put on the passport and you have all the necessary property.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair rollers or pins, there are also silon yarns (with it the stylist helps to take pictures of products such as purse or hats), special cliffs that we put in the back of the dress if there is larger (screw or other clamps are not acceptable, they would damage the garments), or a sewing.
To avoid listening, but also practically try something, we learned how to put our shoes right.
Even when taking pictures in the studio, where it is a straight surface, the insult could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the scissors without any damage.
It is therefore necessary to be skilled.
Mario delighted me when he commended my creation without a reservation.
Because the skill mentioned is not really my friend.
This is just a little fraction of what we've heard about the second weekend course.
I'm getting more clear to me that taking a styling at a professional level is not really a walk with a pink set, whether anyone wants to say what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
Reviews
Originally, careless rides for a series of completely unnecessary laydaic errors change in a routine morning trip to the shift.
Although the ambition has succeeded in a great deal, it's not important if anyone obviously didn't want to do anything extra.
The new piece with the sub-titule The Run was built before the high expectations were issued.
He promised that the summer racing series Need for Speed would move again a piece in a new direction and from playable shows appeared as a game that in the genre of action racing would not only have to be in number.
We were also curious to see how the passages they would get, where the prime hero would get out of the car and go on his own.
As the NFS series has already been used, many are a little different from the result than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcadic races, but the whole is dragging down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in the series for several years.
So it's actually not even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some kind of incomprehensible lenacy of developers.
Adventure starts very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel, you'll use the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to arrive first to New York.
The idea brings several interesting elements.
The route is divided into 10 stages, and then into more than 50 races.
This shows that each race is on a different line and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment to feel like the game would always offer the same thing.
In addition, some of the environment are very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing global.
But the ride across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are stirred from time to time by some unusual element.
Thus, in the desert, for example, you contribute to the sand storm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to catch avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well planted.
There's only a few types, but that's enough.
So you try to pass the desired number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then again catching time (classic fight with stamps) and then there's a duel waiting for you with a single opponent.
In addition, from time to time, the police will be involved, which will make all your efforts even more uncomfortable.
The news is passages out of the car.
It's more than an interactive animation, when Jack usually runs before someone, and you have to help him in that so that at the right moments you print the right buttons.
Nothing complicated.
But it will surprise that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (most likely only three).
In the result, however, it is to benefit the matter because this element has no chance to become annoying, and in the context of the above, it is in line with the elements that turn the game.
The driving model goes on tracks of previous parts.
This means that this is definitely no longer the case, but it cannot be said to be a disagreement.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But a more acknowledged racing here, the bike model is still quite good, even though we could find better in competition.
So that way, everything is in perfect order.
But the problems start to appear after some time.
Unlike the driver model, the model is no longer well.
We don't expect the game of this type to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but when virtually no impact in any object you have no idea how your car behaves, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you pass or pass cars in normal traffic, you sometimes just lick each other easily, but another time in almost identical situation your car ends in wild piruettes.
Or even attack directly.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn't matter especially, but it'll confidently distract you.
Reboots are solved so that if you smash or drive far away from the line, the game will throw you back on the last catch point on the line.
Only the restarts are only five available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more like a help in case something goes wrong than you can rely on them specifically.
Sometimes, but they don't even help the restarts, it solves them when the need to learn the section of the memory race.
The great distress of the game is that the same thing is often happening in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit in.
Once again, you will meet the "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute later.
It's particularly upset in situations where you see how a rival will easily pass between two anti-driven cars before you, while when you arrive there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to travel or pull them down.
It doesn't matter when you get to them because it's "counted" so that the situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
The opponents have another advantage.
During the play, you're going to meet several places where you, no matter what time, will always be the same rival in the same place.
Most of it hits the end of the game on the long bridge where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get in front of you, obviously, at any price.
When he's in front of you, he's making you feel worse about the anti-road cars, so at first, you're going to get there a couple of times.
You can understand the intention of making a game more exciting and more adrenaline, but the execution is so obvious that it will disguise you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple bike model, it's fun to play places and so much action that you don't literally watch what's flying.
And basically, it doesn't matter whether the concept of 50 unique tracks is worthy of it, the ranking of races so that boring doesn't have a chance or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to replace cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the road, because there you can change the car, even though in most cases you can do enough with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
They are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on straight highways and exotic supersports on technical riding, for example, on the clicked mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and fashion challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
For obtaining a higher level of drivers, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ends with backgrounds for profile.
It is once again connected to the online function of Autolog, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard to understand is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will reach the tunnel of the meter (it will be), where you will marry it in the dark after the tracks (it will be).
There are numbers between 150 and 200 km/h on the tachometer, and in the back the meter sets and inconsistently you will be crushed.
In the editorial, we'll have a few more days to discuss whether there's no one ever thought about us in making a game, or whether the authors think of us as such a big jerk.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in several cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more dense moments the image drops, and in some cases it's pretty tragic.
However, this is mainly about crashes with a larger number of participants, where you would have had nothing to do with the smooth image.
The soundtrack is all right and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In trying to enjoy the widest range of younger publications, soundtrack was created from the category "every dog other villages", but you can assume that because of listening to music, the game probably won't be bought.
Overall impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so much distressed.
If the game was to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that the run is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game works inexperienced.
I'm sure it's fun, but prepare for mistakes to wipe you in the eye with the power of airport headlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation of negativeists and eurosceptics
"Lisabonese Treaty has significantly distorted the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation becomes a little stable, calm, and before all players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador at the European Union, Milena Vicen, began to draw up her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
As far as its motto "Cutely and openly about Europe" has been taken seriously, it has already shown in the first part of the lectures where it managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations so clear and understandablely that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law could envy her.
Vicen also commended the work of the new Permanent Chairman of the European Council of Herman Van Rompuy:
"Sometimes there was a critique that he was indiscriminate that he was a grey official that he couldn't do any role, and I have to say that everyone's breath came out that he's made the role perfectly."
"It is a person who can listen to twenty seven Member States, who is well communicated with them and has a clear vision where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is that of the European Union? Which phone number should I call?" as a significant step towards unity and greater readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from the raws.
Vicen was also devoted to the agenda that the European Council lived, living and living in the near future.
The Czech presidency has marked success.
The Czechs have dealt with the ongoing financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
At this time, the government was referred to as a major negative that has severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very urgent.
The Ambassador, "fact frmol" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is very complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and cost-effective, which sectors will be preferred which countries will be supported more and which are less, all this is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also reminded her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "A Europe understandably."
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, a hantry that no one understands.
How a citizen should understand that they do not really invent curved or round cucumbers, bananas differently large, or that someone really has to prohibit us with meals."
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the Ambassador, Czechs have a reputation of eurosceptics and people who notice more of the negative pages than positive.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Bohemia in European institutions.
She believes that there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write incentive letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, Visegrad Four has raised strength and cooperation.
"Believ me, when Polák and Hungarian come to me, and the Slover approaches me, the Frenchman next to me will say, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?" and it doesn't even make you excited?"
The future of the Union, according to the Vicen, is particularly awaiting new tough rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
As a very real concept of two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation."
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have Schengen space, we have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said to cooperate only with the countries they want, and those who don't want to stand down."
"These institutes will be more and it will be a powerful two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in implementing the principle that all the topics that have an impact on the whole of the Union have to be discussed between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If anyone was looking for a word that expresses the most accurate IBM strategy, it would probably be the closest "long term".
For the broad public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as a very current, and yet it has passed a hundred years since its establishment.
The basis for this long-term has been laid down by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already hit the password that a number of world problems can be easily resolved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" thus became a print, around which the life of the future gigant will be revolved (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be based in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means long-term thinking constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around herself.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first centuries.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve even more," said the current director Samuel J. Palmisano.
Developed system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees like the Baťa businessman in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees paid a vacation, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a developed system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
Similarly, IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company has been brilliant from the beginning in the exploitation of talents - as one of the first global companies has abolished any discrimination, so she could choose.
In accordance with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will be headed by IBM in the next year - Virginia Rometty.
It has been in IBM for thirty years, so far it has become the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called pits, on-line brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovation arise.
No wonder there's enough ideas in the company working almost half a million people.
Institution with a good name
A firm position in business provides its strong internal and external image.
"Since the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said professor of Harvard Business School and the author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps deal with business problems in using technology," said George Colony from Forrester Research consulting company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is known as her logo in the United States - has grown into one of the biggest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most comprehensive technology company - developing hardware and software, infrasturuture, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
He holds the most patents from all American technology companies, and five of her employees have won Nobel's prize.
Its inventions include a bankomat, a credit card, a financial swap, a line code or a disk.
IBM was about $220 billion this year that became the second largest technology company according to market capitalization (the first is Apple) when Microsoft first had presided since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovation hit the taste of customers and times - IBM did not manage the bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy and PCjr online services.
"If your business is built on the move forward, you can't emotionally pinch on the past," Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on Windows's operating system.
Perspective technologies
In IBM markets, the biggest share of the services is, after about five is formed by software and hardware.
In 1990 he was with more than half the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000 IBM sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, invested 58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies during the same period.
Investments have been ongoing since 2008, when the world’s first overrun of the modern financial crisis.
IBM is acting according to the reference of his first Chief Thomas J. Watson, which also increased the volume of investments during the large economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is undergoing the current crisis.
The price of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent of missiles since the beginning of 2008, the net profit of the company continues to grow.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything, but not its values.
Therefore, this flexible gigant can be expected to handle it even if the next crisis comes.
History of the IBM: From the cheese cutter to the universe
IBM (International Business Machines) was created in New York a hundred years ago, originally had a Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over in 1924 - originally the brand used for branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM gave the merger to four companies whose history reaches in the 19th century.
They owned technology, such as the famous "bags," that is, clocks that record employees of coming and leaving.
Charles Ranlett Flint was the architect of the new company, who also chaired the company's supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired the head of Thomas J. Watson's competition company to help him manage the company.
The leader then swept the founder of IBM - on Watson's ideas is still building an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it suggests its name, began with the production and sale of alloy business machines - from meat cutters and cash cheese.
During the first four years, Watson was headed by the company, he doubled to turn to nine million dollars and started an extensive expansion of the company into all the world.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that almost 40 years later, in the boss chair, his son Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the '60s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to drive flights to space - to Merkur, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of a man on the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - a number of IBM System/360.
The classic "people" that has developed the computer standard of that time, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
20 years later, IBM sold the production of Lenovo's Chinese computers, on the contrary, she bought a consultancy part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to consult and serve with high added value.
The strategy that has been paid in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, the smarter planet.
Its objective is to use technologies in unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city administration.
For the trade area, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history even in the country.
She established her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, other than IBM, the Czech Republic also operates the centre of strategic outsourcing in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a research team of world level dealing with the recognition of voice.
An unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Rychtary (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and come home.
But now she's not waiting for her, and she's made clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," she explained Rychtress.
When Darina Rychtář in the summer she provided Bartoš's asylum in her house, she probably didn't even seem to know how her marriage ended.
Even though Iveta had moved out of the Roman for 30 days, Pepa had not abandoned the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In the course of time, Darina resigned with her husband's relationship, and now she even gave him a goodbye forever.
Rychitists don't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the sailor and Bartos broke up only once, his wife's open arms won't be waiting at home.
"He's my son's biological father, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will chase him out."
"But he will live not as my beloved, miserable old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtary, "so she was getting away from her husband and insisting only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina closed his back door is okay with him so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will with Iveta and I will not change it."
"The wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"Firma's moving on, I'm looking after repairs, gardens, real estate, shopping."
"We're having a normal conversation with Darina, except we don't share beds together," said Błyskawica.
If the Rychtler found a new love, she said she wouldn't be able to defend her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he's going with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take all my responsibility," Joseph closed up.
The worst women's habits: do they concern you?
If you ask men, if they can exclude some typical women's naughty habits, usually everyone in one is a very hot sleeve.
Dear women, will you meet in the following lines, where a number of women's nauseas that can perfectly disperse men's blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half count you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like shopping and masculine in discounts?
Then, in your case, we can talk about shopping as an evil habit.
Some women realize that they should at least take a little bit of their buyer passion.
But tell me who would resist it just walk around the clothes stores, looking for a well fallen uppers and then try them all in the cabin?
Even though most women are shopping hobby, they can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you before the entrance...
Continuous dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
Stronger sex also matches the fact that the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and purity at first
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, drying, wiping tiles, wiping dust, wiping a bath - at least twice a week.
You're reading to your partner that he walked dirty legs on a clean tile, the kids that spilled a sink and wore a glass living wall with which you've done so much work?
In case you suffer this "conflict" right now, try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and purity should definitely not become in the family's first place.
This harmless desire for purity may jeopardise your relationships and your family's comfort.
Scattering
"These used trunks throw in the trash."
"You're gonna wear these old socks tomorrow too?"
"The wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you do this to your partner several times a day, you know that you can make him so reliablely.
Of course you don't mean anything wrong, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if the men knew, women wouldn't have to do that again...
Hugging, whispering
For some women there are also own rumors, rumors, and insults and associations against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Hopefully, each of us, some kind of harmless gossip or gossip will release in here.
Hand on the heart, it's own to all women.
On the contrary, however, the vibes of the most gross grain that they like and often gossip, perhaps they are everyone who are despised and disapproved for their surroundings - especially in the context of women's work collective - especially dangerous ones.
Jagr and Voráček helped with the assistance to win Philadelphia
The Hockey Attack Jaromír Jagr participated in the Monday NHL game by two assists in winning Philadelphia 5:3 in the ice of Carolina and is once again leading the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From an overview of the nine-year-old stars he enjoyed in both cases Claude Giroux, who added one more credit and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists in the match also recorded Jagra's co-worker Jakub Voráček.
After playing the overseas journalists, the jagrian claimed that Giroux had foretold a big night.
"I told him before the game, he'd give him hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes, you feel like you're gonna fall apart," explained Jagr, after which he gave Giroux goal from the first shot of Flyers.
A little later, he had a second hit on the Czech trail team.
The vortex fought behind the Hurricanes gate and presented it between Maxi Talbot's scoring circles.
One second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer reduced in weakening the home player, but the introduction of the second part was again Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After co-operating with Jagr, he shot the third goal, then his shooting melted the flow in the fourth gate of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," he appreciated his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hockey like him."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in NHL, my teammates tried to play at me, now it's turning around," he added Jagr.
Carolina made a drama from the game, the goal of Tuoma Ruutua, and again, Dwyer, who got out of criminal shooting, got in the verge of one goal.
Another complications, however, did not allow Matt Read, who ended the renunciation of two to one.
"He hit a great deal in our Pronger band."
"He wiped the disc, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farther rod."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," described the last goal of the match from my point of view Voreáček.
Philadelphia got to the front of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not play a fight against Buffal, in the second third he resigned because of the injuries in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens, next to the test bench, lost the two guns and lost the penalt shot of 2:3.
One of their raids didn't turn Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points were wrecked by a large mother of rear rows, while the match was played only for five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We played games with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The shifting was on us and we couldn't resist."
"We were supposed to simplify the game, move the rifle out of our band."
We had gaps in that," said one of the defenders of P.K. Subban.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions to the winner of 5:2 above Tampou Bay.
The goals of Jets, who interrupted the five-time series of procures, were divided by five different shooters.
As the tour prices have developed since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel agencies were authorised in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Auto tourist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in the vicious majority only tours to the country of the socialist block, since traveling to the west was very limited.
Thus Czech tourists traveled on holiday to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (at the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility of traveling to Yugoslavia was also possible, but the Yugoslav regime was then very limited to the West and the routes of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist block (i.e. also the Czechoslovakia) allowed individually to travel even within socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a call letter from this country, otherwise an individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand a front overnight with a sleeper or have a "good known" in the travel agency.
However, it has not been won in the same way.
The so-called foreign promise, which was a condition for traveling to the West, was not granted to "politically inseparable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currencies were not freely alterable, without a foreign allowance was thus not possible to obtain funds (western currency) for the trip to the West.
However, the Czechs spent the most often vacation in the country, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalets that Czechs had acquired and this habit survived today.
Traveling Bohemians has thus experienced real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 she was vacationed in the NDR or Bulgaria our maximum, the Czechs spent 4,5 miles abroad in the countries of the world last year.
The huge paradox we don't realize today is that to us today, the most popular Croatia has not been able to travel freely until 1989, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very end of the 1990s, visas have been cancelled into the neighbouring western European countries, which has started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially Austrian Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakia couldn't have had trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to take a look at it for at least a minute.
For example, Czech tours were burned in tents in Paris, because our revenues were not allowed to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of the Czech travel was to be carried by its own food, canned, salami, etc. to save themselves.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely changeable Czech crown, so our tourists finally could buy the Western currency freely after many decks of years.
However, our level of life and the average salaries increased, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to an increased demand for travel, travel agencies have been regularly preparing tours by chartered airline connections since 1997, thereby making air tours unreliable thanks to the possibility of bargaining quantitative discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa free contacts in virtually all advanced countries of the world, except for the USA, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution travel occurred in 2000, where, thanks to a large demand, he was released from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exotic, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, the Czech tourists have been flying direct charters to hot far countries every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries will now visit around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutional development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US visa for Czech tourists cancelled and our country ultimately ranked among the world's most successful countries.
In 2008, also the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history, and spent for one foreign holiday, including the cost of more than 15 thousand CZK per person.
The General Assembly should find the President again, but it threatens to be
Almost five months is Czech football without the President and threatens that the successor of Ivan Haška in the Head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburg.
Because there is still no agreement under which order will be followed.
Without it, he won't even start to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest of leading Czech football has Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
The Hašek resigned in June and invited his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hašk football has slipped back to the points between the two union chambers that cannot agree to a common candidate.
This showed on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Meeting went unnecessarily to the National House in Prague in Smíchov, because the negotiations remained blocked and not only the way to choose.
It was not even a match that had the right to vote in the pile - whether only the statutory representatives, or also the officers of the full authority.
In this only point, there has been a partial consensus since then, which also helped the State Constitution's Recommendation and the right under which full power representation is not possible.
But there's still a lot to do about the election order.
Nor did the executive committee, who has already dealt with in their meetings, whether proper or exceptional, put too clearly in the situation, in principle nothing else.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do you proceed at 3nd round to eliminate the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or to find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dušan Freedom, representing professional football in the management of the Association.
According to the statutes of the model proposed in the third round, he will win from candidates who will have more percentage support in the chamber for whom he runs.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to a retreat to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech Party promotes the condition that the winner has to gain at least two-thirds overlapping at this percentage.
"But it would then remove the meaning of two previous rounds, that would completely deny the two chamber concept," states the objections of the Moravian Party of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to move and vote according to the statutes in force.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this a bit surprisingly, even though it is estimated that the statutes of the Election Order comply most of all candidates to Pelt.
"I wish it had been voted as far as the statute was."
"To not think of any ethical nonsense like the last General Meeting," the owner, Viktorie Plzeň, who runs for the first time, was mainly directed against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburg, according to him, the new President will be known and believed that candidates will be constructively collaborating in the future.
"All passion will calm the possible practice of the national team today at the European Championship."
"Fotbal will again be on a happy wave, more willing to work together," says an applenic activist, who has three of the greatest experience in managing football both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more resilient.
"I hope in a deal, but unfortunately the situation is a lot broken up."
"It's not between the Czech and Moravia people, but there are attempts to adapt the regulations."
"That may cause the blocking of the general pile to come again."
"But I hope that he will win a healthy sense," said Rajchl.
There is no longer a lot of time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some meetings were supposed to happen directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete in the game.
The air special, in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among other things, the vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not leave from Prague because of the technical disruption in the morning, looking for a replacement variant, how to transport part of the executive committee into the barrier scene.
Eventually, a decisive meeting at the ministerial level may be held on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Joseph Dobes would like to make the parties broken inside the strongest sporting association in the country to a deal.
In the game there is a lot: state subsidies, the credibility of football, as well as the planned general meeting of the ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of the rate.
The Package is in the fight for the President because he can't see the right candidate
If the Chief of Footballists of Plzně Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have signed up for the highest function.
"If the quality adept exists, I fight for him and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one could find such a thing," said ČTK Pall.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, the motivation of Pelt's alleged favorite elections is to prevent the FAČR in its way.
The Package also stresses that, in the case of its victory, it would only last until 2013, when there is a regular general meeting on the programme.
In the function he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected to football.
"I spoke to some people who would consider it."
"For me, it was crazy when some said that at this moment they wouldn't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change the look like this," he said.
He said that Pelt's connection with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation known as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general meeting.
It's so unacceptable for Pelta to stand in the presidency position.
"If he won, the current state is booked and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with Berbra's support, a good businessman, it wouldn't make it any better," said Paclík.
It also suggests that Pelt's name was mentioned in the outbreak years ago in the investigation of a corruption affair, but Pelta came out of which he went out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how we would also look in the eyes of the UEFA and the FIFA," said Paclík, but he's already taking over his former statement that "sales the Pilsen club if Pelta became president."
In the event of a quarterly election triumphing, Pelta could imagine future cooperation.
Similarly, another candidate Rajchl, which Paclík supported before the glaring general meeting ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him like the boss of the representation."
"But managers couldn't manage the association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't do it," said Pallík, who, in September, raised great attention by standing behind the appeal of the board of arbitrators in the forehead with Ludzka Macela, whom Dagmar Damková replaced.
The box says he'd be in charge of the Troufl Association.
It appeals to its ability to manage private companies, since last summer, she has also been in charge of Plzni, who celebrated the premiere league triumph with his support in May.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to his particular cultivation."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which may tend to affect the disciplinary and appeal committee, which deals with disgusting situations," said Paclík, who do not have their antipathies, for example, to the spartanic boss Daniel Křetínsky.
One of the priorities would also consider the stiffening of the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would use the politicians to lobby for getting more money into sport from lottery tax.
"It's one of the key things the new president should take care."
"If there is a gambling taxation, as the political parties declare, I understand their argumentation, but they have to say where the money will go," he said.
As a burden, Paclík does not take either his connection to the Pilsen club, even though he himself claims that the Chairman of the FAČR should be "persistible".
Pelta is connected again with Jablonce, Rajchl with Prague Duklou.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any sense in moving my shares back to someone undercover at the Pilsen club, and in a year and a half back there," said Paclík.
Pelta promised the new FAČR statutes to rule out the election floor
Two days before the General Football Association, one of the candidates at the President of Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the event of the election, it would prevail that the FAČR should have new statutes, which would ultimately eliminate disputes over the election order in the future.
The Jablonian functiononist is an optimist before the fourth meeting in Nymburg, and he believes that the preselection fight will significantly suppress the possible success of the football representation today.
Pelta, no longer before the lighting election, promised that it would be worth focusing on representation and acquisition of funds in the event of the election.
He decided to go to the last minute to the election before the last General Meeting, so he could have a two-month postponement to defend his ideas about football management and present in a wider context.
"The people at all levels have been doing football for a long time, expecting the president to be known on Thursday."
"It feels that it is the highest time for someone to lead the association," says a man, who is primarily linked to the apple club, but who has worked in the Sparta and executive committee of the union for many years.
That is why he believes that he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that the current election problems are the euphoria that was ruled at the time of Ivan Haška's government.
"The Lord at the Red General Meeting has been approved by statutes that have not been as perfect as everyone believed."
"If there were no different interpretations, we had the chairman since September," Pelta warned.
Just recasting the most important document of the civil association, he took the message to delegates.
"If I become Chairman, I will take this as a personal task and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a basic thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He says he's still trying not to define against his opponents.
He had already examined that he could imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchl, which he recognized for his legal education, and knows that his anti-and-and-aidant would be his first vice-president.
For a long time, he didn't attack Tomáš Paclík, who did not leave a string dry on Pelt.
"He's been moving in football over a year, he's got some successes."
"But his attacks were disrespectful, and a lot of people in the way the election campaign surprised."
"That is why a number of them now doubts his true character," said Pelta's opponent's address, which remains faithful to the prophecy, which he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, he believes, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competition to representation.
That should be the interpreting wardrobe of football.
"And I would also try to end all the affairs starting with the cause of Bohemians or the sound of the last year's corruption scandal."
"Now, I'd go to a meeting with the private and state sector to secure enough money for the entire football," the CTU said a sixty-four-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his coming to the forehead of football would not mean any personal cleaners.
"I must first meet the filling of individual employees," said Strahov, where a comprehensible nervousness is dominated by long-term control.
Despite the recent catastrophic scenarios that lead the general meeting, they believe that they will not go to Nymburg on Thursday.
"If it's the only point in question, how will he vote in the third round, we can move over it."
"Photbal needs credibility, and he only gets it by finally having his leader again," Pelta remains two days before maybe the decisive day of his functional career optimist.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR would start working hard under him
If the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected at the fourth General Meeting, the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the Association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises to work hard in the case of his permission.
He wants to promote systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the bail of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work that the previous President Ivan Hašek began.
"I'd like to take part in football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything by myself," Rajchl said in an interview for the CTU.
"I'm a team player and I want to divide the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member can deal with certain areas."
"And I'm going to hand out hard tasks to move football a mile forward in every segment."
"I guess many people wouldn't like it because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was thinking of not running again.
"I know I do 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it's gonna make sense, and that I'm not going to have people behind me who will keep throwing sticks under my legs and questioning every step of mine," he explained why he he was hesitating.
"But many people told me I shouldn't give up because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He says he's motivated by the continued work he started with Hash.
"In those two years, there's been a lot of work to do, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are start-up processes that may have anxiety in a few years, and I would not like someone to stop them," said the fears that, in the event of the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelty, the situation of the union could return to the time before Hashek.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's what I think Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him, people who would have done football so that they'd only be chosen for the ones."
"I can blame a lot of things, but certainly not that I'm strangled."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be well and not just the choice," said Rajchl.
It also argues that he would only be the Czech President.
"If some people try to say the opposite, then I'm planning on making maximum for Morava."
"For example, it is time to think that the second league would split into the Czech and Moravian part whose winners would go to the first league."
"It would not have been such a current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," said Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík joined the fight for the President, Rajchl does not care to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me for my vice-president and sees that I am behind me a clear success," Rajchl, who considers its success to save tens of millions of crowns in disadvantaged contracts, to negotiate television contracts and to negotiate aviation law.
On the contrary, he's being involved with the union not pulling one rope.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from returning to Czech football trust", the other of the opponents of Paclík is considered to be a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If he was elected, he might have continued the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not substantially change the personal assignment in the committees."
"He wouldn't cripple it for his own benefit," says Rajchl rivaly.
The most beautiful pools of Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
The Ufon's view brouzdaliště, a fancy swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after visiting towns or travel to let his tired legs rest in the thermal spas.
The book will show where the wellness is most beautiful at the water.
When Iris Meder appeared in the past one and a half years on the discovering roads, it could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
A lieutenant on the water, looking up to the height of artistic shaped domes, swim against the marble steeps (I'm building a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) that waited at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restaurantd seaboards.
If she liked a plumber, she put it in her notebook, even with remarkable details of the way the building was built and history.
More than 200 plumbers examined this way the historian of the architecture of Meder and presents them now in their book "Badefreuden (Badefreuden (The Ratness of Swimming) ": People's floating plants in Munich, historical palaces of floating in Schwarzwald," the hard core of concrete buildings in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Test to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited the localities in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the floating culture.
He doesn't get too much of a sport, he says Meder, it's just in the water, it's something else.
It's just that fand swims must be satisfied with blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while health runners can breathe an amazement of stink forests or listen to a merry swelling of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the spiders must always be so stunning," she says in Vienna living Mrs. Meder.
"So I started gathering nice spirals."
Water level doubles architecture
Scouting in the jumping pool and etheric oils for sauna - the factor of comfort is therefore so big that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be floating with a real sleeve for the eyes: "The town of the floor has a man in the bath water level."
"But it is transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high cluster, varied tiles, jumping board.
The Maloformate Image Bundle "Badefreuden (Swimming Raffeuden)" provides on 190 pages all that needs to be known about architectural and cultural history of the wellnes historical oase - stimulates, but primarily the taste of jumping in blue.
An extraordinary specimen discovered Mrs. Meder's collector during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful spas like 100 years old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water with a nitrate content in the original lake cave (a cave spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the building shape of bottles (Varosi Termalfürdö in Jaszberen).
On the other hand, many heated floating areas are offered under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has a curysh seaside swimming pool in the eyes of the entire town, he can look at the snow covered by Arlberg - and: In steam baths there is a window from which you can watch traffic at the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool expects spa guests in Längenfeld: Askark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From three top open pelviss in winter, couples grow up while in the background of the mountain Ötztalu stands to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not every swimming pool collector grew up in Mrs. Meder's smell of boilers.
Many thermal baths feel after the sulphur, in the spas in the Hungarian Békescsab, it smells like heating oil to the extent that you barely believe that he got into the healing spa.
The smell comes from medicinal water with alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose habitats slim on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - somewhat special wellness experience.
However, one place Iris Meder was disappointed in its search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate bath Luhačovice, she hit a closed terrain.
In 1902, the spa proposed by architect Dušan Jurkovich was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the falling windows with red and white and yellow secession buildings, she saw how the weeds grow significantly between tiles.
The destruction was built in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three stages of construction; a person can discover not only the New Year's Elements, which come from the time of its creation in 1844, but also the Maurice Hall in Alhambra style, which was attached around 1900.
Since careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal is a popular spa skiller of the pools of Mrs Iris Meder, not only because of Schwarzwald.
"It's already some performance, connecting so diverse building slohs to such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, the thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agriculture speculation
Deutsche Bank allows us to check the commodity store
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann entrusted the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, then, the boss of the company wants to cause consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of the Germans consider one study unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials as wheat or maize.
Two thirds even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this trade because the poorest problems of the world are deepened.
This is the result of the Surveillance Forsa's mandate of the Foodwatch Consumer Organisation.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets at global commodity exchanges are pushing prices to the height and therefore the banks carry together on the world's hunger problem.
Consumer protectors campaign is directed specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
The commodity bets were originally meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, however, most experts agree that the capital market participants with a high-risk interest in high-risk trades have declined from supply and demand - and have reached the poorest profits on the account.
Other than the competitors in the United States, he responded to critic Ackermann: He promised that he would check out the statements and said that no business "not worth having a good reputation given by Deutsche Bank in a bet".
According to the information, SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the international working group from Foodwatch-Report.
The check is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank's board - together with a recommendation on how to be loaded with it.
By the end of January, the bank leaders want to communicate the consequences of the bank.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann works by helping his image.
The Head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his critique of the financial sector: "The planting on rising food prices shows particularly drastic, how the banks, inevitably today, harms general welfare."
Make Ackermann the highest bank lobbyist stand by.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items for which money is used for bets on food prices", said Bode.
"I don't care if Mr Ackermann is a hunger or a reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears at first sight as surprising, but it's clear that the company boss a few months before leaving the office would like to leave the perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the supervisory board.
Reversing from disputed aggressive speculation could improve its image.
And maybe he doesn't have to worry about the loss - he should finally consult his successor.
Any other investment in raw materials would have forfeited
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published anket, in which the Institute of Forsa on 7 and 8 November asked 1001 people.
According to this, eleven percent is legal that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to food prices.
Many customers would also have had personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such trades: each other would, as a result of the survey, voted out all the investments in which the money was spreading into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn the well-known of such a bank, 49 percent indicated that he was thinking about the discontinuation of his account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy end: the Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 extracted the prices, became in Vienna Museem, remained empty and deserted.
It is now opened again as a exhibition house.
When he's horned for modern postwar architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, brave mobs and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a glorious and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture behind his light and high-powered steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of current architecture.
He celebrated the architect by building a pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-layer BMW plus as a key made by the side building in Munich, 1973 was internationally famous.
His as a temporary construction projected pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (Jižn Station), reconstructed and opened the Museum of the 20th century in 1962 - it was named "The House of the 20th century".
But the museum was not suitable for the building, neither spatially nor technically - the walls were missing for hanging artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
Yet, it was used until the present art was reached in Vienna's new stand.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the name "The House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Arts.
On Tuesday night, Museum Belvedere opens the palace, which belongs to, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in any respect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historian of art with a prominent career, i.e. in a young shrine, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museu and as the founding director of Musea moderny Salzburg, gave a strong reconstruction with politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsor money and determined utilisation.
In addition to contemporary art, works by the sculptor Fritz Zruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a cafe and bookshop should be created, and a office building had to be built for it.
Surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the perfect assignment.
Not only did he reconstruct and expand the seasonal constructions of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was a "immediately important place" where he looked at the exhibition.
He also knew the original project and knew the problems of the building, which, when he moved to Vienna, lost its generosity and lightness to change the use.
During this reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was a "capacity for energy", says Krischanitz.
Window profiles of glass facades have been replaced, used glass fibers reinforced with insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold steel bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos filled with ceilings sanated.
Two floors provided a place for new use, an abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, the entrance leads bridge - almost new construction, but still a noble Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance doors remained preserved, the building is wiped in an old anticorrosion red brown color tone.
And the cinema is even the same as it used to be.
And all this for strict surveillance of the memory office and low budget.
"It must have been often found material which is good and cheap and also liked the monumental office", says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was hard to say with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, typical "Drop-in-the-City-historia".
Such architecture says "everything in the wrong place" and still wants to "be appropriate self-esteem".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in a slight place because there has been a urban happy coincidence: In the area around Schweizer Garten there is a completely newly designed "Měsťov čtvrti near the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: the House of the 21st century could receive support from other Krischanitz buildings, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as it is heard, he is already dealing with the city of neighbourhood at Schweizer Garten's station.
Railway is planning a package for the winter crisis in a million-dollar amount
The railroad has flooded a crisis plan to prevent train crashes in the winter period.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than €70 million in the report this year.
The newspapers "Bild" brought a preliminary report on the appeal to the internal market plan that it was expected to count by 2015 with investments of around EUR 300 million.
It is supposed to be achieved by better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external staff of 16,000 persons to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to dispose of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary blasts during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the chief warned the Drah Rüdiger Grube after meeting at the highest level with the leaders of the government and industry before train failures and delays during this year's winter.
During the last winter period, the track had significant problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, there was a lack of reserves.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years to approve the Joint Railway Authority.
In addition, the delays for the transport of ICE trains are accepted.
For years, the road has also been unable to make it easier to allow the ICE train repairs more often to check when one ICE train took place at Köln Main Station to destruct the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million fine in the US
After the start of the head of Joseph Ackermann, there are new trampops in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of compensation.
As if there were no problems at home, Deutsche Bank has reached its past in the United States: the Frankfurt institution pays 145 million dollars in one compensatory procedure (106 million euro) in order to settle disputes due to bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage leaves.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator notes a number of large banks that cooperative banks have made false promises to buy financial products; that they have probably reduced the risks.
Such papers have lost considerably in value during the crisis and the banks have struck with each other in the misfortune.
"We are pleased that we could solve the subject without having to drag the parties into court," said the spokesman Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the valuation of both cash institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the US and helps bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to obtain a compensation for the billion damage caused.
Now ended settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also fell to other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
This is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American real estate bubble broke in 2007, it became a number of financial companies fateful.
In September 2008, the U.S.-Investmentbank of Lehman Brothers changed her thoughts at the top of the financial crisis.
Even though the event took place a few years ago, it now blows up a sharp wind to banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous action to achieve remedies or to undermine doubts.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It sets out 18 international large banks that two state-owned US financers dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's real estate in mortgages of about $200 billion disadvantaged.
Also, Deutsche Bank must face the FHFA lawsuit, there are more shops at the total value of around $ 14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Surveillance Authority calls for the French Constitution to be responsible for "relevant losses" without mentioning any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and declared that she wanted to defend herself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Buffett's financial guru invests greatly in IBM IT.
Since March, he bought more than ten billion dollars of shares.
So far, the important American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies will only be expected with difficulty.
However, he now read the IBM business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the business.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM offers services primarily and provides computer systems for IT-department of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered to be a knight in the financial world.
As a result, the mathematical IT mining IBM can be called now "Sir IBM".
For Buffett said in the U.S. economic radio station CNBC that he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagte, he didn't even know IBM about his engagement yet.
He praised the management that he tried for the economic crisis even for proper returns.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time for lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than a 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice and performance computers for companies.
Buffett's been avoiding technology companies until today.
It claims that it only invests in undertakings whose activities also understand.
Instead, Buffett was hit by the freight railway, after the manufacturer of lubricants or the machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 own subsidiaries, including large-scale shares such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60th century and built one of the world's most valuable investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cultivative figure for many investors around the world.
His almost uncomfortable sense of money making brought him a nickname "Orakel of Omaha" (Orok of Omaha).
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM shares increased by one percent before the storm started.
"Big Blue", as also referred to as IBM, has a total price of more than 220 billion dollars on the exchange and is treated with Apple and Microsoft for the most valuable technology businesses in the world.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to get in.
Bill Gates' founder is his confidential friend.
The threat is intact.
After exploring "Buňka in Zwickau" the Turkish media have doubts about the German law.
The news even speaks of "blood ideology", which is now resenting.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist right-wing background.
To this report, Turkey and inside the German-Turkish population in Germany responded to fear and concerns.
For for many German Turks are returning the scarecrow, which has long been considered dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
However, there was never doubt in Germany.
However, the renowned right-wing extremist network reveals the scope of which the dimension is no longer possible to be seen.
"Reaffirms bloody ideology?" the titles of the online edition of Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The news "Sabah" emphasises, on the other hand, that one of the perpetrators should have been a secret police officer for the Constitutional Protection Department and fear that German authorities could also be involved in the right-hand radical swamps.
The Turkish municipality has strongly responded to Germany: she remembered about the weekend demonstration of silence against the Brandebury gate of the victim of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish politicians, had a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-ture recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, a common life was inspired - as a history of success.
As a box, there are reports of several Turkish media: "A gift from Germany to 50" is the title of the article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the "Hürriyet" letter for Germany cannot take it to avoid this thought-related connection.
"It's starting to smell," the title of the column from Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who were murdered were taxpayers and their work brought an important contribution to Germany's recovery.
The most critical is discussed in the German Internet forums, the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why hadn't the German authorities hadn't attacked much earlier in order to search for the suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus many are demonstrated rétorically compelling to use drastic means: "If the activity is being carried out here so smoothly, there will be nothing other than its own defense and armed."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and proportionality of punishing the entire network is very much dependent on internal peace in Germany, writes "Selen".
What means, if the internal peace in Germany is at risk, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
Photography burning site in Solingen is deeply greed in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has revealed to the Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that disbelief and distress can lead to right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made the Turks a more apparent sense of mutuality.
Do Not Repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the German policy failure after the assassins was criticized at that time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen sent a condolences telegram to the Turkish State President, but he left himself at a sad event in Köln to replace his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech then calculated what fees the Turks had paid.
It's kind of like the value of a man is measured by the height of his taxes.
The current intelligence of Turkish media shows once again how deep the disbelief of many German Turks in the local state-owned arrangement is.
In addition to the efforts to clarify extensively and to re-evaluate the right-hand extreme terrorism in Germany, this time, it requires open words.
Scandal Bank at Curyšsky Lake
The most expensive bank of Europe has no headquarters in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS suffered almost bankruptcy for the financial crisis and has since been slipping from one crisis to another.
Now some Germans have to compare it.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
Following his smooth departure from the Head of the Federal Bank, he became known in July to take 2013 into almost the same spectacular new employment: President of the Governing Board of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praised Switzerland for his beauty and UBS for her newly acquired solidity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has made a turnover."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would go completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London ran around all bank security systems and died about EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the UBS board of Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland a recognized banker, had to leave.
The President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been as burned since then - and everyone asks, "When is Axel Weber finally coming?"
It has become known that Weber Bank has been able to advise since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Management Board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he'd definitely need a time to work.
At the same time, he will take responsibility for the Bank's strategy that has once again proved to deserve the title "Bank of the largest scandals in Europe"
For the UBS is huge - until recently the greatest property manager in the world - and, however, it has been slipping for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to be spared by the Swiss proud bank.
It started for the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also a clever property manager is combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, the UBS 2007 was managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 billion more money for overseas clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank to the league of the world's largest banks.
That was an impression.
A former banker and later a long-term professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "I have always referred my students to UBS as a model to a good bank."
"In today's view, a person asks, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was the first time obvious that something was wrong in UBS.
In the mid-year he resigned surprisingly the director of the Board of Directors Peter Wuffli, which has yet been considered to be a highly intelligent, and also a brilliant banker.
In a few months later, there was a clue why he left.
The bank's investment division was killed by the subprime-paper and had to write down billions.
In order to stop it, the UBS's capital increase was actually 13 billion francs.
At the same time, it has actually found investors, but such that the nose would have been inflamed by recently: the incredibly Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that man could not even learn his name.
But it was just the first hit.
It's been worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to acknowledge new billion losses, President of the Management Board of Marcel Ospel, the second best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood due to its misunderstanding investment in the financial crisis before collapse and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank has purchased from UBS for dozens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs to compulsoryly convertible bonds for which it could become the co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such a large bank on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We could not save the UBS one more time," says the banking expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe is the second one.
For several months, UBS has surrendered in a tax dispute with America and has shown the willingness to issue data for overseas customers who, if possible, shortened taxes by means of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return to unlawful profits from these trades, including a fine cut.
This granted UBS more or less openly that it helped to corrosive taxes.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: a sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what was before.
Followed the resignation of the head of the board and President of the Board of Directors.
And the customer's exodus of money.
Thus, the bank has lost its credibility within a few months in both central trading areas: In investment banking due to bad speculation and in the management of property to help cope.
And just when it got a little calm, just when the UBS thought she recovered again, this unfortunate business anaerobics comes here: the only dealer was vanishing EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed something wrong.
And it's clear: with the management of the risk in investment banking, it's probably still not working.
"In the case of Adoboli, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Banking Institute of Zürich.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that he can't control the risks."
At the same time, it was exactly the idea of carefulness, with which Swiss bankers stepped up a long time ago to become guardians of the great property of the world: no too big risk, for money security - also from this side the Alpine Republic has collapsed the world.
The safes of the Swiss banks have become a symbol for insecure reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché good Swiss private bank - is just a little bigger.
The location's classical.
Banka has its main headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyš Lake, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, trade rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
Klenotnictví like Tiffany's here will be found between Swiss traditional shops as Sprüngli's sugar shops.
For centuries there are Swiss banks: from Nationalbank through Palast der Credit Suisse to an elite private bank such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall enters with heavy rotating doors.
Inside there are walls surrounded by the marble, there is a mighty leather chair, next to the bank logo a large direction to the "seifo".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss banks both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - suppressed or betrayed as the boss finds one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not read in the papers, eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both large banks of business.
The UBS is probably getting too bigger, finding out - especially in investment banking, where Anglosas expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything to say anymore.
"And if they had, they'd adapted in an English way."
Indeed, it was anglosaic investment banking that changed the UBS, brought her high profits first and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost so much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"In the midst, a small seven-milion country coalition fell asleep for the greatest rescue event in his nation's history," writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save bankruptcy from a large bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you speak to Swiss bankers, you can see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a powerful company.
The bank, which was already too large for small Switzerland, has emerged and has continued to grow.
At the same time, it helped both different bank predecessors of the UBS were added: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a mining in the management of property and poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came to a lot of money that could make a big ruler.
With this rise in UBS, two names are connected: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Management Board from 2001 to 2007.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the future team," says the bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, man controlling feelings around the stomach, which came from bank science completely up."
But Ospel said to the end, he relied on Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He probably thought his models were real," he says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
Obviously, pride preceded the fall.
Employees of the UBS are clearly remembering the possessions of managers, on which Wuffli's boss repeated the same password again: Beat Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She referred to "League Tables", an orderlist that documented the success of the bank that time.
In it UBS was trying to set up the top.
She's done a few steps before.
She participated in the exchange shop and with the stock completely upwards.
However, business advisers who have been mandated highlight one weakness: in international interest trade, in the speech of bankers "Fixed Income", probably there is a large distance behind the largest banks.
UBS has probably gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, the UBS decided to make an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and its fund based on risk-procurement in the US Subprime investment.
She developed in a massive machine that repacked valuable papers to US mortgage loans and passed on - but also kept himself at risk.
Also, when the other banks were searching for an exit.
"At the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says the bank expert Geiger.
How big the eupheria is, so deep down.
One manager after another had to leave when attempted to clean up was more difficult than he thought.
The UBS positions became a catapulting seat and until today with a swing.
Whoever runs a large bank now has almost invincible work.
They must find a strategy for banks that all close business models have disappeared.
Geiger's banking expert already has an idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
As far as the bank does not want to go.
But the investment banking is supposed to take a hard time, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the Sergio Ermotti bank wants to introduce its future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually understood only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he said: He's supposed to run UBS business for a long time, the curysian bank has communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3500 seats down.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking.
But publicly, he says only that he will find his lady first in Zurich's apartment.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe is suffering from a storm in the United States.
The threatened recession in Europe has given American investors the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome has not reached the intended impact.
The damaging production of industry in the Continent has strangled the hope of stabilising the debt crisis.

It imitated investors in the US sceptically. "We are not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, moreover, there are other signs of bank weakness.
The legend of investing Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: He said in one CNBC-interview that it is probably not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks, in its view.
Instead, Buffett left the old principle for several decades and entered the American technology business.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM strengthened the rate of shares of the traditional company and let it against the trend during trade first quote by almost one percent above.

Intelligent crows are expanding in cities
In many places, the polar ravens are regarded as "problem birds": However, from the cities, these highly intelligent animals are no longer released, said experts.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: the crows have been in the picture of the city for centuries, but in some municipalities, there are complaints from the population of impurity and noise caused by animals.
There is no means against "problem birds" yet in sight.
Polar rafts probably can't be out of town anymore, the experts have declared the first symposium on the wrecks in East African Leer.
There were consulted experts from all over the federal territory about possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors have also caused the problems of cities from the exodus of particularly protected field haurans: the use of chemistry in agriculture is likely to destroy traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing construction, and the ducking of typical trees to nest birds makes life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Great colonies with over 600 nest couples are, among others, in the Westphalia Soest, northwest, including Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Breme and Leera.
There, the 2005 contested project of mass killing vran in the rural period was called negative subtitles.
The critics marked the capture of animals into traps for birds and killing sticks especially brutal.
"Normal extortion, crying, nothing brings," so found the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of nests by squirting water or ducking trees has often undesirable consequences, also said the expert on the environment of Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Badensk-Württemberg.
"The animals retreat, the large colonies are squeezing and splitting into other places."
Driving is only thoughtable as an exception to hospitals, homes of pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding territory, the city's problem cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
The combination of evasion of animals from sensitive residential areas and their attraction is thoughtable to settle in other places.
The "Information Table instead of chain saws" promoted, on the other hand, a psycho and ethnic Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different animal treatment: "One heater in the face can ultimately be best discontinued by self-consciousness."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg’s teaching paths, on which the information board of lessons about the life of a highly intelligent Polish havran.
In the meantime, the project is already accepted by tourists.
Also, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion on the noise criticism of the birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say."
Intelligence and creativity of animals are legendary: the field Havrani do not only use the help to achieve the pamelection, but even as a help to make their instrument.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested behaviour on four hemorrhages of the field, how far avian intelligence is reaching.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones had to bring the destruction of the structure to reach the larva of the mole.
Without great training, they knew what size and shape the stone had to have to cause collapses of platforms.
In the second attempt, the wrecked crows had to solve a more luminous problem.
In a vertical cylinder, researchers placed a small container with a larva mola.
The birds couldn't reach their prey.
But the researchers put a piece of wire there.
Of them, all four animals produced a hook, which was used as audition hunting from the tube container for a holding.
Three of the four field raids have even succeeded.

But after the break, the European Vice-President of 2004, with four zones, explained everything.

After this terrible second, Croatia was taking over but still more control.
They didn't even get the Chorvati gate after the break.

Passenger Massacre
The emotionally powerful new book of Peter Englunda entitled Beauty and Sorrow: Trustful history of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of exhibiting figures when you turn your head off.
One advice how to maintain at that moment: Careful to rip this page out and make your bookmarks out of it.
For all people, you will be very familiar with Mr Englunda's novel, and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a beacon - in moments where you will feel confused and lost in various situations as well as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new Deputy at the Swedish Academy, who awards Nobel's literary award.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite awkward, as "antihistoric work".
It contains several very famous names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, almost lacks ambassadors, energy journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, it explains, like, "the book about what it was like." It's mostly about "scites, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Right and grief" combines war experiences of 20 more less than dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, drivers of paramedics and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become war prisoners, lose their limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are mitigated as flames of candles burned in the church - new ones are joined in the fate mix, while others are extinct.
Mr Englunda's book differs from classical historical novels.
He's making the idea that the first world war was just about the horror fears of the West Front.
"Right and grief" is a skillful explorer of other places where war drama occurred: Alps, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, Eastern Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with their bee nests falling on them, must spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or face the presence of tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, this is a very touching reading.
The war will devour people's lives as a natural disaster, like the Hurricane Katrina smelling gunshot dust.
When the gun shooting begins in the distance and you're a woman who's home with your children, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why the entire war was destroyed.
"A vacuum resulting from the lack of facts," noticed Mr. Englund, "it was filled with contempts, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Right and grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and cuffy, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are completely lively and believable.
Many of them talk about spending and coping with him.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "No substitutes, all over the place."
"A coffee substitute, aluminium imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He keeps going and describes substitutes for food in Germany.
It mentions "meas produced from a powdered rice cooked in scotch fat (and supplemented with false bone from wood), tobacco of dried roots and dried potatoes, boots with wooden underwear".
It mentions that there was a "837 registered meat substitute for the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in himself an inner drive to wildness and brutality, but he says about the war: "You'll finally understand that this is the human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarette and whiskey, evening newspapers or good book, and pretending that this mask represents civilization, and that there is no barbar in the inside of the grinding me."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will probably die soon, and no one will notice, let alone mourn.
"When a person finally agrees with sacrifice, at least he would expect it to be before the eyes of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict who's secretly hanging".
Further remarks relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict has become more economic competition and competitive struggle," says Mr. Englund, "the war between the factories."
He captured what he says, "the new kind of beast of the coming century: the pronounced and ideologically impressed mass killer in the dress cut to the peace that he makes his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People act completely unexpectedly, disgrace is changing with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness to avoid serving on the front.
"The most intense example of this behavior was the trade of gonococko rude that soldiers purchased and poisoned with their genitals in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," writes.
"The most despised ones have wiped him into their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their life."
In this Swedish translation from Peter Graves, Mr Englunda's proposition is swift, but no proving, which is great for his human topic.
In dozens of minor outputs, the way the war "distributed completely unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the first World War were mostly rather than a comprehensive story that worked with signs, such as "The First World War and Modern memories" by Paul Fussella or novels like "The Western Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most crushing end that has no similarities in the popular educational literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
But you'll feel like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, took the page out of the list of heroes and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake this time for a minute exactly scheduled event
There were hundreds of police officers in the helmets used in street disturbances.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at the time Zuccotti park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except a few highly built officers, but the others were first said to be exercised.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was leading to the action, whose presence stressed how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
They were not allowed to repeat cases of the last weeks when, for example, pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, which violated the rules of the department and, moreover, the wave of sympathy to the public was spilled on the side of the squatters.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at clearing the Zuccotti Park from demonstrators was initiated after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders have been inspired by operations in other cities.
Massive exercises in case of conduct in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island part, which was preparation for action in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders have strengthened the so-called repression training - anti-terrorist measures involving a rapid transfer of large numbers of policemen - with a focus on the Lower Manhattan City.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park have literally come to a "last-minute" advertisement by someone who was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who were also summoned to this event, and no one said to them that he was going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he would remain anonymous.
"On going to Zuccotti Park, they only knew the maximum position of the members of the department."
One of the reasons for the coverage was the lesson that the city had once received.
On October 14, the city's leaders had the plan to clear the park, but then they moved away from the plan, because when demonstrators heard about it, they were recorded before the operation to the park for hundreds of hundreds.
Tuesday's actions were attended by police officers from different units, including intervening groups from around - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen a quarter with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, he comes to the park and leaves a lot of people, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when there was at least people in the park," he said.
Before the troops went off, they ranked on the borders of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arch lamps and ammplions.
The lights and the recorded news of the amplions frightened many demonstrators.
When the members of the order units entered the park in their blue windmills, many demonstrators packed up their things and left.
The police claim that until 1:45 a.m., she didn't touch a single tent, so she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things.
Other police teams were seen gathering at the edge of the park so they could enter it if there was any arrest needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesperson of the police department Paul J. Browne said that it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to stop them from seeing her units in action, and some police officers treated them roughly.
Mr. Browne claimed that TV cars on Church Street along the west border of the park could be filmed without any problems.
The police proceeded in the west direction and went through a lot of displacement of protesters' personal things, including luggages and igelite bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department, which immediately stole everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park.
The most enthusiastic group of demonstrators went near the kitchen in their campsite, lying near the center of the park.
Some have created a roadblock, and the police have launched their methodological arrest.
About ten people in the center of the campsite joined each other.
And two people tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were summoned to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 a.m. there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, a police statement.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most arrests were made because of "organisation of riotism and opposition in arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, was the most highly built police officer at the scene.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he wasn't involved in the operation," said Mr. Browne.
The second group of police have been waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needs to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, were tied up.
From these places, the police developed a protection belt further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, policemen were seen, many of which were equipped with shields, as people pushed further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people at the north border.
The wildest night's actions were taken south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m., one demonstrator south of Pine Street was spotted, as he jumped on the hood of the police car, and a few others who released the air from the tyres of the police van.
In one minute, a piece of plough came out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, a policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The Department of Assisted Workers will sue the city for release
The departments representing hundreds of school auxiliary workers who lost their work last month on Wednesday are planning to sue the city, claiming that the release was not necessary, and in addition it was discrimination because of an irresponsible impact on schools attending poor students.
There is probably the last possibility left to unions in District Council 37 in their attempt to revoke the decision on redundancy.
On the seventh of October, six hundred seventy school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees of the city. Their release was described by the leaders of the union as a retaliation of the city for not allowing him last spring access to the health care fund managed by the staff of which the city wanted to stick a hole in the budget.
The city's heads have categorically rejected this accusation.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, the Minister for Education said Dennis M. Walcott that discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately contradicted by not specifically talking about the release of assisted workers in the budget.
The Directors of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday they will call a press conference, where they formally notify the action at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the process will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the defendant will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-Americans or hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, the spokesperson of the city's law department, said the city hasn't seen a lawsuit yet, and that's why he's not going to express himself.
According to the suggestion of the complaint that New York Times managed to obtain, the unions focused on the number of people released in the poor part of the city, which wanted to support their claims of unfair conduct, and the view that the poor schools had lost more assistants because they have long been denied enough funds.
They pointed out that while in schools in Staten Island, the upper East Side was not released at all, and in the Upper East Side, at least, in Brooklyn, in the 23rd district in Brownsville, 17 school assistants and in parts of District 8 and 9 in South Bronx were released even 46 assistants.
Reminds that at Public School 36, Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their work, even though it's school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. In the lawsuit, they say, "It's not about neighboring full of movable parents who can provide money to balance the deficit in the budget."
Public School 36 budget has been reduced by 3.26 percent this year and the school has also lost money when the city has changed the way to calculate bonus finances for each declared poor student.
In addition, the departments argue that CEOs could have been confused in a way that was written by a document authorising the release of parent coordinators.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school paylist to the database of available workers whose wage is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," says the motion for a complaint, "and not only moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya.
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to agree on something about the rebellion in Libya.
But before it happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the government dictator Muammar Kaddáfí had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States forces.
On Tuesday, the Senate's Commission will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and American units for "state".
"This statement we want to appreciate the courage of Libyan people who began with the reconstruction of their country," Kerry said.
"Your sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy to date.
During the summer, the legislators from both sides constantly argued between themselves and the White House on the wording of a series of statements for approval or on the contrary, rejecting the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the different opinions of both political parties, so it was never voted for in the Senate.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of American operations in Libya.
This is what the US mission in Libya has become literally in the legislative purify - Congress has criticized the way President Obama's mission is driving, but it obviously did not irritate enough to stop supporting him in his county.
Finally, the convention's vagueness preceded other events.
The Rebels conquered Tripolis in August and on October 20, Kaddafí was killed.
Nato mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now, the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tendencies, which they have put in an effort to free their people" and "approve the men and women of the U.S. forces and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary bravery and professionality."
In the statement, "the national interest of the United States is also confirmed in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Does the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be divided again into two half, as it was when approving the June proposal?
Against the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the representative of the Republican Party in the committee.
Lugar's spokesperson said he hasn't seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
In the House, this week, it will be voted in favour of an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution concerning the budget or other topic to be voted on by the House or the Senate.
The other legislators have not yet been able to push their proposals to vote itself, even through a significant effort.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 supplements to the Constitution, which were presented in the Congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and to the Senate - and others are only small exchanges of others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the addition on balanced budget and another handful that would like to "regulate federal expenses".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast their "authorship".
The statement on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required that the House and the Senate vote in favour of the supplement relating to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of the non-binding declaration to support the creation of such a supplement.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the limitations of the number of periods in which the members of the Congress could serve while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that can be president's office.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements which, among other things, would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an addition that prohibits the marriage of couples of the same sex and a supplement prohibiting the burning of the flag State.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws in the event that two thirds of the States stand against them.
Although it seems that Congress members are very active in designing various additives, they do not seem to have a significant turnover compared to previous years.
At 111. Congress offered 77 supplements while at the 100th Congress was 66.
Their activity even bleds compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when according to the statistics of the Senate Library members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they weren't much more successful than current politicians.
The last addition that was added - the 27th supplement - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was designed by Congress in 1789.
"From beaten, but not defeated," says Gifford in her first television interview from the shooting.
Ten months after she was injured by a shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on a national television on Monday night, she sang together with a melodie from the broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and stated that more than a return to Congress is worth a healing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" show at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the formation of the sentence was still causing her problems and needed help in walking.
The whole show documented her difficult reconvalescence, which was necessary for the injury caused by a bullet that broke her skull in front, penetrated her left half of her brain, and went out of her head.
Three months ago, she was surprisingly returned to the House to take part in the vote on a debt ceiling.
During her first TV interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and she described her recovery as "true".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she answered the 14-year-old Giffords, "That was pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly speciality of the show "20/20", which was broadcast in the preday edition of the new book of this couple, called "Gabby: Aspect of courage and hope".
The specialist followed the whole Gifford reconvalescence from the shooting on January 8th.
In the videos that Kelly filmed during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more at the time than just pick up one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapist teaches her how to do simple activities.
Head-screw.
lips pumped.
And then, her first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords said another word - "toast" when she asked for changes in her breakfast.
The videos of the ABC stations have shown that the major role for the recovery of Giffords played music: the Congressman is singing on them together with a therapist on a melodie to the song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, which is two hours a day's therapy, Sawyer said she didn't remember anything from the day the shooting took place.
Her husband said that Gifford reads the papers about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who was the six who was killed in the incident.
From the shooting, the suspect Jared Lee Loughner is detained in Missoury prison, where under the influence of the drug abuses awaits a trial.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Great, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said, "I lost."
"So I just said, Gabby, you didn't lose," he described Kelly.
"You just got caught up.
But you can do it, you'll get together, and you'll come back even stronger than ever."
Military forces meet more sympathy than respect.
The event was a gala party on Wall Street, who delivered millions of dollars for war vets in New York, who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
There were hundreds of soldiers, sailors, flyers and marines around him.
The celebrityly dressed crowd rose up and thrilled enthusiastically.
"Muges and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
The chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff also attended the festive evening. Apart from it, Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military forces slightly differently.
"They were all imagined as some orphans," wrote an e-mail officer.
I'm sure the organizers thought it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect.
So the completely opposite impressions are just illustrated by the light relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
Military is extremely included by praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if the individual in uniform regrets.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, commanding units in Iraq and leaving Afghanistan soon.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or messy with the public they serve.
They also realize that anger, which had to face the forces returning once from Vietnam, was much worse.
As a result, most of the words of pity are spoken in silence and in privacy between the veterans of war.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from the battle events where they served as members of the marine corpse, their father warned them that their service would be viewed by people outside the army from two angles.
From some point of view, it will feel respect and amazement because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But another one will drill his head if "under the surface does not hide an evil, violent veteran," said Cancian, who participated in the fights in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who interviewed him were irrelevantly suggesting that soon after returning with the fight could resist the stress that is connected to the work in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," he taught Cancian to your sons.
Particular concern of the army from American indifference to wars.
The successes in the battlefield will only rarely reconcile the recognition in a country that has only a small awareness about its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are very little of its own benefit.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as we used to be in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded American units in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in a gun.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of events that they persevered, the number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces a growing pressure to hit hard against rape
This week will decide whether 28 women and men against the Army will be initiated in the case of rape.
If not, they're ready to file a lawsuit with hundreds of other applicants.
The first class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was the night she was allegedly raped to her military colleague, 25 years old, and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008, and she headed to the cascades at the Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend, she ran into her male companion box with 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her for a drink in her room.
"I had a warning light on my head," she described Lyman.
But the native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I could listen to my instincts."
He claims that just a few minutes after they walked into her room, a man walked into her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict of hearing that might have historical impact. This will be held in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be held before the court.
The accusation states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to combat the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The defendant was filed in February by the Washington Lawyer Susan Burke and the defendant had 17 members at that time. However, during the following months, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men claiming that they were raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army, after the notification of these attacks, failed in the investigation, punishing any hunt for justice.
Burke claims that he's going after his neck to the highest army leaders, because the problem is starting with them.
"Arms is a direktive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in position to prevent the introduction of measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that, since February, she contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of which could become part of other complaints lodged in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than gathering all the charges in this case - she puts all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she will file lawsuits in more cases if the pressure is needed.
The Defence Department's Defence Team shall be led by the U.S. Attorney of the United States of America, Neil MacBride, who, together with its coworkers, has lodged an action to reject the case.
The documents that Newsweek has acquired are in detail discussing the defence strategy - in principle, it is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court's order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injury concerns military service of the defendants," writes in the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.
However, things have changed since the '50s.
Even though women are still not officially allowed to serve in the fight, it is just words: in modern wars it is hard to find clear front lines.
In wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers have played a more significant role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female sex soldiers fell between these wars - two thirds of them directly in the fight.
It's time for the military to be upgraded, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except for her, another three legal attorneys are involved.
At Yale law school, visitors are preparing a veterinarian seminar on legal services of a lawsuit for four major military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of the U.S. veterans gathers the grounds for its action against the Army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of the "fighting personality" that was allegedly identified in the victim of rape to have an army of an excuse for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, belonging to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a completely common practice.
In December, its group has already filed a motion against the State Organization for dealing with veterans, accused of discrimination practices that should have occurred in the processing of applications for assistance by persons claiming that they were sexually attacked in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in the Congress by the Senators and Members of both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010 for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence.
However, this type of attack remains in most cases undeclared and according to its own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In the report published in March, the rate of criminal prosecution of suspects is also addressed: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army were received in 2010 - which is half of the civil judicial system.
The applicants in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumas.
For example, first-class militia Lyman reported a alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to the different police members, doctors and commanders.
She took all the tests necessary to determine the rape and her bed was found blood from the attacker's wound that she did on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman received a hearing before the court during which questions about whether she was in love with her friend on the day of her attack.
Six persons were summoned to be witnesses of the reputation in favour of a alleged offender who was ultimately guilty.
"I remember the day the judgment was taken," says Lyman.
"I had the feeling that I would be born right there - with the screaming I ran out of the courtroom."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I said to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial, he was mine."
The Lymans have been ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed personality disorder, indicating her inappropriate to serve.
In January 2010, the army was freed without honor, and therefore without entitlement to service.
Whether Lyman's case moves into another phase or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington's law school.
Of course, he notes, "from my point of view, they should be able to proceed to another phase of discussion."
But among them and the verdict, the doctrine that has been criticized since the first time the light of the world has seen.
I myself am a lifelong critic of Feres Doctrine's doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their duties do not comply with the same level of incentives and distressing resources.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only occur when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in favour of them, Burkevoa, the lawyer of the applicants, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a lawsuit and start working on other causes relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, where reform will not come from," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes sooner.
The walls have eyes: As scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-migrational opinions on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to a July murdering bargain, after which 77 dead were left in Norway, took part in his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was definitely not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on the computer while preparing the attack, chatting with some of the million nationalists supporting the right-wing group on social networks.
After the tragedy this year, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy enough to get on Facebook.
"We realised that it is not that hard to get," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of the report recently published by the British Research Team, which concerns European digital populism.
The supply of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, Bartlett says that scientists have been sufficient to simply use the advertisement on the site and, thanks to the absolute accuracy, they have determined the wanted demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe has found half a million right-wing fans, which focused on them and sent them out ads, but instead of bringing them into a new group or offering them some dietary products, called for them to fill out the questionnaire in which questions relating to the level of their education, violence and optimism have occurred in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of conducting research," notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are a village of young men, which inspires a growing degree of immigration.
But on the other hand, "they who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who are constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and politician researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends that hide with the updates of the states, contributions in the walls and presses "I like".
Facebook reports over 800 million active users on average. Each of them will provide three different data on average, which makes this social network literally "informative supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic work in which the Facebook word is being named, increased compared to the situation five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the Facebook spell in giving them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them somewhere on the street.
"Sometimes, when you wanted to conduct a survey between the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a side where they would never let you go," says Bartlett.
"This is all Facebook messing up - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify social and health problems and avoid them.
In the recent study of Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken Facebook outputs were much more threatened by the problem of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about this topic.
Moren suggests that students monitor the website and come with the offer of help to a student who publishs too many drunken status.
"The problem cannot be solved if you cannot diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Dr Moren and Director of the Centre for Health, behaviour and development of children at the Child Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify the threatened children that we wouldn't have a chance to discover."
Facebook himself constantly surveys the data of its users.
The information team of the website has developed statistics on relations status and day of St. Valentine's Day, election participation in 2010 and the coefficient of national satisfaction (mainly using the information to which they had access - Internet freedom supporters have long claimed that the website should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the website is watching, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, it is necessary to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. On-line data are accessible to everyone.
"I didn't even think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, a 2006 study conducted using the public facebook walls of his students.
"If it was them, they took the information only between them and their friends."
Following this, it is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook there is no possibility to verify how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing outside of Facebook is two totally different things," explains Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwin, who has spent the research of new technologies for years, believes that pencil and notebook continue to remain the best possible instrument that can be used in research.
"When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Community research should be about society and social activities - and hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public court trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to committing two attacks during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway during his first public court hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of "resolution".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among Norwegian templar knights," said in front of the court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court, because you have a mandate to give you an ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I admit to my actions, but I don't admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monology because "he didn't want to give Breivi the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could report his views."
For the same reason he refused to speak to Breivik, allow the relatives of his victims to address at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Breivika in custody for the next 12 weeks, forbid any contact with the media for 4 weeks and announced that the competent authorities will have full control over all their visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 related victims and survivors.
Some came to hope that they would be able to look Breivik into the eyes, others to make sure they were held firmly under the lock.
All of them participated in order to move the case to early closures.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said the NRK commentator one of the survivors' attacks.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw the suspect and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in the dark suit and the blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On coming and leaving to the building without trouble, the view of the journalists and the survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a larger "support movement," the judge said that he was not crazy, and that there was no evidence that he had a partner.
For someone, it may be comforting that the attacks of June 22 appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish that she would fall out as a monster, but that's not it," the relative of one of the victims said.
"If I did, everything would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to a movie this week
Once Steve Jobs died on October 5th, the opinions of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and chose him for his genius the greatest modern inventor.
The recently rediscovered Job's interview, which was taken up for a special film that heads to the cinema this week, will be the fact that all Apple fans have perfectly understood its creative mind with business processes and workflows worth of their products.
He was a wonderful designer, dreamer and a single member of hippie movement, but also a pedant organizer and a man who, every detail, believed that many entrepreneurs had suffered "such as a really great idea is of 90 percent of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent result product is still a long way of a workhouse."
In 1995, Bob Crickely worked on the TV show Triumf of computer fools who discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the shooting, more than an hourly conversation took place.
At that time, it was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands working with his new computer NeXT, and he was patiently looking at how a wide public would accept the internet.
In the TV show, only a short part of the whole Crickely interview was used and the original copies of the interview were traditionally lost in transport.
However, shortly after Jobs' death, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
Just this material, slightly cut off, form the base of a 68-minute shot of Steve Jobs: A lost interview that heads to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has proclaimed his inclination to provide longer interviews here, Jobs is surprisingly excited to talk about its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking when you can see how Jobs's answer is perfectly thought to be as strong as possible and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’s perfectionism flows to the surface, when Cangely’s questions are impatient and inspiring him to get to more important problems and topics.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhon and appear in it to scary prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and badly, offering its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the postmortem evaluation of Jobs' career, but on Jobs, which we see here as an eager dream in the bloom of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He's got his own vision of how things could and should look.
It did not take long, and after he said his thoughts, he also began to put them in practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How did he learn to drive the company:
"Going years of business, I always asked, "Why are you doing this? And the answer was always the same: Well, that's how you do it."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinks about business stuff deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continue by describing its efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused with the way the costs were recorded - often started with the title of "standard costs", they could only think of their amount. At that moment he decided to take off his own way - developed an automatic tool which guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs during a moment.
How he made the peat on the pope:
Jobs remembers the "Modrou box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively into a phone company and call free of charge anywhere in the world.
The device has been written in the past a series of things, but Jobs' enthusiasm, when the Blue Box describes as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
He tells how they tested the device with Wozniak using a paid phone, and they were able to interconnect from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible during the call.
"At least half a dozen times we got into this circle around the world, so when we screamed something into a paid phone, it got a minute later from the other phone at the door," he laughs.
"We were young, and we found out that we were able to construct a thing that was able to drive a billion dollars worldwide infrastructure."
We made ourselves a small thing that managed to control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I think Apple would never come without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the joke that Wozniak and Wozniak almost got to the end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, and they gave their best for Henry Kissinger.
They were gradually called on as members of the Catholic Church to talk to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before they woke up the pope himself to the phone, the pairs were folded and laid on the headphone.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, and he was looking for spare parts to build a radiator, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I ever met at that time, and it formed my view of what such a society is and how it should behave to his employees."
Later, jobs became one of HP employees who visited a company research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw the first table computer ever produced.
He was big as a trunk, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher in HP, hanging around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How to invent innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about how they make new products for running.
In the beginnings of his career, when he went to sell a couple boards with a platform connection, one customer asked him to build a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, assembled the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he remembers the problems they faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember how wild we were fighting... yelling at me that it would take five years to build a mouse that would cost $300, when it stopped me entertaining, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big company breathes occur:
Long before the resurrection of Apple, Jobs has clearly foretold that many industrial leaders in their vision are turning around and losing their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copys or printers, so what's next?"
You have monopoly on the market, so the company can't be more successful.
At that point, he's already in control of the residency and marketing, so companies are running people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are trained from the decision-making process.
Technological genius, which led the company to its insecure position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have actually owned the whole computer industry.
Could have been ten times bigger than he is, could have been Microsoft's '90s...
But instead of winning, they lost.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
"Mean idea and excellent product is a long journey and a lot of work... and how the great idea is evolving, so it's changing and growing."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You must proceed to a number of compromises - certain things simply electrons, glass, robots or factory do not make.
You must keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Eventually, it depends on taste - you try to think about the best things that mankind has ever created, and in some ways you try to point them into what you do.
Picasso said good artists are copying, but the best artists are stealing.
I've never been ashamed of robbing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poems, artists, zoologists, historical and consistent circumstances as well as the best computer experts in the world.
If they weren't computers and new technologies, they'd do amazing things in other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the opposers of the Healthcare Act at the time their case was dealt with.
The day the Supreme Court settled behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether he would accept objection to President Obama's Health Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attend a festive dinner sponsored by a law firm who will attend the negotiations before the court.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges gathered together to discuss the proposed proposals.
One of the cases discussed was the action brought by 26 states questioning the radical recast of health care, which last year approved by Congress - the law that mobilised conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that the action would be heard, but in March, the 5.5-hour negotiations are expected, which will further develop even more presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in fullstream at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands in front of the court and tries to achieve the refusal of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Prosecutor General of the United States under George W. Bushe.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been engaged in the defence of conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, so-called the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical gigant Pfizer Inc, for which they are at stake in the process huge funds.
Dinner was held in the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court debate on the case.
He also participated in Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republicans in the Senate and confirmed the opposer of the Healthcare Act.
Scalia and Thomas.
This pair of judges with the Federalist Society's actions has been attending for years.
And it's definitely nothing contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct which are subject to a lower federal judge.
However, if this were not, their behaviour would certainly fall under the principle of C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently related and other organisations organized in order to obtain funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorable guest, nor be placed on the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with two legal firms in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was rich enough to report to activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause.
"The judges have been drinking and dinner at social benefit along with the legal representatives waiting to discuss their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in the acquisition of funds through this action undermine the legs by all claims of indifference, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown a great understanding against their critics and have told them that they also have no problem combining their judicial obligations with actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Ginni is a highly constructed conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as the D.A. for President Obama's Government when the first objections against the law appeared in court.
The Kagan critics are pushing her to renounce her participation in the case, and claiming that she was fighting for the law as much as she could now be uninterested.
Kagan didn't indicate she was about to step back.
Boeing has received a record contract on current aircraft worth USD 18 billion
Emirates airlines order 50 two-volume Boeing 777 current aircraft with the possibility of buying 20 others.
Boeing also sells six aircraft Boeing Dreamliner to Aman Air, for which it incurs more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets a order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually not a reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is the manufacturer of aircraft Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aeroplanes is totaling a record USD 18 billion, it is something else.
The same important news is from where Boeing received the contract: the Middle East, the growing gold mine for future orders of aircraft.
According to the forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2 520 aircraft worth $ 450 billion in the next 20 years.
In the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order in history regarding the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-million current Boeings 777.
A sensational contract came from the Emirates' airline located in Dubai.
The company Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show stated that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would result in a total value of the contract amounted to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air's aerolinks ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is proud of significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire company Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to those who spend oil.
This means that they have not only the money to pay for aircraft, but the increase in the price of fuel - mostly damage to airline because it is one of its biggest costs - it is not so decisive because the country itself earns higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could withdraw or postpone orders of aircraft due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have natural protection," he says.
The Emirates Aerolinek order strengthens Boeaing's leading position on the airplane market with a wide hull and brings Airbus SAS to a narrow company, which wanted to attempt to disturb the Boeing dominance with its A350 transport model.
The winner of Boeing comes four months after Airbus' representatives announced that the first flight of their largest aeroplane A350, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER aircraft.
The removal was because the customers demanded more useful loads of the aircraft and a flight, and therefore took time for the manufacturer to supply more power to the engine.
Boeing Co has increased by 1,5% to 67.94 USD.
The sister of the Mexican president was, apparently, defeated in the Michoacan elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon, of the PRI, helped in chasing the governor's chair, drug dealers.
Looks like Felipe Calderon's sister, in violent state elections, lost the governor's post in Michoacan, and she later declared that one of her opponents helped the drug dealers to win.
Preliminary results were ordered by the Governing Council of the West State of Faust Vallej by the Institutional Revolution Party, or by PRI.
"Officts of organized crime members into the entire election process, and especially until yesterday, the election itself is alarming not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a conversation for the radio day after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion survey group, confiscated the election urinate, built road road road road road roads... and let people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico seven decades until 2000 when the Presidency lost.
However, he plans to return to power soon and win in the elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win in July as well as in the presidential elections.
It seems Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led one day before the elections, only very tightly.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to acknowledge Vallejon as a winner.
The third place was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or a PRD that had yet been controlled by the Governing Authority.
Aureoles also refused to recognise preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the State, named Morelia, refuses any relationship with drug dealers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacan has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and metamphetamines.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and in Michoacan, in December 2006, he launched a military fight against traffickers.
However, violence persisted.
The Mayor of the PAN, a follower of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered only a week before the elections, and many candidates from the elections of fear departed.
However, whatever the results of the elections in Michoacan are for the PRI side, the victory of the side will help to get a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington Vallej, congratulated and said, "I think this victory might be very encouraging because of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help with the rescue of the Eurozone before its serious debt crisis, otherwise the global economy could be reduced, which would have a negative impact on the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, the Director-General of the ADB, based in Manile, said that two of the fastest growing economies in the world have to "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or the direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that Bric's states [Brazil, Russia, India, China] all of the European problems are being followed by "extremely undistorted" and declared that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and resources will help to drive the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So everyone who could help Europe from the crisis," said for the Financial Times during a conversation in the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asie may be protected to a certain extent, but certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been seriously investigated for several months.
In recent days, the borrowing costs of Italy have been dangerously raised and the Presidents of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns about the fact that the global economy could retaliate again, and the call started to be called to join the newly emerging front economy and help Eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag foretold that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but pointed out that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds of the Fund for financial assistance from the European Union, the institutions for European financial stability - would provide more negotiating opportunities to Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do what she can" to help Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in export and by drying the flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and unsatisfactory," said.
"We stand before a hard task, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else we could find a job for dozens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indians, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe for 1.2 billion residents of India, when 800 million of them live from USD 2 or less per day.
"One could find out that the Greeks are retired at 50 and enjoying holidays on the beaches, which would probably be difficult to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, the Director-General of the World Economic Forum, has similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well paid employment to many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag emphasized that the crisis of the Eurozone is at risk of a "insecure dominant effect".
The forecast by the bank that there will be 7.5% of economic growth between 2011/2012 and now faces a "risk of decline" due to a European threat.
He declared that vulnerable developing markets must create "unpredictable expenditure plans" in order to be protected from a drop and significant deflection of capital from their economy.
Warning from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the area of defence
The Minister of Defense of Leon Panett in Congress on Monday, he properly added under the boiler when he warned that the rising automatic cuts in the budget could jeopardise national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning in Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend the budget reduction of USD 450 billion in the next 10 years, but now he fears a reduction of another USD 600 billion unless the Congress fails to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," wrote Pantta in a letter to senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach the budget agreement, resulting from the so-called occupancy, will result in 23% of the flat-rate decline and the halt of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, which is used in this unsustainable way, it will not be possible to make most of our construction or shipping projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of buildings or ships. In addition, there could be serious damage to other modernization efforts," wrote Pantta to senators.
"We will be forced to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is to go so quickly, we will almost have to send civilians to a forced holiday so that we can meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously harm her preparedness."
Eventually, the cuts will touch even the battle forces, announced Pantta.
"But the accounts for financing possible war operations in the overseas will not be directly affected, there will be negative effects on major changes in other budgets," Mr. Pantta warned.
"The contract staff will be cut, which will result in delays in contracting contracts supporting our people's war efforts."
"The situation of paid employees will be reduced, and the delayed payments will be made to suppliers and subsequent distortions of legal and political support."
Both Senators of Panetta wrote down ten days ago and asked him for details about possible impacts on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the obstacle to the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this hard measure," the senators announced in the joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not about the conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"Planed cuts are a threat to the United States' national security, which we should not allow."
"Since we see if the letter of Panetta and the recent warning will increase pressure on Congress approval budget and strengthen the votes calling to leave the Pentagon from the list of cut zones.
Pantta has recently been more open in interviews about possible cuts, even though he himself has gone to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a hard fight.
At the press conference held a minute a week, the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his resort can expect - a shell of army within which, however, will lack the core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like a plane without trained pilots."
"He'll be a paper tiger, like an army of cascades, buildings and bombs without sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," said Pantta at the beginning of the Pentagon speech.
"It will be as a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with the potential enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
In the Annex with the letter of McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically defines how to reduce the "remarkable operating risks: late response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of planting and deployment across the world; expected unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, the pantta added that some of the biggest defence projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 project, planned new bomber, ballistic submarine of the new generation, new coastal battleship and new ground combat vehicle, which the army and marine infants wanted to replace the humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the F35 aircraft, 80 billion USD would be spared over the next 10 years, but its supporters claim that this is the necessary further step in improving the army, which is necessary for the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize A lie
An easy view of recent newspaper titles suggests how serious and all-time lies and deceiving in everyday life are.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands to do with accusation that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim the other lies.
The managers at Penn State were accused of a crooking testimony trying to hide records of the fact that a retired football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught saying to the American President Barrack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie could destroy the entire career and strengthen the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a fool out of himself when he published the information that was immediately disrupted by unquestionable evidence.
John Edwards' former presidential candidate was accused of abuse of finance from his campaign to try to hide his non-human affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that struck around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in his function of his sexual traction with Monica Lewinska.
It's all about cheating in school and university.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students a test response just to look good themselves in their assessments.
Men who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
How many fakes do we meet?
Studies show that on one day you'll lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's assume that many of them are a merciful lie.
Another study showed that in the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, strangers were lying three times.
The determination of lies, or "recognition of lies," is an essential skill that everyone should adopt for personal or working reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharada, when a person screams: "I have you." Disregarding is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been violated.
Liars look in your eyes.
It's not like they're crawling, shaken, blushing or screwed.
However, do not show yourself that it is difficult to notice and reveal a liar.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a branch building, a small face expression, a way of creating questions and timing them.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and developing sector relating to the recognition of lies and it is clear that deception is a modern skills that can be easily learned, and in today's complex world can help you very much - especially if your business obligations include hiring, organising interviews, negotiating or managing people.
The good liars can read well in others, let them sink in alertness, guide their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men carrying more "sebearing" lies, while women say more lies "oriented to others" - mostly to protect their feelings - that women lie less often to their partners than free people (all lies they say, mostly "incredible").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe normal behavior of the subject.
It's called initial observation.
Thanks to him, he will have later findings what to compare with.
Note the holding of the body of the subject, his laughter, his voicework.
You should know if someone's normally constantly knocking his legs so that you unlawfully accuse him of lies just because he's going to start knocking his legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the glances of false verbal and never-bearing behavior.
However, consider it only as warning signals, not as evidence of lies.
People who speak a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their invented story, they can turn the shoe tips to the door, move to the exit, change the body's hold, or show a "relevance after the end of the conversation" - a exaggerated relaxation and a change of position when it's difficult to testify behind them.
People performing interviews often give a false signal that there's an interview over, just to see what relief it's gonna look like after it's ended.
Also feel the language of the entity.
It's famous about how Scott Peterson used himself and used last time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which started a national search for her body.
The deceiving individuals may also express themselves deliberately: "I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Lewinska" or the difficult question would repeat the whole.
The most common verbal signs are only very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "limiting language" when answers to a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... of what I know... from what I know... according to my best consciousness."
In this answer, we will not know too much, and it is often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal any lies, but it is possible to take advantage of the skill that helps the lie to be searched.
Using these skills, a person will have a greater chance that he will not fly a liar and a fraud in his personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of oil pipes will be redirected after the threat of deferring approval by the American Government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus posting unions against each other, but calmed the environmentalists - the company with the construction of the pipeline announced that he was willing to redirect the project so that things could be moved again.
TransCanada announced on Monday night that it would move the planned route of pipes from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the Nebra Government headquarters.
TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even if it leads another route.
This notification came after the Foreign Ministry stated last week that it defers the decision on the federal authorisation of the project, where it does not carry out studies of possible replacement routes, which would help not to hit Sandhills in Nebrasca and to the water layer of Ogallala, the extensive underground water supply.
"This is a really move forward," said the Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would likely postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. a year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play a policy role in the decision.
Obama, in his written statement last week, described his decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support to him.
1,700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Albert's Province to Refinery in Texas, there are 700,000 oil barrels daily.
Six states will need to be cut this way.
This project completely hates the environmentalists, but they love the work jackets, which estimate that 20,000 new jobs appear on the pipeline work.
However, the Lawmakers in Nebrasca opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company to not hit the Sand Hills region and to the water-driven layer of Ogallal, the main sources of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a small negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the Ministry General ordered a new review of the process of the original study and focused mainly on two questions.
Once it was that the lobbyist hired TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, was not a conflict of interest in the programme.
Next, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle's been accused of puppying fears for her.
The New York family claims that Patti LaBelle's singer wreckedly invaded their manhattan house and scared their daughter so that she was sick of it.
The appearance of the hit "Lady Marmalade" frightened the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "the change of personality, sleep disturbance" and "the increased fear of strangers," claims her family in a lawsuit brought to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10, last year, the stage engineer Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a teacher in kindergarten, and Genevieve was on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk set up the car, Roseanna Monková met the baggage down to their house in the Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monková said she stopped by the door for a minute and she put the baby away for a while.
"Somebody appeared behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "Yes," and I left to lift her up."
LaBelle irritatedly humiliated the pregnant woman.
"Aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monková.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking hard, shouting out the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started popping water on me.
They say Genevieve got a hysterical seizure.
"I said to that woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle was on the mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - threw her and had to stop her until her escort, who then dragged her into the waiting car, said Roseanna Monková.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much when she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter in which LaBelle demanded an apology, but no answers were received.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokespersons don't respond to our calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit demands a more precise compensation, but a family attorney, Sam Davis, said that he took the case freely and that the family plans to give all the money spent to the charity organization devoted to the children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month child in his arms."
Climate disadvantage has slowed down the economy
During the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdeza grew in Sinaloa unemployment and insecurity, foreign investments decreased and with them as well as the economy.
This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdeza, called the government of change itself, and this government has brought great expectations on economic progress, but because of the unfavourable climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth was recorded and even a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of agricultural losses, reduced the potential for growth of the state economy, resulted in a reduction in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In agriculture, there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which distorted the dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the report on damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damages were recorded on 582 835 hectares of worked soil, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found partial damage.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the State recorded an increased increase during the first three quarters. From January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa, which represents the unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population, unemployment increased to 5.28% and increased to 5.28% between July and August, average unemployment increased and reached 6.19%, which is about 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, an increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly on the basis of the steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnessing an increasing unemployment related to various factors, among others, the loss of liquidity on the market due to the reduction of resources due to the legislation which the Congress approved in the fight against money laundering. For the illegally authorised dollars, it is not easy to earn them, invest or use them for something," stressed.
Discontinuation of migration
López Cervantes stated that the rise in unemployment is also part of a demographic factor.
"The number of persons who leave abroad to the United States has declined, however, because of the unnecessary entry and then because, even though these people get abroad, it is hard for them to get a job; so people are staying and demanding work from our state, and so unemployment is growing", said.
Insufficiency
The analysis of the work market in Sinaloa is also deteriorated because of the growing insufficiency that dominates in the field of employment. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the residents in the state work without giving benefits to social security management.
Other features of the labour market, such as low salaries, are added to unemployment and inconsistencies. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries of the country, as stated by the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Labour Secretariat and Social Planning Secretariat.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa working in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesets, deeply below the national average, which is 7,375 pesets.
Shortening of direct foreign investments
In addition to the decline in economic activity and unemployment growth, the most significant decline in direct foreign investment in the past 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment amounted to USD 630 697, which represents a decrease of 87.74% compared to the amount of $5 143 312 over the same period in the preceding year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government presents investments of 17,280 million pesets per year.
Debt
In the context of the economic decline scenario, the government of the State requested a State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million peso.
Reactions
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of government, Maria Lópeze Valdése pointed to the lack of government management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 there was no alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really negligible during this year. We must intensely work on getting back the land that we lost this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, there was no harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the proper and synchronised functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better" said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as freezing at the beginning of the year have stopped the state economy and reduced its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including the freezing, and one of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not quickly recover so that it could re-establish the dynamics that would make it possible to achieve acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we found ourselves deep under the expected forecasts", said.
Re-determination of mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employment Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state should be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"We are currently observing that we are working. We believe that a long-term plan in which the objectives and economic directions of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work ahead
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the vision of the future, which would better guide the efforts of the government.
"I would say at the moment that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan", said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress in the governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to be friendly, and I can say that there is a work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Judged for 8 kg marijuana
Resident Navolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of fines for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was sentenced for a criminal offence to threaten health, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army's ingredients on 7 June 2010 on a visit to Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in El Castillo district, Navolato.
Dealer was driving in a pick up-colored van. In the car he had a black bag and a small bag in the seat of the passenger. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secure man remained available to the Court of First Instance of the second department and the management remains internal within the Centre for the implementation of the legal impact of criminal offences.
Contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of the programmes such as Hábitat, Public Rescue and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be brought to the end or that they will be very delayed because of the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The manager of urban social development said that, until now, the construction work has gone forward, the government is now in danger that the government will not be able to provide adequate deliveries that require more than 11 million peso for three programmes.
It has stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. By now, the state is 25%, and only Federation and the city have added funds, and it is therefore possible that there will be delays in the implementation of the projects.
"They are to secure almost 12 million, and even though the year is going to end, we have never had anything. Even though we had to get a part in July," he said. "In order to not waste time, we started projects and continue very marvelously, but we're missing money."
He argued that last year, for the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not fulfil the relevant deliveries and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan so that it could pay more than 7 million that did not give them the State Administration.
"The same thing has happened to us in the past six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get the funds that would cover what he had not completed the state," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise by the State Representatives regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that Armanda Villarreal was sent to the Secretary of Administration and Finance to advance the procedure and the corresponding percentage has arrived as soon as possible.
"They were to give us 12 million, and even though the year is coming to the end, we haven't even got a dog."
The Court of Justice approves the end of the analogue broadcast in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action lodged by Senate and the Chamber of Chamber against the Presidential Decree, which wishes to accelerate the so-called "disclosure of analogue signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He stated that there were no necessary eight votes to disburse it.
Menshina of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he gave a decree in which the individual steps were given to lead to the transition to Earth's digital television.
With this result, the action lodged by the Senate was rejected, because the qualified majority of eight votes were not attained in order to allow the court to comment on the constitution or inconsistence of the decree which remains valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree as unconstitutional because the regulation of all questions relating to radio and television is a matter reserved under the law by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Parliament supported the constitutional dispute in attempting to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein, leading to the transition to digitalisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action lodged by the House without having entered into the discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister declared that it is not identifiable with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that a federal execurity cannot be structured through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority" and reminded that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal exekution that has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the State.
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the world's biggest changes in the last few years. It is associated with better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that delaying the change would mean to delay the benefit of digitalisation, which requires a decision in the matter of public interest. Digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but is also affected by economic, social, political and national security issues.
As he pointed out, these questions "require the operation of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State. It includes a number of competences which the Constitution confers in the hands of the government."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and has done so through its governments, even though they have been available by highly specialised technical authorities.
It stated that it is not possible that the government by issuing an inappropriate decree, which, to a certain extent, interferes with the jurisdiction of the Congress, put into the administration of the laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacan, they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by Voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor’s elections is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 of 6074 votes were not counted.
The possibility of submitting "voice after vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacan, where, in accordance with the figures published by the Programme of Pre-electoral Results (PREP) the difference is between the first and second place in the Governor's elections of less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been calculated by the votes of 879 of the total 6074 voters.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacan (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a number of measures have been approved by the Electoral Authority a few days ago, November 9, to harmonise local standards with the Federal Election Reform.
As yet recalled, Michoacan officially did not confirm his political constitution or his State Election Code or the Law on Electoral Justice. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due in this election period and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had forgotten their publication within the time limit set in the Law of the Official State Journal, and had objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) solved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the voice of the state heads in the case of constitutional reforms for "free and illegal", because it has no right to "or to approve, nor to vet".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the measures by the General Council of IEM, it will be possible for the partial and total concentration to be carried out by the local election authority.
In this way, a partial countdown of votes, one or more election packages will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant field or there is no available by the chairman; or, if there were errors and obvious infringements of election results.
In addition, the total recalculatement of votes in all electoral urns will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the elections and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; every time the express request of the party and/or the coalition suggested by the candidate at the beginning of the session is made.
The total recalculation of the votes will also be possible if, after a proper calculation, it is found that the difference between the probable winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is a express request from the political party whose candidate ended in the second place.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral circles have not yet been counted.
His final will
His ashes will be dispersed in the Zapalinamé mountain, confirmed the family.
The remnants of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown, and during Monday the ceremony will take place.
According to the family, the Colonel's last wish was to disperse his ashes in the Zapalinamé mountain.
After the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortése's family returned to Coahuila's capital on board the aircraft of the Mexican air force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the Colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where the family and friends came.
At 5:30 a.m., a farewell was held at the Technological Institute in Saltillo, which organized his former high-school colleagues and members of the American football team, Felipe Bacio at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ash was distracted in the Zapalinamé mountain. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "He was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined Colegio del Aire air school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it, because they said he was even driving a camper, but he always went after his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a very good man, "sotva came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when Martha Sahagun brought him to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapone to the aid of his uncle, because he is convinced that he died in his favorite life: driving the plane.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, Colonel of Mexican Air Forces, we said goodbye to all the honours that he had come to give to him by Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican air force itself, the leaders and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he studied both in the studio and sport.
Bacio Cortés died last days after the helicopter fell, which he was driving. On board was also the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and the other six persons, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the saltillen native Bacio Cortése (repelled) arrived to be handed over by the burial service by the Mexican air forces under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez, where his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered together.
There were three abandoned dead bodies on Cadereyta NL ship.
A few hours before the finding of the military leaders, 11 persons were detained in this area for criminal offences associated with organised crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into different parts of the body and heads were found on an abandoned ship of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
There was a 1,5 kilometer of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who were moving in these places noticed that the cabin with the beige-caw fence had opened the doors from time to time.
When they looked inside, from about three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately warned the competent authorities.
One of the persons had a sports shirt of yellow colors and dark cotton pants and there was no shoes. There was also a man lying in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further there was the body of another person dressed in red sports shirts and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying face toward the ground.
According to the data at the location, all three persons were probably murdered in another place because the bullets were not found.
There were messages addressed by one group of organized crimes of another and a number of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained.
The secretary of National Defense introduced 11 persons among whom youth are also members of the Cadereyt Crime Group, which was operated mainly in the area of Cadereyt, which is linked to the kidnappings, murders, persecutions and illegal burials.
According to the information published at the first attempt of 11 November in Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detained person managed to be released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6 pm. The military staff was at the rancho Viejo mall in Cadereyta when he noticed cars without the SPZ and in it two people.
After stopping the car, they took a search and discovered one rifle, a bullet and 18 bullets.
Then, on November 13th, around 14th, one of the accomplices in La Frauda was arrested. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burial in the villages of General Teran, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country beyond the outbreak of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country beyond the outbreak of economic disaster and which it has put into danger the whole eurozone.
The presidential palace has issued a report in which Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can create a government.
It is expected that it will be introduced by a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government takes power.
Monti declared that he would present the results of his interviews with the political parties to the government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti clearly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but his tone suggested that obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of government creation in less than three days, which is much shorter than usual, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which is why the amount of debt has climbed to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by the former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a hard package of austerity measures that require European leaders, and it will only be possible to restore the damaged credibility of Italy.
There is a great pressure on Monti to hurry. Because of the instability of markets, interest from the Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity of 7 percent, Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told the journalists after the Monti meeting: "We said that we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last possibility for Italy to get out of this thrilling situation.
Monti's hope of success has been substantially multiplied thanks to support from PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended for good results," said Angelina Alfano, the secrets of the mid-repair party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because until now, a number of its members have been built against the government with the technocratic majority that Monti builds.
Parliament support
The new government of Monti must have strong support for Parliament to promote unpopular savings reforms.
Any obstacles or delays in the efforts concerned could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, which enabled a very rapid procedure in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of the week, when it was clear that the Berlusconi would give the demissi, the interest of Italian bonds returned to critical borders and react to uncertainty whether the new government president would be successful.
To save Italy, whose public debt is 1,8 billion euros, would be beyond the possibility of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti declared that his government should remain in power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecasts that the politicians would only give him time to make reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politics in his cabinet, but large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts in order to lead Italy from the difficulties in which the country has reached due to financial pressure.
Political resources have indicated that two-sided disability and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to integrate government and political personalities.
The Spanish participates more often in international matches than the Costa Ricans
From 22 Spanish football players ten exceeds the border of 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of 22 invited players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica, if we compare 22 players of both countries who have met at a friendly game at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and Europe masters, the number one month's rating of FIFA, have a wide range of class A midterm games on their account, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman's defender, who played 50 international matches as the only one.
This number was reached last Friday in the battle against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
The Spanish footballers who play in the Battle of Stars and in powerful clubs of the first English league are maintaining an intense activity on the League Champions and Domestic Champions and Games at the High Level in Europe as Champions League over a year.
To the previous, we also need to add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated discharge struggles at the European and world championship.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation has a goalkeeper of Íker Casillas, which last Saturday before England (the loss of 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also take place today against Costa Rica and will get a new record for Spain - 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 matches on its account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week with other Spanish players who have 100 matches on their account. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol approached the hundreds with 97 matches.
Following Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Uman move the left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 exceeded the border of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of games.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stand Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba Two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for his first match.
The best shooter of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the cosmetic side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Kvinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of celebration of twenty years of existence
"The journey to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts in the National Stadium next Sunday.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the possibility to play on Costa Rica represents a dream that was fulfilled.
That's what the bassist said and founding member Jeff Ament spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the south-American continent in the tour at the occasion of celebrating 20 years of existence and on Sunday 20. will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will be held at the National Stadium from 19:30, along with the angelic group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a show from an interview you can find the whole transcript on the La Nación website on the internet.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans experience?
The way to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes real.
In South and Central America, we're barely the second time and the experience has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy to bring you our music.
I'm asking, because the group literally loves this, fans experience these days very intensely.
What do you say to your most rocky favourers?
Thank you for spending so many years with us.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it cause more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've been showing in the last 21 years have been in the horizon for a few weeks.
We've done some great show in Sao Paul and we're hoping that we're in the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We're actually looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like surfing, we like the jungle, and for both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers' friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are surfing in Costa Rica or in Nikaragua or Mexico. These are the best surf spots, so we've learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a great show with many songs.
What did you plan on your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we never played here, we have no limitations we can't do.
We will try to perform the best show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from every album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we're focusing on them, and we're also surprises, because we'll remember why we liked it so much and maybe we've forgotten it.
So it's more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's even more interesting for people.
You've celebrated this tour for 20 years of art.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I think that none of us could imagine going to be in one big rock band and staying in it for over 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we've been given and we're concerned that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to have a look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't get better.
What meant to you that you were an important part of the creation of the genre of grunge?
It was always an honor for us to be part of this group in which they are represented by themselves.
Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group will be created in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups from one city to another.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We're lucky that they're all our friends and we're honored to be part of this movement that came in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and have the same members after all these years.
Yes, we four have joined us for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're lucky that we're still in this world, and secondly, our role plays the fact that we're constantly interested in each other.
We're all close friends and we've managed to open a musical path that leaves everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the other, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to go too much on tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you'll remind yourself that you have to have music and what you gave her to respect.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first, it was something magnificent.
We existed three years as a band, and we never released a album after Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who began in the band with us. When I listen to some song or I look at pictures, I remember Andy how incredible I was with him. It was always the joy of working with him, laughing, talking about music or football and many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss him so much.
The National band Las Robertas will be entrusted to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as prescotts?
Yes, production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most, so we're wondering what Las Robertas will offer lively and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter lively?
That's the question for Eda (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing he attacks.
Who affects you as a bassite?
A lot of people.
I was the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about bassites I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though it's not in fashion anymore?
I think we've always felt a lightly separated from grunge's words.
When grunge is said, I'm going to imagine groups that I've mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that have been born at the same time. And if it's so important today, it's something great, because it's a music that's worth listening to, and the Mudhoney groups play better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a lightly cloudy character and now it's more positive.
What's behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that in the new album there are some pieces that are lighter torment, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
In both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and it's a deeply dark song.
I think if you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from a family or a friend, these things start affecting your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make a cloudy music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been reinpatient for medical tests
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the public hospital, where he would be tested for the muscle loss suffered in the area of the lower limbs, he informed his nurse.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving the 25-year sentence of freedom for the violation of human rights committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers several diseases, including the cancer of the tongue, for which he has been operated four times and already have doctors under control.
A messenger of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the Canal N television station that Fujimori will undergo tests in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses power in lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori might have received mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not wish for mercy because he feels innocent.
It was four times operated because of the cancer of the tongue, dropped 18 kilograms and added other shortcomings as a severe erotic gastritis, cyst on saliva, kidney stones, high pressure and circular problems in the legs, listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been punishing since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 people who killed the murderous army essays operating illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political topics of the region.
Mujica will meet in the midst with its Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón. It is the most important meeting of extensive visits full meeting with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguaya community living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," published the Uruguay Presidential office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to force Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy has placed a South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkoza threatened that countries that would continue to remain on the position of tax havens will be excluded from the international community. This declaration has caused an rejected opinion by Uruguay and consulting the Ambassador in this European country.
Mexiko chaired G20 since November. G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, the Latin American country has concluded an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has in recent years been striving to specify agreements on fiscal exchange in order to get out of the "black leave" Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries which have not introduced all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has resulted in strengthening the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been struggling for over 25 years to save Princess of Peach from the bonds of an evil Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to all shops around the world, has been created since the beginning so that you use all the characteristics that offer the transferable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without using glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how stereoscope should work without glasses", said the paper worker specialized in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "The first video game Nintendo created specifically for this carrier" because until now successful images as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
Speaker Nintendo said that, besides that the image is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simply" whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go into the second round at the levels of the game that are more difficult this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome the various challenges and "do not lie under optical deceptions".
This new Super Maria approach in 3D also assumes that the figure returns to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the notes of those who are watching and repeating a successful formula from the previous parts. It is that the bearded man installer will have to pass through the dangerously mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, there will be also "playing" Luigi.
Colom approved the release of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had stepped up on the issue of former President Alfons Portilla, who is to respond to a conspiracy in the United States for the purpose of laundering $70 million of US dollars.
This ends with the aim of Guatemala to respond at the request of the northern country that calls for Portilla to be judged.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He ensured that, during his mandate, he had "not intervened" in court decisions and allowed all the editions he had reached on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and severe harm to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloma's step means a step of excruciation after all judicial and constitutional trials have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled in the years 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation is resolved in Guatemala and will be guaranteed respect for human rights.
Portillo was found innocent in the disbelief of 120 million at the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed and returned the case to the game.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a state of danger
The organisation was created to help children without education to avoid feeling at the edge of society.
The Bilance of the first 25 years of existence of the organisation of social support of Trinijove is very important: 6,000 young people who threatened the social exclusion have been assisted, and the organization has been helping them over 25 years to overcome difficult situations.
To this end, a long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group need to be added.
Last anniversary was also used to present a balance in the ceremony act which took place in the former manufacturing premises of Fabra and Coats and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Triniuave was established in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, unemployed, drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions, who worked with the association in the past 25 years, attended yesterday in Sant Andreo.
The vast political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work that Trinijove is carrying out.
Together with President Generalitat, Arture Maso, and his predecessor Jordi Pujolem took part in the ceremony of the former socialist education counselor, Ernest Maragall, and former mayor deputy and current ecological-social councilman Ricard Goma.
The great Fabra and Coats Hall also joined the present consultant for social welfare and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Triniuave was created in a very difficult time and that today is also a whole range of obstacles, but he added that the work the association brought to today is a good basis.
The President pointed out Triniuave as an example of how to fight against unfavourable circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work he does, nothing new," he said.
There's been an eviction of a taken-up house in which gigantic parties were organized.
Intruders took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon, without opposition
It all suggests that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51th Street of Balmes have experienced is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left a building that was illegally residing and where they organized giant parties that were building the neighbors, leaving the building from the court order without having to intervene the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent recurrence of the situation.
"From this moment, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The occupants who took 11 out of the 13 apartments in the building - the remaining are inhabited - they took all the electrical and partly water facilities, including painted the walls and left the garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up other tenants.
Beside the building is disco, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press, that for the time the building was occupied, sales decreased by 80%.
The disco owner emphasizes that the occupants of the building made her unfair competitors because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while on discos costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the laws of the neighbors due to noise. But the problems did not cause visitors to discotheques, but the residents of the house taken and, in particular, those who participated in the events organised here, whose frequency and intensity increased in recent weeks, according to the angry people of the surroundings.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed to the owner of the building and for nine months she had forgiven her rent.
The city police also confirmed that more complaints were received from the neighbours in the last few weeks.
The chairman of the PP People's Group at the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building was immediately evicted and thus ended with the problems of civil society suffered by neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The chairman explained that only one staircase had been prevented before summer, but in recent months the occupants had reached all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and in one of them even happened to theft.
In this respect, he added that "the need to end with impunity and be consistent with the effects of the civil liability that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared out the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours, the police got into the 35th building on Mont-ral Street after the neighbors called her, who saw four people enter the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects gathered at the opportunity to file a procedure that brings more than a field of fees
The city selection procedure at 16 gates again opens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) has already destroyed during the largest bloom, this administration has printed several pamflets to support the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park in Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top borders of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolitan is one of the few which do not focus on the axis north - south, but up (hore) - down (shore).
Qualification of Collseroly as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with the wilderness instead of the bear Yogi.
This was the position until September, when the town hall declared a mega competition formed by 16 auditions on the same number of entrance gates to Collseroly.
The gate, of course, records the ideas of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, from a purely organisational point of view and on the basis of the city’s reflex, this issue becomes a central theme of all Barcelona’s architects.
It is already the same topic as when two members of this old caste chosen when meeting in the elevator will give their hand.
And this is what one of the rare matches between what three Barcelonan architects think and prestigious university professionals think.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Mart Bayon: the selection procedure has its grounds.
According to Roldan, after the question of the side of the bay, "we need to" discuss the "hore side" so the Ildefonse Cerda on green apples was not drawn to the end.
"We must be based on the principle that the brightest Barcelonan park is the beach.
Among other things, great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for which the name "gate to Collserola" bears a "lexic trap": we must not imagine them "like entrances to the park, but rather as defining the zone where it can be operated".
Modol, as well as Roldan and Bayon with the experience of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" which presents "some danger".
The dangers arising from the "insecure that today represents a public place project" after the experience of the '80s that had in the Forum's "singing of your swans".
The first concern is the definition of the borders where it should be built.
"Something to define means to take another step", that's basically moving a step further.
"The need to be remembered by new urban and planning instruments, because the current (with reference to the General metropolitan plan (PGM) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more specifically on the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be "wait as a park" but not a Barcelona part, for purely topography reasons.
Modol also reminded that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "not to end up in the trash", even though he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his gremium that it will reach the project from "first moment".
In addition, it understands that the proximity to the mountain and the city is a passage that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "who doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("this is all about skills", it adds), which needs to be created: "Architekti should be only tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complicated, because there is no global vision of Collserola: "It has been declared 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole".
This causes at least he has signed up for all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can attack the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should be secured throughout the entire area of equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and greenery.
Casino has pardoned Jonási Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal attorney Cadino Red granted mercy to the brother of Mayor Monterrey in the process in which he was chased for alleged blackmailing.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal attorney Casino Red gave him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in that precinct that discussed the blackmail case in which the brother of Mayor Monterrey was accused.
After an assassination on Casino Royale owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás had asked him to pay the economic quota to allow the town hall in Monterrey to allow illegal operation in the bet house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecution started criminal prosecution of the brother of the panist mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent 3 for property offences, he was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the State.
On this point, he remained in the next 49 days after the second detention regulation was carried out and a public ministry agent revoked the possibility of a joint participation or organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyt for suspecting the extortion of Casina Red owners by a total of one and a half million dogs. However, he remained only a few hours in a prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city area in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, Jorge Yanez, who declared that after almost two months of the investigation, enough evidence was collected to prove Jonas' guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of the amount of 1.5 million dogs to the casino in exchange for the promise that the operation will be allowed.
This Monday, the legal Agent Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, joined Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for grace for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal negotiations, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias asked García Gómeza whether damage was corrected and who of the partners decided to grant mercy.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal grace of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process that was led against him, no complaint will be possible. It is also impossible to ask for damage or punishment.
After reconsidering with the legal attorney around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanéz, came to prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to announce to Jonas that his official grace was granted and his case was postponed to the archive.
He also informed him that the judge has issued an immediate order for his release.
The secretary of Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented the details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Governor, Francisco Blake, and seven other persons died.
The Secretariat for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of an accident in which the Secretary of the Principal Francisco Blake Mora died and the other seven people show that the helicopter fell directly on the ground with full force without having the pilot to try to land.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, the pilot stated that the climate conditions allow for flights prior to the launch of the aircraft.
"The numbers that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings have entered the tree branches of 25 meters from the place where the unit has lost the hull."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, therefore fulfilling all personnel transport requirements.
In addition, he claimed that no components were found on the ground on the basis of the investigation carried out in the impact area.
"In the search it was found that parts of the plane are not located in another place, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, fulfilling all the demands for passenger transport.
The terrain is showing the slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is the most important to obtain the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the Director-General of the airport and the auxiliary services declared that helicopter of the President's General Staff was moving at the rate of trip and there was an accident on a soft upward terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the accident", said.
At the press conference, representative of SCT Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the air standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at the start, in accordance with this aircraft proceeding towards the border, between DF and State Mexico were visible layers clouded at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the cloudy crew, she was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last entry of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that prior to impact, there was no loss of control or disturbance of the flight trajectory.
Disperse of the residues of the aircraft within the restricted territory:
The information currently available allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and on the side.
The range of the residues of the aircraft suggests that helicopter was complete at the time of impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence of accident at the site that indicates there was an explosion or a fire.
The final results of the investigation show that there could be some contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the residues of the aircraft were found up to 900 feet above the sea, the terrain is considered, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show the footage where the route is likely to fall apart.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have reached contact with the country in several places.
After a careful search in the area of an accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the territory of the destination, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact occurred in a condition where the helicopter was still complete.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance launched a genus research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that he is conducting research in order to reveal a gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetics of Obesity in children and adolescents" will enable results of overweight.
In the report Head of the Research Medical Units in the field of Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Progressive Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
It can also be involved in research by a wide public, having or not authorised. People can come to IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where each team has been conducted for eight hours by juvenile testing.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sport Centre (Mexican State) and since 8 October this activity was also carried out in the Sports Center of Unhualcóyolt (Eastern of the Mexican State).
As soon as the data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (i.e. from the Federal distrikt) and eventually at the Morelos Sports Centre (very from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the ingredients and the importance of genetics as regards the development of obesity and to track Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years, with consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He underlined that every Saturday all participants are performed anthropometry measurements (weight, height, circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and genes are tested (to identify genes that are involved in children's obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals over an alarming increase in child weight.
'Healthy surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in only six years, only boys had an increase in obesity by 77% and 47% in girls. A dramatic increase also occurred in the case of overweight,' said the IMSS expert.
He pointed out that one of the reasons for finding indicators is the idea that the population of the country differs from other populations of its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% of European and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes responsible for the formation of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calory) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will receive the overall assessment of the state of children, thus finding out whether they have known overweight or obesity.
He showed that even the presence of the wrinkles of dark color (acantosis) on the neck and pre-locating suggests the likelihood of the individual to suffer metabolic problems and precursorbosis.
The information is yet confidential, the doctors are giving it to their parents in writing and explaining to them all the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that they have to do to avoid their children’s diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a seated way of life, meaning a lack of daily physical activity, a full-day resettlement before television and use of means of transport instead of walking to short distances.
The overweight also causes a large caloric income, this is more consumption of salted beverages, hydrohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein and genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
The UNAM Asfalt won't be a rival
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemicals, creates modified asphalts with polymers, thus creating a mixture of better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperatures
If it had been properly cared for lensing, it would not be necessary to correct almost 200,000 pollutants after each period of rain in the Metropolitan Region of Valle de México, to point out Rafael Herrera Hierar, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemicals (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt lens were adequate, there would have been a significant limitation of excretion, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture Technological cause of mutilation, which he pronounced during the International Year of Chemicals, he announced that the laboratory under his guidance develops modified asphalts with polymers, thereby creating a mixture of similar characteristics asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both low and high temperatures.
Herrera The hierarchy believes that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places with extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the grouping of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular mass, which are called asphalts, and others with a low molecular mass called malts. Together, they supply asphalt the typical viskoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves like fluid, at 120 degrees has high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost in solid state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not unified, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, he alerted the chemical engineering expert.
The scientist from the Faculty of Chemicals observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered by a flexible tile consisting of six layers of materials, of which three last are mixed with asphalt.
Among the supreme layers is the asphalt insert, formed by small stones lit in asphalt and then pressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a insert is an asphalt.
During the passage of cars or when the pressure is created, it is possible that the forces in the tile are well distributed.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would have been even better, he believes a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer called a coat, formed by fine stones, is placed on the asphalt insert, i.e. by sand also lit in asphalt.
Given that this layer will come into contact with the cars, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must ensure the machining of the vehicle.
As a part of the lensing will be exposed to a large burden, the coat must have a sufficient thickness and must be guarded by the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, the water has a great effect on the function of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it's hard to get out, it makes all layers soften and the formation of moistures.
He explained that during the production of extrusions, the first ponition film of the cloak is damaged by the asphalt insert, but there is no damage at one moment, but it is a gentle process that should stop at the first stamps using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National Research System, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the production of sparklings, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the vehicle burden and must guarantee that this burden will not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as as as the asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do, and research is at the beginning. For example, the asphalt emulsions that are already available in other countries are worthwhile available on the market and allowing us to correct the extrusions without having to use high temperatures.
What lacked from the Valle candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna didn't get Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle thus acquires the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca has never reached Miss Columbia's crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be pleased with the fact that she was on the winner's platform, she gained a silver crown and shrimp, based on which she became the new first multimise of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was won, the title of the first multimiss. Melina joined the representatives of the women from Valle del Cauca, which had reached the victorious crown, but eventually were announced by the first multimiss. Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domingueez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Romero (1993), Giselle Gars Alzérenas (2000), Giela de Ginarenado, Stephanie Garjus.
The question many ask.
The result is the defeat of great favorits, which in all previous rounds showed that she had to become a new Miss Colombia, and not become the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles, for example, have reached Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which subsequently took the title of Miss Columbia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only The First Multimiss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "What book did you like most and why?", which Martín Murillo Gómez wrote from Leamos literature.
The candidate answered:
"Reading a lot, I believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture, a book that most affected me in childhood was a "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature we all should know, and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
However, this answer did not like the term "culturalize" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
After the end of the celebration, Melina said that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what should happen, it will happen.
And you people, read, if you can, a little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogot journalist suggested that since the beginning the candidate was the most popular, the most famous and the one who took all the previous prizes (Gastronomic Call Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen of Mother), raised the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned up on the scene.
It was apparent during the first presentation of the Hilton beach swimsuit and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was on both lights, she was aware that she lacked strength and light that demonstrated representatives from Magdaleno and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "As home" program at Canal RCN believes that Melinda has won the title of the first multimise confirms the fact that a candidate who will receive the most titles during the competition does not finally leave with the queen's crown."
In addition, Valle had a rather miserable attitude to the media in recent days, and that didn't pay him off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle couldn't convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is the foundation of the National Beauty Competition.
Only at the edge, two days before the election of the international member of the jury Lucy Doughy said that she was looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the competition of Miss Colombia beauty is not enough in itself, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates be involved in such projects before they enter the competition," explains.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was apparent on the back, but it is completely contrary to the jury's verdict that chose Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina had no best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on the ass, which, in my opinion, was not very significant, took points to the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine believes that a native from Valle made a mistake when she made a few surgeons.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't succeed in Valle.
The body was never her strong side and here he chose his tax."
Because of this appreciation, which was the first to grant the National Beauty Assembly, there was a cruel prediction in the swimsuits that had been fulfilled. It was claimed that this was a satisfaction that Raymundo Melina would not have given her the highest crown.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina started today with a year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it will be written into history as one of the queens, who, despite the striking success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of Cali's resident who identified Alfons Can's dead body.
The expert on Cali's fingerprints came into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week was the rank of Eliazar González, the men of Puert Tejada, who worked for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after he graduated with the relevant courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with skin cutting studies, i.e. hand and legs.
The week when the operation against Alfonsi Can was performed, Eliazar told him to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he'd have to identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerill in the world, so they asked him to take the card with fingerprints of Guillerma León Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team to a place where a corpse was found, he did not recognize him for physical appearance, he looked completely different from the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Together with the galton lupus, ink and the transplanter and the Eliazar light started comparing the dactyl records of the body with card records.
The eye didn't disappoint her, it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was entrusted to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirming that it was actually the Supreme Commander Farc.
Track Search
For a dactyloscopy from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that Eliazar González presented to President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of operational services against "Can" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of mistake, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, these people assist in researching crimes such as theft or murder and confirming the identity of caught persons.
When they're caught, a lot of delinquents present fake documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewels and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to download prints, but in this case we could get a print of the entire hand and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts", he recalled.
fingerprints can also confirm or reverse suspicion in the event of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the print on the bottle was actually confirmed.
Even though it's hard to confirm that he was a real killer, it's obvious he appeared on a crime scene.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the prints of the subjects are "continued by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When they appear, they use a transplanter or a tape to collect them.
Then prints are sent to Asiaf, which is a database of offenders, or to the Registrar.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are nowhere entered," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that shines, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there's no traces left.
However, if it may be used, a corresponding comparison must be made.
They protest in New York.
Hundreds of demonstrators were struggling at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stand.
A large part of them were waiting for the order to clear the space and moved to the nearby park.
The members of the Wall Street Movement were provoked on Tuesday by the New York leader when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning, and then they tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of demonstrators were in trouble at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to through a court order that allowed the "resolute" to return to the place. The second part of the movement reacted to clearing by taking the park in the north of the city where there was another detention.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will sit in another place and continue in a lawful battle to return to Zuccotti, both through the assembly and peaceful manifestations," said one of the spokesmen's movements "Let's plant Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the answer of the "resurrected" to the eviction of the camp ordered by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the trial where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order to prohibit violent eviction of the place and allow the demonstrators to continue standing here.
In addition, "distorted" also took another park located on the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish land in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take the place, but then the police came and arrested some of the manifestants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw that some journalists had put in handcuffs.
The organization also ensures that several hundred people were settled on the site, as well as the delegation of religious representatives came to express their support and tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed, is expected to be a court proceedings to be held on Tuesday and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators were even renounced and handed out copies of the court order, and even gave them to those guarding the square, which caused "some little conflicts", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police manifestators were beating.
The court order prohibits the authorities to evict members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or to use "the laws which have been published after the selection began, or prohibit the manifestants access to the park with shops or other places that have previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, given this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of public space and the manifestators, that local laws do not allow them to return to tents and sleepers.
The City Supreme Representative personally defended the early eviction of the Zuccotti Square, the operation in which it was detained to 200 persons and to which it was established because the manifestators "destructed the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it became "the place that people didn't go to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to hurt others", because "some shops have been threatening letters" and "study feared the quality of their lives".
"The morning clearing was terrible and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people", he added a spokesman's movement accused the mayor that "you don't weigh freedom of expression".
The representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said that they were planning to organize "great action" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to remind the two months after which the protests lasted.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians will appear in the TV show "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", a wife of the year musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and a model will be the Virgin Mary in a special show of Canadian TV.
Today, the CTV private television station announced that Anderson and the sentimental song singer Michael Bublé and other major Canadians appear in the TV show "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will be embodied by Virgin Mary.
CTV has shown today the footage of the television program, in which Anderson, also known for Internet domestic pornography, appears with her ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Maria holding a doll in the jewels representing Jesus.
As Josef appeared on the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters appear in the special Christmas broadcast CTV, the Canadian Bublé singer, who was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with a Argentine model Luisanou Lopilato, which is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian on one of her concerts in New York "liška".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and ends in the fall period beginning in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from the destruction of the earthquake that has grown in the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face from World War 2.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have calculated material losses to $300,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of falls, the GDP value between July and September was given to such a position that it was possible to turn the page with the definitive effect: GDP increased by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year begins in March 2012 - also predicts the highest rate of growth compared to January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the renewal of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending decreased by 0.9% compared to the period January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse to use the crisis to build up or restore infrastructures. This is to use the shortcomings to start completely from zero.
Japan is awake, in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in vehicle expenses, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
The flows have been placed in the hands of the internal market, when yen - Japanese currency - has become one of the "saving values" for investors running from the euro area debt crisis and against the alarming forecasts of the US. It is a privilege, but also a great burden on export undertakings.
With stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July until September the yene course.
While markets continue to circumvent the border countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is prudent.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase of yen", said yesterday the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has clarified that the majority of Member States have shown clear economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, foreseeing inertia in the world economy, showed that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
She dropped by four tens to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even got below the average, which is located at 100 level. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens spread insecurity again
Papadimos says that austerity measures will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty that has been reigned, Greece is increasingly inclined to the labyrinth that leads to the emergence of a large debt crisis in Europe.
The fact that the "convenience" of the new transitional Greek government is given more of the requirements of Brussels than the true belief of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would not in any case support and repeated its request to send new elections to the expected date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the Summit of 26 October", said yesterday, Papadimos, during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate by voting on the government's confidence tomorrow.
Package 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message Samarase does not explain any doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have no longer committed ourselves to anything else."
The President of Conservatives went a little far in his speech at the EU and the IMF address. These organisations are to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently need, but also declared that they would not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
Lastly, the European Commission, already explored by the impact that caused Papandre's referendum plays, pointed out that its requirements are inexpensible: it will not unlock any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign "the written commitment without a double and as soon as possible".
The speaker for economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from Trinity will return to Athens very soon and will deal with the new government on "what needs to pay the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek lamb has a little bit more to mess with.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen lifts the privileged position of Spain in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has "attained a significant global position as regards micro-finance".
The Queen of Sofia reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet as regards this instrument of cooperation, which is the essence of "this is the instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for mankind. It is a tool based on trust in humanity".
The Queen, yesterday, launched the 5th global micro loan summit in Valladolid, conviction that "no doubt" about this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Objectives set by the United Nations by 2015. "It is, in particular, to meet the goals to achieve a reduction of half the people who live with less than one dollar per day, i.e. the amount that sets the poverty threshold".
Spain's "will continue to work" and extend the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsible", emphasised the Queen Sofia, which hopes that the initiative and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, will ensure the creation of better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are primarily intended for such loans.
"We have reached many" and "the many challenges are still ahead of us."
The micro loan summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support "basic targets".
Her Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that 100 million families become above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro loans to Spain and extended to other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus" said the queen and added that it was "the act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this instrument as a "surprising idealist, who went on the path to combat poverty." She met her work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet her loan policy on the spot.
Following this experience, the first global summit in Washington and the next meeting, such as the Ivory Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I could conclude constant developments, the Queen explained that the title "head of the family" was granted to her in Valladolida yesterday, "the movement of the poor."
The Queen of Sofia finished her speech by calling on participants to participate in the discussion and search for solutions and allowing them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, has declared that solidarity is an ethical imperative, which must follow all democratic states.
In that sense, she said that it would be a mistake to combine cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balo-hobyte, because this cooperation is "permanent obligations".
Jiménez believes that micro loans represent a "serious and fair policy to eliminate poverty" and now more than ever, governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and do not allow solidarity to become victims of cuts.
For Spain, the micro loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The state secrets for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people who all the others close the door. Mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city that "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity that is contagious."
The CDU proposes the vote of the European President on the basis of general election law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not originally in the programme, but it became only in autumn, especially in order to be satisfied by the members of the parties who view government policy today against the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow against the Italians as lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission was almost unanimous.
Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were opposed and 10 delegates abstained.
Several ovaries stand at the end of Angela Merkel's performance and then several hours later Wolfgang Schäubel, a very pro-European Minister of Finance, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because " nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor in Europe, the time of change has come.
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of President of the European Commission on the basis of general election law "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is out.
Similarly, the delegates rejected the large majority of the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's headquarters depending on the weight of its economy, which clearly will result in a strengthening of Germany's weight.
The Vedena is concerned to calm down the climate within its side, the Chancellor made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohla. However, she did not try to get the congress to talk about the "small" European states or the states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal relating to Europe focuses on one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not feel France.
Only indirectly.
When she reminded me that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon army.
What is fraud in insecurity at work?
Following support, the UMP Party and the Government of offensive against labour insolvency shall launch.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15th, and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on a recurring topic from 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an escort to this offensive, based on the willingness to make savings in the context of increased strictness, but it is not less clear from the perspective of the right-hand presidential campaign, the right-wing majority want to focus on work insolvency.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to force private sector staff on the fourth day of incapacity before they start taking the disease support.
Clearly, without the company's consent, an employee who is ill would have lost four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk causing many bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
Also, measures that would be accompanied by other symbolic measures: to give employees one day unreserved incapacity of work (for example, they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are subject to discussion, the right-wing majority also launches the subject of fraud focused on insecurities linked to labour insufficiency.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, in addition, if you are caught, you will return", he warned Xavier Bertrand in the interview provided by the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem rather unsuitable in view of the truth of iniquity in labour insufficiency.
These were actually the subject of permanent monitoring since 2002 and the political steep that brought their fruit.
French are no more sick than in Europe.
Let's stop at some official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - State Health Insurance), more than EUR 237 million of daily refunds were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute of Research and Health dossier, in 2008, daily refunds were EUR 11,3 billion 5% in health expenditure.
From this amount, 46% involved parent contributions and accidents and 54% were incapacity of work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of the health costs.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14,5 days incapacity compared to 17,8 days in 2009.
The average which covers certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com's work opportunities showed that 75% of the 40,000 French staff in question replied that it did not choose any working day insolvency.
Other studies, this time carried out by hospital insurance institutions, specify that in 2010 37.8% of labour insolvency was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, the French employees are no more than incapacity to work elsewhere.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (for or not for health reasons) was estimated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in insufficiency represents only a very small part compared to black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only a small scale.
Strengthening the legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic insufficiency checks for more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM noted that in 1.5 million controls, 13,8% of 285,000 carried out due to the short-term inability of "unlawed or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorised" were calculated to 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169,000 unauthorised cases for several million employees who had incapacity to work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing a black job.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent EUR 9 to EUR 15 billion missing in the year’s tax collection, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds, and therefore more infinitely than fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to renew its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos delivered these words before Parliament and added that hundreds of days of unity to his government will not be sufficient to fulfil this task.
"In order to rebuild our economy, we need support for our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," said the government's boss when he was carrying out his first public speech on Wednesday at the start of the debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of decisions adopted on 27 October at the euro area summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in the game, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the public deficit of the country would be, from now on, "round 9%" of the gross domestic product after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
The right leader Antonis Samaras expressed its support on Monday by an already approved measure to try to escape the debt crisis, but he pointed out that his party did not commit any additional cost-effective measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," stressed Samras at the meeting with Members on behalf of the New Democracy.
We agreed on the goals of reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economy and Monetary, who warned that the IMF and the EU did not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties supporting the measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanazia and assisted suicide, says the expert committee
According to the King's report, the Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of paliative care, the Commission urgently requires the governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together in order to ensure best paliative care, including in cancer cases.
The Canadian company lives in the mind of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility to speak to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which participated in six experts working in various areas that were ethics, law and medicine.
This Commission recommends to the government to change the criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if such a choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to take such decisions.
At the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by an independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada has placed herself in the 10th place, the study notes that "the medication of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medication, yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to paliative care, tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to all Canada, while in Quebec province this is the highest number with 86% of people died in the hospital.
As regards the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors of the reports come to conclusions against the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is no change in criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicides.
According to experts who have also undergone checks on all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered to be a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides to persons inappropriate or disapproving.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than many cases of these overheses yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is performed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are overlooked by euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that, according to the investigation carried out by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow people to make their suffering easier at the end of life.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the life of the old or hendiced people is less worthwhile.
As regards persons practicing an assisted suicide, 41% of the persons in question judge that they should not be prosecuted in court.
In the matter of maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, says the authors of the report.
In the list of their recommendations, they also propose that the withdrawal of treatment for which there is legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requires professionals to be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the matter of paliative care, the Commission urgently requires the governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together in order to ensure best paliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the matter of paliative or final comfort already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, be euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Restrictions of other experts
Some experts on medical law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report by the Royal Canadian Society experts.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a medical law specialist, has qualified the position of expert signatories of the report as "extreme" among others because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to sick at the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who's been tired of life and who's more than 18 years old could ask him to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who was studying the résume news yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also underlines that this looks like the authors of the reports build the autonomy of persons above all the other values that form the social predecessor of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning marks and restrictions."
Margaret Somerville's medical law specialist also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she was qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the dates of reports regarding the absence of doubts in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the United States of Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus is talking about "complot."
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Al-Assad's supporters manifested yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures have increased on the Syria of President Bashar al-Assad, who resists them with the support of Russia and talks about the "complot" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries with Syria, took up an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
The Jordanian king Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab State, who called President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed," he forwarded power."
"If Bashar had the interests of his country in the heart, he would have to demise, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," King Jordan, the neighbouring country with Syria, said in an interview for the BBC station.
On his side, the head of Turkish diplomacy Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime, which had been undertaken since the beginning of the year, was not a success.
"Those in the Middle East, who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, will leave," said with a hit on the neighboring Syria, which Turkey is applying the increasingly harder line to.
The United States rejoiced with the "intensification of consensus against Assad and unfair negotiations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and of the European Union.
"International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey apply increasingly harder to the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced, during this time, there was a death in Deraa in the south of Syria of 16 civilians and 19 members of direct forces.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed during the shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy guns in Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, during the press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was "out of the crisis."
He also responded lively to the decisions of the League of Arab States to suspend the membership of the Damascus, which according to him constitutes a "unsafe step".
Syria's not going to go down," he assured that "compliments sprained against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to suspend Syria of membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering the "mechanism of the protection of civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Alain Juppé is also favourably encouraged by the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League is called to the Rabat tomorrow to take an opinion on the crisis-solving plan, which was decided on 2 December, and in which the military was expected to be removed from the cities of dissolution and the release of prison manifesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the decision of the League of Arab States yesterday to be "breastful" while China encouraged Syria to take the plan to resolve the crisis, but completely avoided the support of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices after Italians
The next leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a bit of time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include the "bearth" in order to regain credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed the political parties yesterday before meeting the representatives of experts and employers today.
It should build a relatively lean cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in interviews, after meeting the appointed ministerial president.
President Gianfranco Fini expects Parliament to ask for confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end by presenting a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nerve in the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy pays precise terms" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understandable".
His appointment was favourably accepted by markets from the beginning, but the concern was reappeared after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team involving the technocrats in particular, although stressed that he would like to adopt "politicians" in it.
He expressed the belief that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. by the date of the next elections.
According to the President of Gianfranc Fini's Chamber, the new government will get Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and to make Italy a strong article again" of Europe.
The speaker of European Commissioner Olli Rehn underlined that "with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that despite the cost-effective plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not reach its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria business union Emma Marcegagliová, which meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy" or the country which does not show growth cannot follow the deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognised for its expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing the introductory authors' call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid premature elections, as Italy has to place government bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iranian nuclear programme
The Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran to develop the detonator used for the atomic weapon, announced on Tuesday the American NGO specialized in atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents escaped from this UN Agency.
Last week, MAAE told her "real concern" as regards the "possibly military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the ISIS institute, which is widely extracted from the IAE documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet military research centre in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where he was supposed to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the centre to set up a business producing "nano-diamanty" in Kyev.
The economic difficulties of his companies were to bring him to contact Irish Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was then to cooperate in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last IAE report, the clear information that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew the method well, but which, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of his work career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of the country from which it came."
Protimuslim crimes and delicacies increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal offences and deliberations targeted against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other race and religious violence decreased slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase compared to the procedure of 13% in the case of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% in the offences against Jews and a total increase of 14% in anti- religious crimes and deliberations.
The total number of "nevisable crimes" increased very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% according to the FBI was motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the fall in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and delicacies rise again", stressed the Human Rights Organisation First dealing with human rights," the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," added the organization in its communicators.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims as well as all forms of hate crimes must be considered to be a serious violation of human rights", adds one of Paul Legendre's leaders.
"American government can and has to do more to deal with these evils", it adds and estimates that this could be done by improving the police reports of "nevisable crimes".
In American federal law, an innocent criminal act is the inheritance of the civil rights struggle.
This rule was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, color of skin, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and similar to more Facebook
The website providing microblogation services Twitter introduced changes in design on Monday to enable its users to observe the activities of followers, which resembles its Facebook services.
New offers"activity" and"name" enable you to know better and directly the activities of other people who follow you or people whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know whether it allows to monitor the contributions to be applied to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested"in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, said the AFP spokesperson of Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for his little instinctive functioning, with somewhat inconsistent terms (RT for redistribution of someone else's contribution, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable and celli des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users at once in their "tweets" consider differently the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes many places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Funkce Activities will help me watch some of my Twitter elements," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the Golden Rules on Balanced Budget into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include the "good rule" of budgetary policy in the Constitution with a view to reducing the public deficit and thus avoiding any reduction in the Austrian rating agencies (AAA).
He was himself a social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who reported this decision at the end of the ministerial advice in a situation where Austrian public debt is with its 74.6% high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% established by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay by three billion euros each year," said the multicancler and the Foreign Minister, the Christian Democrat Michael Spndelegger.
Austria therefore concludes at the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly asked that the public deficit be reduced by the end of 2012 and the balance of public accounts be entered in the constitution or the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the German model, Germany was the first European country that adopted such a "right".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal State will not be allowed to exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the Federal countries and the municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to get public debt under criterion 60% of the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong Only
Noda is at risk of a new exchange market intervention
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to strike again on foreign markets if he had to continue strengthening.
"We're going to hit, like we did last time, if we find too much instability" in the only exchange course, explained the Y. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, he just reiterated to the historical values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently exceeded the dollar record valid since 1945.
But only since then, it has been regularly supported by buying investors who consider it a "safe port" in uncertain world economic slowdown times and a European debt crisis.
The dollar was again under 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen to the closest level that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, around 120 yens and more than 160 yen euros were worth a dollar.
This thundering of Japanese currencies damages island exports because it jerks the price of Made in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained by Japanese foreign companies when they transfer them to domestic currency.
"Japan recovers" from the ruins caused by the March earthquake and the wave of tsunami, which destroyed the region of Tohoku in the northeast of the country, emphasized Y. Noda, who feared that this healing would not only kill in a fragile recovery egg.
The third economic power of the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) for the first time in one year by exploring the growth of exports and consumption of households in difficulty.
But the Prime Minister considered that the high value of the only one did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
The Japanese Minister of Finance Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched its two-day meeting on Tuesday, to take all possible measures leading to weakening yen.
But the multi-guverner of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had already adopted "measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Emissions increased by 5.000 billion yen (€47 billion) its purchases of Treasury Posts and increased to 55.000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts which he devoted to purchases of various securities in order to swim with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fail
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European storms still concerned about the stability of the euro area are under negative expectations today on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris at 10 hours CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The index of Dax in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions about revenues from euro area loans in difficulty, the world's share markets continue to bear only part of recent profits."
"Nervous investors only realise the risk of disease," explains Terry Pratt, broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The storm in Tokyo closed with a decline of 0.7% suffered due to the concerns of market participants in Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan as well as the rest of the world has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow variation corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area damages the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The Euro has been at the lowest level since a month and a half ago.
Within 10 hours, the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a retreat of 0.4%.
According to the Minor brokers, the party of the CDU of Chancellor Angela Merkel at its congress adopted a proposal for predicting the possibility to leave the euro area for countries that will be in difficulty without having to leave the European Union therefore.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday this morning, the revenue of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the return of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The leader of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning due to its debt.
The new Greek Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is relocated in a deliberate line of markets when elections are held in the country on Sunday to the House of Members.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
In the expectation of numbers declaring the growth of the euro area
Statistical figures say that in the third quarter, France recorded economic growth by 0.4% mainly due to household consumption, i.e. a little better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, INSEE revised the direction downwards for the second quarter to a decrease by 0,1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, it's the fourth quarter that the economists worry most.
Germany has registered growth by 0.5% on its part during the same period.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must win over dogmats
If there is a topic that cannot be taken on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for the election to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must establish their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development causes from now on to 2050 a double demand for electricity if we do not want a significant part of the world's population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, the lack of fossil resources will need to be faced in order to continue to produce electricity, while it cannot be forgotten the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is the subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not a case of Belgium, which underpins its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself by itself, nor by Switzerland, which considers it to be the right to build only power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in our projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to extend their park by one unit by renewing the construction of one plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
Berlin’s choice is shown by a healthful price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and carbon plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is taken, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind inequity, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65% or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the independence of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While globalised economy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining industry in the national territory, French companies have the advantages of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, every significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity that would make an illustrious beautiful declaration of re-industrialisation and defence of the buying force of our country.
The price that the large majority of the French are refusing to pay, as much as it is essential to oppose this energy, as this shows public opinion surveys.
Let us remind you that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 subsequent jobs.
The highly exported sector has taken a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs that cannot be transferred abroad to international markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost EUR 6 billion per year for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while the bankruptcy of his producer would be planned?
When dealing with the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, and that there is neither the devil nor the devil.
Development of equipment producing low CO2 emissions and nuclear equipment using renewable energy sources, carried out by the French AREVA industrial group, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which implements non-compromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognised have a thought of blood safety.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry met three serious accidents.
The only one in the Three Mile Island took place in normal traffic and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concepts of the reactor and the inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some of them seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the death of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this crash as much as he did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and co-operation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the applicants wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered to the competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and the release of the path to strengthen the leadership in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the emotions, dogmata and machinations to control the debate that is crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is it a burden or chance for the economy to immigrate?
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the angles of police, courts and administrations subject to the politics of calculations, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the human rights area, which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment whose object were foreign students, which became current when the Minister of the Interior (see Lebreration of 23 May) said that France" does not need foreign talents, peasants and waitresses".
But so far, it has only been settled under the angle of the economy.
It is important to say that there is a rather broad agreement between the left and the right.
On the right of the tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac declared that "9000000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million migrant workers are found" and on the left of Michel Rocard when in 1990 he said that France" cannot accept all the world's poverty."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005 the fear of the invasion of the Polish plumbers in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we deprive the immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is limited to banality when he pretends that the common development will enable our "migration problem" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be true in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall this in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.p.): there is a wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Immigration restrictions growth and employment damage.
The concerns of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than alternates for French employees by doing work in sectors with deficiencies of employees.
Small qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not sufficient to offer places.
Positive impact on wages
As a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this addition between French and migrants causes the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on wages and employment of French employees.
So Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, it does not consider the fact that the diversity of the immigrants brought contributes to the creation of thoughts and economic growth (high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems in European countries on average at 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany one immigrant will bring a net contribution to public budgets (decision minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate of wishes to come for the missing percentage of growth with valuated teeth.
The teeth mentioned for the deterrence of immigrants have had a very opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and very fragile goods too.
The European continent should remember that, although he invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, he experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some could believe that democracy would ultimately triumph over its enemies will be sufficient to make choices and make it as direct as possible.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was the ease of thinking.
General electoral law, although a condition of democracy is required, is not sufficient and may become a "depression system" as once said the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organizations and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just like that and from the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Acknowledgement of the error of the Greek referendum of the type yes- will not have the value of a double discovery in this respect: exploring the need for a great return of political power, but also revealing an alarming feeling of his impossibility, his inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought of being overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic behind have moved today and that many of the Republican warriors are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we require a number of national referendas organised according to the need and organized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolutist monarch or jumping with tied legs to the void of nationalist depth: what choice for a citizen!
No, we don't want knives of guillotines, but common, full, peaceful and continuous performance of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop the account - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is leaning in front of a dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and its lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is being humiliated on the international scene.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with each of its nations.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be urgently revoked.
For only together Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments and prepare the future by preparing investment.
The emergence from the crisis will presume decisions at European level that will not be able to be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
Following a long fight against this proposal by socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands the European Economic Government.
So be it.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new blind alley.
We must take a new step in European building.
In order to form the Republic of France, it was necessary to "be" the Republicans.
Revolution in interest couldn't be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
The chip cards are spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere, it will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world chip card fair.
In 2011, Eurosmart should end by increasing the world’s sales of cards with microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most wearable is a segment of contactless technology that allows you to pay in public transportation or to deal with purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards should be sold worldwide against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should continue to increase (prior to 580 million units) in 2012 and reach about 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC country, Europe has acquired grounds in contact with payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75.000 payment terminals receive them.
In France, the beginnings are modest: 400.000 Visa contact cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour spent 2.5 million contact cards on Pass MasterCard this year.
In order to set a higher speed level, it is necessary that from now on, the bank will address their clients.
"The two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients with dotted bank cards," reports Gérard Nébouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only the first stage to the payment of the future: the mobile phone.
The NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary for the implementation of transactions is now equipped with only a small number of instruments.
"They're late."
"But their real mood should happen next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their sales in the world of 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing forward.
Crédit agricole yesterday reported the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a desert allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, the Société geniuse announced yesterday that he was preparing to introduce a offer allowing her clients to pay with a mobile phone without touch.
The Terrorist Front touches from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the associations between Al-Kadi in Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicions that there are associations of Al-Kajd's terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram section are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Secretary of Foreign Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had been certain from now on.
"The way both organisations operate, and the intelligence reports show that there is a large co-operation between them", explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analysis.
Examining the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help light the connection bridges.
After being abducted by members of AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in surgery carried out by special French units.
The French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Teroristic axis
Analyses of calls leads to several persons in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to the Nigerian, who has long lived in Maiduguri, the city in the north of Nigeria, which is Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to the person who is known to be close to the AQMI and the cult.
"It's progress, but we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we talk about an operational co-operation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the cult has been enjoying external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," the mild statements by the Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more apparent in the development and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which, from now on, involve human victims or more complex explosive equipment of the same way of implementation as the equipment used by the AQMI organization.
Since then, the international community on the forehead with Washington has developed a pressure on Nigeria to take into consideration the problems Boko Haram brought to consideration.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded as a group as a group of enlightened mystical interests.
Quick success
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around mosques, schools and fundamentalists Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "west education is sin", approves the establishment of Islamic Emirate on the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The section is politician and requires strict respect for Islamic law of scary, while its supporters initiate the fight against the Central Government.
These people first focus on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram's leaders become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction is always the same.
The army will be surrounded by the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf cult is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group's radicalized and abandoned its position in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he will commit an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will die, then another in the capital of Abaja.
It's back in Abuja in June, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN's local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned by all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaida Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and iger and Somalia from the Al-Sabba Movement in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in emergency and is ready to send all the information.
World by candidates for the President
In questions relating to China, Iran, or helping Israel with Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they provoke in simplification and ignorance.
Can America weakened crises manage the world with simple or even simplifying thoughts?
In listening to the presidential candidates, the voters might think that.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have repeated vicious statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is already a traditionally strong point of Republican.
Often, unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or helping Israel merge among themselves.
Mitt Romney, the best placement candidate in the Republican nomination "Grand Old Party", threatened the call of the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusations for manipulation with their currency", which is a nominated topic in America with a widespread migration of the entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse, if this must include the launch of a business war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost broke down at a position that's "flaming" emotions.
He required a tough, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (current attitude of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in the last places in electoral estimates, remains unreasonable.
To the picture of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions would not succeed in stopping his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'm imprisoned by Iran," said fanfaron.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama that he had failed in his duties toward this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best positioned candidate, proves awkward ignorance of documents.
He has recently called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to develop nuclear capacities" - clearly unknown fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to hit Iran, says he's ready to send the American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They're all far away from John McCain's Republican candidate in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign politics.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan had simple thoughts, and yet he won a cold war.
They remind us that Obama was an amateur himself and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the departing boys from Iraq, his excuses for Libya and thus impress him with a weak sticker.
But the attack is not easy.
Residentship judges President Obama's national security policy, which has removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interference that leads to obstruction.
And with the arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, he knocks Obama into a better place.
Nord Stream, new port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream Remote Gas pipeline connecting directly eastern Europe to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
They must supply gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 bosses of states and governments, took part in the Nord Stream inauguration last Tuesday, a new pipeline that connects directly to Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkelová, Russian President Dmitrij Medveděv, French Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together by controlling the control valve of the Russian gas input into the Western European network.
This new gas pipeline begins to flow every year to the western Europe 27,5 billion additional cubic gas meters by the first tube of 1,224 km connecting the Petrohrad region with the mecklemburg-Pomorian Federal Land.
The second pipes to be completed at the end of 2012 will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity equal to the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility to build the third pipeline of gas pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous building has the nature of the victory.
Against the project, Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being driven by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing somewhat power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats that will close him access to the Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
The most powerfully expressed this to Warsaw when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "the new German-Soviet Pact" with appeal to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin at the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it's politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe of energy, since the project has created cracks between the east and west Europeans.
Russia managed hardly five years ago to put its vision on a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose bearings are approaching its end.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us", confirmed François Fillon at the solemn opening of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the great gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
This explains all the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in the large number of Lubmin, the gas supply place.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
Submarine pipes are made of steel equipped with concrete caps to be protected from sea vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During his construction, it was necessary to avoid mining fields coming from World War II.
"For the safety of them, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed", says Jens Müller, spokesman Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffelovek, which is nowhere interrupted at all its length, neither valves nor maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedish were only few wishes to see the Russian state society, as it continued to settle at their shore.
"In case of failures, we stop gas flow in less than 1 minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of insolvent gas contained in the gas pipeline, it shall escape into the air.
But this case is considered to be unlikely by the builders, for the weeds were designed to result in sealing once in 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline from the outside is carried out by a sub-sea robot drawn by a ship while the inside of the gas pipeline is controlled by a device which circulates inside.
This cigar shape device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
In the target of three days the speed of 3 m/s will provide accurate information on possible deformation of metal parts.
The remote gas pipeline has been designed to function for fifty years without having to be the least repair.
The circulation of gas is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in the target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The head of Gazprom remains a share of 51%.
E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as Gasunia and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a joint undertaking called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is located in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
The Gazprom subsequently rented this company for five years by a contract that could be renewed, all its gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whether the amount of real-transported gas is any," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of gas pipeline was secured from 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez Group, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will return, because the risk is taken only by Gazprom.
Gas pipeline is coming from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
A high 4,5 meter vents form an output gas gate.
The sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before being transported into the German gas pipelines.
From last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When reaching full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Tag
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to rejoice in writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent writing in the light of candles.
The Moleskine notebook is easily discernible with its black rectangle plates and its leaves blind white colors as old.
But Moleskine's notebook, such as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo located in Milan will then decide to market a new design but distributed notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant working for the company, is hereby accepted to provide a new product.
The logger is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is, for example, used to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was very valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has returned to the popularity of the old and forgotten subject, which was the icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle to 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a distant classified production from the first years in which only 3,000 subscribers have been made.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to build some artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook will take the businessman as well as the student or professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirits.
A small Italian company, who had 12 employees in his beginnings, has almost a hundred of them today and has two offices since 2008, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notes to the bookstore and through the chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the centers of cities where he could sell his identity.
"We've been tracking the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanys the development of Moleskine notebook: recently opened the exhibition" Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, at the opportunity of the film festival in Locarn, she also introduced new albums of a notebook reminiscent of leopard.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diarys, pencils, laptops ... The brand expands to a variety of carriers.
Success that raised the envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is there such a high share of unemployed hendiced workers?
Around 19% of the hendiced people are looking for work.
Today, the 15th week for employing the hendipers is open.
Despite the Voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed hendipated persons is even twice the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it skating?
"No, he underlines the Éric Blanchet, the Director-General of the Adapt Association, who organizes the week for employing the hendicepants."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"In that time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"No matter what, there is much left to do."
It should be said that there are many obstacles for unemployed hendicaped persons before their entry into work.
These are older people: 37% has over 50 years (17% average).
They have low qualifications: 80% has no graduation, and only 10,000 hendipated students from 2.4 million.
Finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in hendipeted compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment and which represent the "measure of the problem" according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of the Association of Tremplin, which was established in 1992 to assist businesses in receiving hendicaped workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unresolved ways of thinking, which certainly evolve, but too slowly.
Studies carried out in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that questioned managers have a "a weak level of knowledge of hendiced persons"" with" an overexpressed idea of persons on mobile chairs and mental or mental deficiencies."
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from achieving the objectives of employing 6% of the hendiced workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures that come from 2008, show a condition equal to 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of the Agefiph organization responsible for charging companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "peared" enterprises, as well as the paid amounts that fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ hendipted workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "How lucky"
Before Tuesday night (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have been invited to show the pleasure that will bring to them this friendly game.
We're not going so far to write that there was a merger between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the Stade de France courtyard, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the angerful gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach to his player was only praising the words.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, and the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in the club matches and the fights of the national manhood," it is one thing and the same, it is justified."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"It's necessary for me to clear my mark."
Hazard, spared against Romania on Thursday night due to this fight against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "spark."
It cannot be forgotten the concept of "happiness".
Play against Bleus, which has been encouraging for seven years and their winnings in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This essentially contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
That's more, because across the street, they're Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", reminds.
"We crucified ourselves immediately."
"I can play against them, it's just pleasure!"
Fortunately, Leekens reminded me of "creed."
"Freed" to fight the match - the holiday."
"Hartness" also states in the quality of the souseds," that France was about a year after trauma in the South African city of Knysna again became a team of very high levels."
"Laurent Blanc did a great piece of work," he took a breath.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see in 2014 on a plane with the French direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians become big," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
Including France.
Portugal very self-confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento initiates this centre in Lisbon with great optimism against Bosnia (22h00).
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
" At the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese Football Representation, which has been qualified for Euro 2012 since 2010.
Portugal divides from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
One game left and one opponent - Bosnia.
With a spinal outcome (0-0) in the Bosenian Zenice hell, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of superiority, but was unable to give such a rare goal that would make him feel better.
"It's a good result, which, however, contains a risk because we didn't put a goal out there."
But at home on their wonderful Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go before the public, which should create a boiler, even though the match appears to be very balanced," says the optimist, but the brightly thoughtful Bento.
"We're expecting a very balanced match, but we're absolutely convinced that we can have the upper side," said the two-four-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% of the chance to be on the Euro 2012," however, followed by Carlos Queiroze.
The inappropriate Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
Inappropriate match can be enough for the Bosňans who also need to score.
"It's a good result, which, however, contains a risk because we didn't put a goal out there," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and which has players with great individual quality", he added.
As in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosen team from the beginning of the maximum pressure so that" they don't give them time to think."
Good idea, subject to the fact that this time it turns out to be realistic.
