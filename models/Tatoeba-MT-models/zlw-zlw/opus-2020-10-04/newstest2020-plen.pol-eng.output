Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in the white game
He's a charismatic.
The Holy Mass of liberation and healing brings the crowds down.
He was a dozen years old when things were unexplainable in his life.
Today, through the French, others are experiencing it.
The Holy Mass of liberation and healing brings the crowds down
Once the parents of the 7-month child came to him, who had a hole in the heart of 7,5 mm.
It was supposed to be operated.
Joseph Witko's father prayed over him.
That same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Amazed orchard doctors: “The operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents were crying for happiness.
After the next prayer, the French hole disappeared completely.
The clergy extraordinary work of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In dreams, clean souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awaken at night and applied to prayer for the deceased and those who died at the time – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of a bad spirit.
And he had a vision about the man who commits the mortal sin.
“ My body began to change.
I lost my human qualities and began to pick the appearance of an animal," he says.
The invisible force lifted him up, couldn't get his voice out.
He felt lost.
Then God showed him rescue.
"Drown in the waters of the river symbolizing the sacred baptism, I was released and returned to the human character..." he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these weird experiences.
He's got an appointment.
He was 16 when he joined the French.
In preaching, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on the disposal of the disease are involved in the Mushells of Father Vitko’s healing.
Yet, the spiritualist stresses that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not physical.
First Kolping failure FRAC Jarosław
Today's (September 26th) afternoon, Kolpinga FRAC earned its current champion of Poland Dartom Bogoria Mazowiecka Grodzisk in the 3rd line of the LOTTO Superligi Tennis Stołowy.
The Jaroslavians in a personal set that they presented with the graves have no chance of winning the League sovereigns.
He showed it quite a duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team is still missing, calling for the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps in the composition of springfamousness the third time in a row of triumph in the new season would be.
I guess the young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet grown to win with thousands such as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis and the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even one of the most prospective Poles, or Mark Badowski.
The fighter from Hellady was the biggest single star in the MOSiR hall at the Sikorski street in Jarosławi.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were the class of himself.
After three Colping Monks FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei must have played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an emotional, five hundred battle – Paul Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not repay Badowski.
There will be no extra research for seniors.
Why?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a free prophylaxis for seniors of 70 and 80 years of age was expected to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented as it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and under the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariff.
The Agency explained in the justification that the target group was misleaded.
"These actions may, in fact, result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulties in access to NFZ benefits and negatively affecting the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to false positive results of research," is written.
The decision of the resort does not understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have predicted the money.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then they're going to go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it's just about leading to a situation where prophylaxis can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I don't understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I can hardly imagine that students say, "Let's not study because they'll be longer at the doctor's place, and if such specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that there is a health service in this state," he added politicians.
Palestine corresponds to Israel: We will break all the agreements we have so far
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that he would break up all agreements with Israel if the future government of this country would try to fulfill the announcement of Benjamin Netanjah on the annex of the occupied Palestinian land.
“If the Israeli government, as it will arise, proceeds to the implementation of this plan, we will abolish all the signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments taken,” he announced.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means – not to be important in this way – by fully engaged in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism", the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who has already made similar declarations in July.
Netanjahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, after the elections of 17 September, received again a government formation mission.
A week before the election, he foretold that if he would win them, he would announce the Jordan Valley annex and intend to include all Jewish settlers in Israel throughout the West Bank.
At the beginning of the 1990s, Israel and Palestinians, which was then led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements patroned by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised the United Nations General Assembly to take place on Palestinian universal elections.
The last took place in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I will convene in the West Bank, the Gaza Zone and the Eastern Jerusalem local elections and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," said the Palestinian President.
Abbas also defended Palestine's rights speech, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to exercise the powers of the UN's "full legal members and all its bodies and institutions".
The Palestinian leader ended the speech by calling for an international community to “musile Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations.”
Israel’s Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to the speech of Abbas, stating that Palestinian leader “will concentrate in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy against Israel, rather than fight against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership.”
However, Danon, as the agencies note, did not put an attachment to the occupied Palestinian lands for the announcement of Netanjahu.

105 million PLN for video games companies from the National Research and Development Centre
Almost PLN 105 million will be paid to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the III edition of GameINN.
Among almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR, the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR-based engine of the real world and the application for the transmission of data by users; the test-training platform for the verification of practical skills on the position of work and professional improvement using VR and AI technologies; the innovative simulating game for real production processes using the innovative game model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 is given in the communication of the NCBR sent on Friday PAP.
The objective of the GameINN sector is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
As the NCBR says, the Polish video games sector is growing at 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video games market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"Specially prepared GameINN research agenda, which already reaches 300 million zł support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme is an important impulse for the further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev," we read in the Communication.
The video games industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
"Innovative companies are encouraged by the government to innovate entrepreneurs, such as B+R reliefs, skills improvements programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by the NCBR, and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market", the vice-president, Minister of Science and Higher Education, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the Faculty of Science notes that the money for innovation is not only addressed to innovators in the form of project financing, but also in their pockets – with a relief to the B+R in 2018, three quarters more entrepreneurs have benefited than a year before.
"The amount of the deducted costs for R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.6 billion, which gave more than PLN 300 million to savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three GameINN editions", stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of the NCBR Dr. Jinż. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that the two previous financial contests of more than PLN 211.2 million were granted to 78 innovative projects.
The tremendous interest of the III competition and the diversity of the proposals show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to continue to develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"Specially pleases the fact that, like in previous editions, projects on solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0 are projects."
In the third GameINN competition for funding up to PLN 20 million could apply to entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs' consortia and business consortia with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of PLN 317 million.
The budget of the contest at the time the contest was announced was PLN 100 million, but it was increased and 27 projects were granted almost € 105 million.
Detailed information on the results of the III GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Game Agreement, including companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event happened on September 16th.
The Dolberg, who ended up in August from Ajaks Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch disappeared from the locker room.
Not just because it's worth $70,000.
The raged Danish didn't show up in class the next day, explaining gastric problems.
The case was mysterious from the beginning.
The pillows in the locker room have private safes and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP, he finally confessed to Diaby-Fadig.
18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the band and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danish to return the money for the watches.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to debut in the first team three years later.
He's been in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper "L'Equipe" said, the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
For the moment, he started disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
See if you're sure you're washing your hands well.
We all know that you have to wash them (e.g. after you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it in the right way.
It's especially important now that autumn infections are coming.
We need at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands to a sufficient extent.
But most of us washed them shorter.
Just warm water and normal soap – it's not true that it has to be antibacterial (a lot of doctors actually advise them).
Wash them not only with the bottoms and the top of your hands, but also: the tips of the fingers (contained or singlely) – wipe them with the cologne movements of the other hand, the spaces between your fingers (perform your hands, wiping your fingers about yourself), the thumbs – each thumb covers the other hand, and in that way we turn it in the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash your hands) we should wipe our hands with a wet handkerchief and then use the antibacterial gel (in the roads, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the washed handles or doors (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspector).
Open it through a paper towel.
The President of Iran says he rejected the offer of talks from the United States, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not speak to the American party during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the offer of Americans to abolish sanctions, said President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian party asked to remove the restrictions he refused to accept.
According to the President of Iran, Hasan Rowhani, the Americans proposed to abolish all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the programme for the construction of ballistic missiles.
Rowhani: Iran will not make talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said that he refused to take these discussions because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he had met with American diplomats because he had been targeted by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he underlined that Iran would not make "maximum pressure" calls.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in format 5+1, no one can predict the final outcome," Rowhani said.
A day earlier, Iranian leader said that he did not exclude the talks from the US, and the European sides of the nuclear agreement rejected favouring the US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the US's speech from the nuclear agreement "is a precondition which does not allow" to be set up a dialogue.
If we can endure this prerequisite, and if America can lift sanctions and pressure, then of course, we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to this conversation during the UN General Assembly last week.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no.”
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the request of the Iranian party.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said "no!" the president of the United States.
Tension with a nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to mitigate the tensions between Washington and Tehran to save an agreement with Iran from 2015, which were signatories.
It stated that, in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would resign from the nuclear weapon construction programme and the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the United States withdrawn from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.
It hasn't worked yet.
Washington applies the tactics of exercising maximum pressure on Iran and sanctions include the full embargo for Iranian oil.
Teheran announced that if he had not received an export authorisation of the raw material, every 60 days it would restrict its commitments resulting from the agreement.

According to its words and screens from WhatsAppa, the Judge of the Administrative Court of Warsaw and the husband of the Emilia, who, according to its words and screens, participated in stalking against the judges, was restored on Wednesday to the NSA’s judgment.
The reason: there is no disciplinary procedure for him, so there is no reason to support the management of the President of WSA Wojciech Mazur to withdraw it from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary ombudsman at the NSA, started an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not been transformed up to now in opposing him.
Although the NSA, in such cases as a disciplinary court, must take care of the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its issue.
In this situation, a judge who publicly talked about the mental problems of his wife to discredit her, who, because of the suspicion of participation in the hejter group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Polish Republic.
Judge Szmydt denies his share in the heyter group.
He claims that there is no evidence but the false screens and the words of his wife, with whom he divorces.
That is exactly what other judges claim to be related to the “Kasta”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll put on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't use her finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, he's also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, who kept that phone in June on a different case.
The police didn't use their fingers to secure the devices of persons who, as persecutors, pointed out the February Judge Waldemar Żurek.
There is no evidence – no problem of Smydt, no problem of "Kasty".
There is also no case of the Chief of the NIK Marian Banasia about renting the building to the baseors and hiding income.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And he'll check when he's checked out.
However, the Poselian Ethics Commission will not take care of Banas because Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered together to make a curious decision to revoke Banasia's alternates and appoint as his lawyer, although the law of such a surprising combination does not provide for).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie story, an American guess about how my wife comes home and gets married to her lover in bed.
She's so astonished and devastated that she can't shout a word.
She's standing in the door, she's going down, and at that time, the lover jumps out of bed, dresses up and leaves.
And the husband's bed was broken.
When his wife gets her voice back and screams, what is this?
Who is this woman?
Husband's quietly asking, "What woman, honey?"
The only thing about "Kasty" or Banasia is the state parody.
And that's not funny at all.

Morawiecki's cornel is in a hospital in a heavy state
He hit the hospital, and his doctors call it heavy.
You have to add that he's conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will come to win again.
We all pray that he may return to health," said the anonymous close person of Cornel Morawiecki in a conversation with the journalists "Super Express".
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister is running for the Senate.
"The next family and politics hold me alive," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview, which he gave to the journalists "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” informed that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to research at the Military Hospital in Wroclaw.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I volunteered to the hospital.
It turns out I have a jaundice.
But the worst thing was in front of me.
When a C.T. test was performed, my pancreatic tumour was found...", the prime minister's father passed.
A few days later, at the hospital of MSWiA in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal bandman to the hospital of Zbigniewa Kras.
The operation lasted about three hours, and it was successful.
“I know that many people have prayed for me for what I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to go through chemo.
I'm in the hands of specialists who're more of a good idea.
Now, after this heavy operation, I have to go back to some state of use.
I hope everything's going to be okay," he pointed out in January the Moravecki Cornel in a conversation with "SE".
"If I were too late to study, the situation would be tragic and I'd say goodbye to this fall...", he added.

The power of the Elephant jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports contests, played on Sunday afternoon on September 15th on the hypodromy on Oleandra Street in Olawie, may be for some misleading.
For the real power of the road is far away, but this is the name of one of the kinds of horse competition...
The competition of the power of jumps is to overcome by the rider and horses increasingly obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed two meters.
It is worth adding that the long-term and still unbearable record of the world, established in 1949 by the Chilian Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
Of course, no one jumped so high in Oława, but the score of the best local ammonium at 135 cm is also not the worst...
The contests organised by the unfair John Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS “In the saddle” were a demonstration of some of the previously played “Food Riding professions” on page 22.
There were eight amazons who trained riding in the Olavski JKS.
Four of them competed on kucks, four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szoldra was best done, getting a crazy "Sprinter."
This small, but how dynamic the rumak began from overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and he only ended up at a station with a top barrel separated from the ground by 125 cm.
However, it did not easily and only after three further refusals were removed by the jury from further competition.
The second place in the ponies took Amelia Pawlak and the third Lena Boruń on the "Harmidera" was "Amelia Pawlak".
She was ambitiously fighting the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through the obstacles on the little Carmen.
Even more emotions were accompanied by starters of amazons and viewers during the competition with large horses.
Paulina Szewczyk, arriving “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who went to "Lotce".
Fortunately, besides small cuts or amazons, nothing bad happened to horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of a young "Wineta" at the parker had her seated by Veronica Łukiewicz.
She was either a trainer's assistant, or another horse to a pair, where she got a little crazy "Winet" behind.
After taking the barriers from the park, she also took off with a full power, so the moments in boxing and the relaxing room were dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, John Sienkiewicz calmed some of these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the big horse competition at the park, Marta Masalska has been a great place to sit beautifully presenting "Whisky".
This handsome, couple with experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at this point.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also included the same height on "Deklaration", Veronika Łukiewicz on "Wine" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotce".
To the decoration of floo and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these players went together, and at the end, together with the pony amazons in the soccer march of Radecki made an effective round of honor, ending with these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thank you
The Jezdec Sport Club “In Siodle” warmly thanks the sponsors of the contesting power of the jump during the 17th "Mustang Nuts": the Urban Office in Oława, the Wodociąg Zakład and the Canalisation in Oława, the District Mayor and the Mustang company.
Max Collonko is separated from KW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Koloko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which political formation #R Revolution Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution has directed its proposal in particular to young electorates on the right views.
Before the elections of Kolonko, he announced to cooperate with Mark Jacobiak, or Paul Kukiz, but to any of these coalitions, and the Patriotic KWW Revolution of Max Kolonko himself could not even collect enough signatures to put a list in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed Twitter that he had finished his cooperation with the Patriotic KWW Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I'll be expecting in/in the KWW to delete my name from the name.
I would like to ask you not to join my person with the entity in/in the above mentioned," he added and announced that he would give more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his action, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution.
On July 4, at the American Independence Day, a journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko informed about the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has heard from running on YouTube channel Max TV, which commented on events in Poland and the world.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to embrace the nation and rule for the good of the nation," said Kolonko.
The game programme includes, inter alia, issues relating to judiciary (made in general elections), tax changes (equalification of the amount free of tax for all), reparations (in the form of military assistance for the eastern NATO flank countries, with special emphasis on Poland), the conduct of a referendum on arms possession, the reduction of Members or the introduction of one-mandatous electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko put on his profile in social media information suggesting that #R will connect forces with Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have ultimately happened.
UBS: Golden near the balance point
"The euro course will be maintained in the next few months in the area of a ceiling of 4.35 zł, which will be accompanied by a weak competition on global markets", said Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a robust economic growth and stable monetary policy are speaking for stabilising the gold quotations at the current ceiling", assesses the specialist in the discussion with Bankier.pl.
He believes that despite the clear inflation pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to increase the footholds in the environment in which the huge majority of central banks mitigate policies.
"If the gold is properly valuated, the euro quotations should continue in the next months in the area of the ceiling of 4,35 zł, the Polish bonds are not attractive enough.
More favourable viability from Polish papers offers bonds from emerging markets", reports Michael Bolliger, the head of the allocation of assets to markets that are emerging in the company of UBS Wealth Management.
According to specialists, the main threat to the Polish economy is to deteriorate the world’s economy.
"Global slowdown may still be deeper, but there should not be a severe recession, and at the most, the rise of GDP dynamics slightly below zero," said Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should be deprived of global actions which may harm the lack of prospects for dealing with the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be maintained relatively weakest," results from the latest letter to the investors of the main manager of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"Euro-area stocks should behave worse than Americans because they are more vulnerable in terms of increased uncertainty about global trade and fears against slowing," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the safest country bond markets has pushed the profitability of the German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the viability.
However, long-term viability of long-term papers should no longer fall, but only short-term, by mitigating the monetary policy of banks.
The largest area to the fraction of the foot has the Fed, which should lead to the weakening of the American currency in the horizon of the following years.
The long-term balance point for euro quotations is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean the 19% potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fedu's feet, which will result in a decrease in monetary policy in the world.
"To maintain the dollar's power in a long time may not allow deficits on the current and budget account," said Michael Bolliger.
Bundeswehra loses weapons.

The vice-president of the party, Martin Renner, expressed concern to the situation.
As she said to the RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “restraint.”
Moreover, as the investigations resulted, only a part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarised the effects of these actions as a "fair balance".
It also criticized the fact that the report did not indicate whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehra Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the State and violation of the laws governing access to firearms.
The Officer was rejected to prepare the bombs on top German politicians from extreme legal and racist motives.
His “black list” of targets, which came into the hands of the prosecutor, were, among other things, the Minister of Justice of Heiko Maas of SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, defending human rights and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. has illegally entered the possession of four firearms, over 1000 ammunitions and over 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How do you avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the web pages, the line allows you to check the locations on the plane.
If the combination is travelling minors to the second year of age, the “children’s lamb” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or seating guards.
Thus, the operator of the service of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place away from the small man.
The BBC states that the lines have already informed of the imperfection of this solution.
“The child’s Icon” will not appear when the ticket was reserved by a third party or if the last minute the plane has changed.
As you could expect, the idea shared the internauts.
Some Twitter users indicate that the issue of travelling with crying children can be solved by means of noise-reduced headphones.
They're children, we used to be them too.
"We must learn tolerancy, because soon we will need a map of seats for breathing lips, snooping or drunks," wrote G Sundar.
Another internaut noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying children on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There are also no supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me from screaming children during a 13-hour journey," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major counts losses after bankruptcy of travel offices Thomas Cook
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not be here in October for a vacation to Majorka as a result of bankruptcy on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
As he informed on Friday, the representative of the autonomous government of Balearów Marc Pons, among the 25,000 magazines, who will not be able to benefit from the October leave at Majorce, are also those who were to travel with indirectly related companies with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
The Pons explained that 80% of the expected periodicals, who had to resign due to the british bankruptcy of the company, were German citizens and Scandinavian countries next month.
However, as Pons says, since Thomas Cook did not lead tourists to the island of ballears during the November-quin period, the losses for the local economy will be lower.
He pointed out that the Balearov government had already launched negotiations with international operators on the "Marners' market entry" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
From the estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca" shows that in October, more than 1,000 people will lose their job due to the tourism crisis at Majorce.
About 800 are fired employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palm.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many hotels, Majorka owners of facilities requested from guests to pay additional accommodation fees.
This situation has experienced, among others, dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearov Government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorce have stopped activities at least by the end of October in connection with the notice of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and the cooperating companies.
In turn, the Friday journal “Diario de Ibiza” indicates that most of the hotels in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group are not intended to close the establishments in the next few weeks.
The paper reminds me that on this Balear Island, the British bancher collaborated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearów's autonomous authorities announced that the Spanish Government would be asked to support the region by EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They have revealed that the most damaged tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, is located on Majorka.
According to the Balearov Government data, Thomas Cook is delayed by local tourist companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of the agreements for the July-September 2019 period about EUR 5 million.

“Rz”: Smog has committed government
"The effects of the "Clean Air" programme are thin, and the carbon pieces will kick this winter like nothing," we read on the first page of today's "Rzeczpolitan".
The ‘Clean Air’ programme has so far been submitted to 82,000 applications for funding of PLN 2 billion, of which 48,000 were positive.
The accepted proposals totally support more than PLN 915 million, says "Rz", referring to the data from the Ombudsman of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only some of the costs are reimbursed from the programme.
The results of the foretold scum of the program are judged by the journal as "score".
Self-government, quoted by the "Rz", is viewed by the failures of "Clean Air" including in too much bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, post invoices sent, possible sampling of implementation.
This would make things better," says Mayor Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alert point out that less than 1% of the target of the exchange of 3 million boilers have been achieved in the first year.
As pointed out by the ‘Rz’, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion per 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for Environment and Water Economy for this year, 1,4 billion PLN were reserved," we read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Blizzard: Now the price negotiations
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 modern F-35 aircraft.
“It is one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but not the end of our work,” wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will be hard to negotiate to achieve the most advantageous price," said the Polish Minister.
Polish F-35 Agreement
The Polish air force is designed to boost 32 F-35 Lightning II hunters produced by the company Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US Department agreed to sell Poland.
The Communication stresses that the investment will support national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of NATO alliance, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department information, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department has pointed out that the contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, as well as the related elements of logistics and programme support and training.
Squadron Lockheed Martin F-35
Squad F-35 Lightning II produced by the company Lockheed Martin is a one-time and one-engine hunter of a multi-associated fifth generation.
The plane is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombing and typically hunting tasks.
Thanks to stealth hunter technology, it is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, F-35 hunters bought Belgium as a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace them with the ageing F-16.
The purchase of American fighting aircraft is also intended to consider other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer of Barbie put a series of neutral dolls on the market sexually.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
The manufacturer of Barbie put a series of neutral dolls on the market
Next to Barbie with different color of skin, figures or haircuts, Mattel introduced neutral dolls to sale sexually.
Toys from the series "Creatable World" bear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the midst of the dolls, the girls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colours and with different clothes.
It has also been abandoned by emphasizing the characteristic of sex – gender dolls no longer have full mouth, long eyelashes and thin plates or, in the case of Ken, wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have sex standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a particular sex are hampering the girls' ambitions and strengthening traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a high heel bathing suit and shoes, was repeatedly criticized for propagating “healthless women’s stereotypes”, such as an unnatural proportion of the body.
Concern has responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijaba.
Zandberg: wheel or club Together can have a dozen Members
Zandberg asked in the ZET radio , how many candidates of his party can get to Sejmu from the list of left groups (KW SLD from whose letter the candidates are running to Sejm SLD, Spring and Leftki Together, starting with the common logo "Lewica"), replied that it depended on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the Lewica's result will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that Lewica is not only right, but has the strength," he pointed out.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 Members.
“This may mean that the wheel or the club together will have a dozen Members.
But it depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell you how this happens," he said.
Asked whether Lewica would have a separate circle, Zandberg said: “We are arranged to be varied, and we will not pretend that there is no diversity.
I think that the Poles' diversity was rewarded because we showed that differently, we were able to deal with the common programme."
The question is whether the largest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he believed the largest beneficiaries were the Centrolewic and left voters.
On the other hand, the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, said, “the purpose of the political party is to represent its voters.”
Zandberg admitted he'd vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he pointed out he was wondering.
"The offer is varied and there are candidates and candidates, to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further to," he said.
"I say very honestly and clearly that if I had found myself in Senate District 44, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district," he stressed politics.
"I wouldn't have tempted myself to vote for Minister Kazimierz Udivski (Kandidina KO-PAP)", he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leaders of the RP Citizens Paul Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki of PiS start.
Dakar: The largest mosque in Western Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered together on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in Western Africa.
Muslims came by buses, cars and foot to the Bopp district, where the new mosque could hold 30,000 faithful.
The object was built by the Mouride bracelet, which belongs to the Sufitic Nut of Islam, which is dominated in Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area with six hectares, submitted by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan Mosque (the paths to paradise) comes from the title of the line of Ahmdou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th century founder of the brotherhood, honored by the worshipers as a saint.
The mosque is carrarian marble and has five miners.
The highest one is 78 meters away.
The mosque in the middle of the 15,000 faithful towns, and the other so much can be on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the golden dome, giant gigantic gigantic gigantic gigantic and hand-made decorations made by workers from Morocco.
Builders say that the mosque is the largest in Western Africa, but there is no comparison to mosques in other regions anyway.
In Morocco, the Hassana II mosque in Casablance can hold 105,000 faithful.
The construction of a mosque, which cost more than €30 million, was financed by private donations.
The government, besides the earth, has funded lighting, sanitation equipment and financed roadworks of EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smyla: Our problem is not Silesia, only us alone
The Pass of eight League matches without the victory of the Corona footballer will try to stop in Friday meeting with the vice-lider of the Extraclasses of Śląska.
"Our problem is not a returning problem, we alone have to work on what we play," stressed the Claus of Mirosław Smyla.
The balloons of the Corona last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first line when they defeated the 1:0 barrel of the Raków Częstochowa.
Later, the qualities recorded two draws and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Zagłęb Lubin in 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
"I am optimistic about the fact that in the last seconds, the fighters fought for the gate, wanted to remission.
Their fall on the muraw after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smyla.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be allergic to the game in the side field sectors.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play," the coach added.
In the Friday match in the Crown, it will certainly not be playing a stopper for the excess of the yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, in the cadddle also lacks the contusions of James Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
But it's building up to report to several players with a willingness to play in the cup game.
"We have headaches, recently it seemed like he was gone, and now he is," said Smyla.
The defender of Korona Daniel Oddniel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without a victory, but in extraklasa each can win with each one.
"We are a good team.
In the last few weeks, we may not show it on the field, but this is the moment that we're going to win and we believe it's going to be on Friday."
After nine lines of extraclasses of the Koron with a total of five points, the 15th position takes place.
The Silesia gathered 12 more, and it scrubs in the other place.
The fifth game in Kielce starts at 8:30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of tree species consisting of a tree of Europe is at risk" warns the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) published on Friday "The Red Paper of European Trees".
At the top of the list, there are, among others, coughs and yorks.
IUCN, an organisation established in Gland in Switzerland, publishes a list of the threatened European tree species for the first time.
It was drawn up by specialists who, on the basis of research, concluded that from 454 trees in Europe (and other places in the world) 42% were "grossed to a high degree".
Among the reasons, the Red Paper lists the rapid growth of urban agglomeration and global climate change.
However, the most threatened are the trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As regards typical European trees, 58% of the IUCN specialists are at risk and 15% of the species, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are endangered.
Among the main causes of the deforestation, the Red Paper lists the errors in the operation of the trees, the accelerated urbanisation, the too intense cut of trees, and further fires of forests and changes in European eco-stystem.
According to the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosquitoes and growth is also strongly at stake.
"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European species of plants and create in Europe the danger of extinction of important and underestimated varieties, which are the basis for European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet", summarised the report by Luc Bas, which leads the European IUCN offices.
Grzegorz Schetin: I won't promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to redeem the Poles, offering them the freedom of redemption for credit that will have to pay for future generations," says Grzegorz Schetin in an interview for "Rzeczpolitan".
He believes that "the whole PiS policy is pic".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken".
Schetine ensures in a conversation with Jackie Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea of defeating the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilising the elect at the electoral urns.
He believes that the opposition has more potential in this respect than the Kaczyński Party.
"Today conscious people who want to live in a normal country are more than supporters of the PiS, a party who has committed to preaching values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetine.
The leader of the Citizens Coalition and the president of the Citizens Platform also identified the basic assumptions of the KO election programme.
"First, nothing that is given will be taken, but it has to be a guide for the future, because PiS deals exclusively with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is seen after dramatically low investments," said.
Secondly, it is “the launch of the Poles' energy, the help and investment in those who work well - and those who are entrepreneurs.”
The Schetine explains that in the KO programme there was a project, which, among others, will give the least earning Poles more about 614 gold on hand and more earnings – also for a few hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he didn't want to race for the news.
As he said, he'll do as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow a Greek variant, where the rulers were biding with the opposition to the decree until the financial collapse of the country has finally occurred," he stressed.
Schetine in an interview for “Rz” also said that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to discuss with him and Margaret Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would have exposed their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“The pride walks before the fall.
Kaczyński is the man of the state like Banas is crystal," he added.
The leader of the PO also said that he had not yet decided to apply for the Presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six dead condors were found – reports TVN24.
Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The great condors were probably poisoned by means of killing predators like pums, foxes, and wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten toxic padlin.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were grown.
“This is a great loss for the environment because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and reproductive.
So we lose a protected species, a species at risk," says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine Environmental Organisation.
"I think that the use of toxic bait and poison is not only at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health, adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the President
Work has taken place to grant the head of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Dudy – we read in the "Rzeczpolitan".
As the newspaper explains, this is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignium officially called the period of interwarly jewelry of the Republic of Poland.
The last time he used it was probably the President of Ignacy Mościcki.
‘Rz’ states that such a chain may soon be hit by the arms of Andrzej Dudy.
The Senate Commission of Human Rights, Regulatory and Petitions voted on Wednesday's request to work on the amendment of the Law on Orders and Decrees to restore it.
The journal says it's not also the first attempt to restore this chain of state's head.
The Senate has already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it has fallen one vote.
This time, work is lightning.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted this matter a few minutes, considering that they would consult the President's Chancellery.
This one came in mid-September.
"I am politely informed that the President's office of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in the petition," wrote the President's Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee continued to spend a little time on the matter.
"President's office briefly answered us: he's behind bringing it back," said the Chief of Committee Robert Mametow of PiS, quoted by the "Rz".
It submitted a request for legislative work supported by the Commission.
The police will teach drivers how to drive through crossroads
Political action will be conducted, among other things, on the intersection of Al. Cieplinski from Al. Piłsudski.
The uniform activities are similarly related to recent complaints from the city’s drivers that are not always able to behave properly on the crossroads.
On Friday, September 27th, the police are starting the preventive action of the Cross- crossings in Rzeszów.
It is to eliminate traffic obstacles: crossing without exit possibility, non-compliance with light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone on the crossing, and we actually make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words were rigged at the press conference of the city hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movements of cars after crossings, resulting in corridors.
Then the president called on travellers for reason on the road and, among others, faster moving on lights or not writing texts while driving.
The theme was taken over by the Russian police who started the "Cruise Crossing" action from today.
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of restriction of crossings by drivers entering them without continuing driving.
This is a frequent offense that helps to strengthen the obstacles to traffic and the creation of traffic traffic.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 zł and 2 criminal points.
In addition, the uniform will pay attention to the non-application of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the crossing area.
They will also observe the lack of liquidity of driving, the late shift from the signals, the free crossing and leave too much distance between the vehicles.
How will the crossings be carried out?
Among others, on the street of Lisa-Kuli of Jagiellonska, al. Cieplinski of Al. Piłsudski; ul. Targa z al. Piłsudskiego; Placu Śrniewitów z ul. Dąbrowskiego or Hetmanskiego Street of Al. Powstańców Warszawy.
Such shares in the capital of Podkarpacia will be held on the next Friday of October.
They've checked a company that planted waste from "Twasks"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Affairs of the Wołomiński and Powiatowy Inspection of Construction Supervisory inspected the installation in the village of Zielonka, where waste from sewage treatment "Czajka" in Warsaw is dissolved," said the Ombudsman of Volomiński Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors of Volominian mayor carried out control in the forests belonging to the municipality of Green.
The private establishment of ‘Dar-Trans’, according to the agreement with the table sewage treatment plant ‘Cuba’, makes waste management services available.
‘The installation was examined, in addition, the trader was asked to provide the documentation related to its activities,’ said Szyszko.
He added that the audit report would be submitted, among other things, to the Warsaw Military Environment Inspector.
The last inspection in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Military Environment Inspector in Warsaw during the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not take samples, measurements and studies of groundwater and did not have the results of the surveys of stable municipal sewage sewage sewage sewage settlements from the sewage treatment plant.
Following the WIOS control of Dariusz Sobota, it was called to cease the infringement of the terms of the decision.
DAR-TRANS Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stable municipal sewage settlements from the ‘Czajka’ cleaning room.
In accordance with the decision to conduct waste disposal in the field of the product, wastes of up to 60,000 tonnes per year are processed in the forests near Green.
The Warsaw City Company of Vodociągs and Canalisation informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 it was excluded from the operation by the STUOS, which was associated with damage to one of the incinerators.
As the MPWiK informed, the monthly export cost is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Wałęsa's leash supported Margaret Kidawa-Blonska.
"You have undergone a difficult task, you can count on my total support," said Lech Wałęsa to Margaret Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me," said the candidate of the Citizen Coalition to the Prime Minister, leader of the list KO in Warsaw.
The former president underlined that as far as the situation is concerned in Poland, it is now “only a fan of retirement”.
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office in the Danish European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
The son of Wałęsa, Jarosław, took part in a short conversation behind the closed door.
"You've done a difficult job," said after you met Lech Wałęs.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to us all.
Therefore, the great hope that you as a woman deal with these problems, and we all, those who love Poland, will support your action," said the former president, referring to Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
"Mr. President, this is a very important word for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, the constitution and know what it's important," she said.
“Let's show that you can do another, smart policy together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
You did this to your revolution, and we want to change Poland," said Kidaw-Błoński.
Retirement Kibic
In a chat with the journalists he said he's now "only a fan of retirement."
“ Of course, I am looking at it.
I hope that we turn the course of events back, that what was good, we will test it.
The three division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all of this needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe we're gonna do it this time.
'Cause if we don't, we're going to have a street criterion,' Lech Wałęsa said.
“That is why the Poles are so important that they choose, consider themselves and make a decision.
And that's the most important thing," she added Kidaw-Błoński.
"The last chance of improving the state of things in Poland," said the former president.
"We have to build a new foundation"
The question about the most important changes that should be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “Mr. President has said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no three divisions of power, since the Constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move forward."

According to the relationship of people at class, the world champion trainer was nervous.
As the assistant Heynena Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of retinal elements itself.
"We went to the hall, but in the determined majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending more together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“ We have been brutally brought to the ground.
No doubt we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to this game.
We've been discussing this game between each other in the staff, the coach has talked a lot to the players.
As two main causes of failure, I would point to the ineffectiveness of the attack and much worse than usually dealing with the situation balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us," he analyzed.
He believes that the White-Baied has not stood in the obstacle of stress, related to the performance of the opposed to a loud and numerous publicity of the co- hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that world champions could have had a little bit of a smooth way to the semifinal.
“Maybe if we had a failure in a group phase in a similar way, we'd be quicker to analyze this lesson and then we'd play another game in the next phase of the tournament.
But it's just shit," he said.
Gogol hopes that anger related to the fourth failure of Poles will be able to spill into aggression in the bronze match.
“I hope that we will then show our true faces.
There's nothing to fight about.
The last time we fought the medal of ME in 2011, he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase, they rivald in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group phase, they went to Apeldoorn, and they moved to Lublana.
Nick Kyrgyzs: severe punishment but in suspension
The Australian tennisist received a 16-week ban on launches and a fine of $25,000 in a half-year suspension – for vast words, gestures and actions during the recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience to Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the offences of the most uncircumcised professional tennisist in recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks of breaks plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a skewed athlete can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been working for a long time and gaining a specific tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behaviour on the court and next to him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsport behavior, insulting judges and viewers, breaking two missiles during the defeated match with Karen Chaczanow – for all this after August ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019, he also did not play a long time, but he had to publicly say that the ATP activists were “corrupted”, which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they carried out a disciplinary investigation against Kirgia and then a few weeks later, the said verdict on suspension of starts and subsequent fines.
However, the words of corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and understanding of the context of the statement.
However, the tennis activists claimed that the investigation showed that the behaviour of Kyrgios throughout the past 12 months in many cases had been serious objections and was almost continuously infringing the rules that he was constantly defending a vulgar person related to tournaments and viewers, thus a high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately defer the execution of the judgment by ordering to fulfil in the next six months a few conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy missiles, fight with judges and the public, nor any other way to act unfairly and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek “strengthful support” from mental trainers during the tournaments and also to consult those who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who do not deal with proper behaviour.
The first comment (in social media) Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: “Hey, everyone, I still can play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, since in Laver’s Cup, he was injured to a bar injury, so he had to give up the nearest starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
In the ATP Kyrgios ranking, it takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he'll have a lot left.
GUS: Poland is getting better and better
From the report published on Friday by the GUS on household budgets, it shows that, as a good or rather, its material situation, it was estimated at up to 44% of them.
The year earlier was 37.2%, 33.5% in 2016, and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
As a bad or rather bad material situation, 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% of the year earlier and over 20% in 2009, were considered to be a total of 8.1% of households.
The best is the material situation of households working on their own.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents think it was good or rather good.
On the second gear there are households of rencists, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
It is the worst for parents to raise their own offspring, of which a good or rather material situation declares 32%.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (as depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60% and between households without children is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly see the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst material situation the parents evaluated the self - upbringing offspring and the multitude (with at least three children).
Improved subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflect a rapid increase in income, especially from work.
However, this is not all because the percentage of households that are considered to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodship, there is no clear dependence on the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments form Opole Voivodship residents, where their situation is a good or rather good one of 48.9% of the investigated.
There are further orbital voivodships (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and West Pomeranian (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolska, the orderable income (i.e. after the payment of taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusk.
The highest revenues had the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%).
In Poland, the average orderable income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after a price change adjustment) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
It's a pretty low result in previous years.
In 2016, income to the person increased by 7% and a year later by 6,3%.
Although the increase in revenue slows down, it also inhibits the increase in expenditure.
These in terms of a person came from 1187 zł, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
It's the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure on the person increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
The surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household is currently spending 70.1% of its orderly income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and up to 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three seafarers committed suicide last week on a ship of USS George H. W. Bush – informed the American Navy.
Over the last two years, five crew members have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
As CNN says, all three sailors were shot last week.
Every event happened on the land when the USS George H. W. Bush was on the coast of Virginia.
To date, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, deaths are not to be linked.
“It needs everyone to engage in presenting suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to emphasise that there is no stigmatisation or other repercussions related to the search for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, the ship commander on Facebook.
Impressively critical about the pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In his conversation with Peter Lekszycki Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"In fact, each of his opinions were accepted."
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to dispose of the harmful activities of the Ridzy, he was a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this editor of the Church and Poland - has developed his media in the best of the Pope Pope's life," explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were dissatisfactions, the Pope said something, once he did not accept Ridzyk, but he had the power and politician could simply throw him out of the Church or send him to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
But John Paul II did not do that, like his successor," explained Niesiołowski.
“There has also been this terrible issue of paedophilia and the activities of the Church, and in fact their lack.
I've gone a little ahead of my mind, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We've known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
There is a question of how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters," he spoke to the journalist Niesyołowski.
In the assessment of the former Polish politician, the Church is an ally of PiS.
“We must admit that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, the crosses hanged everywhere.
Now these crosses are sandy, become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat, one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Ridzyk are shaking the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing about this matter and that today the Church is the ally of PiS.
It is the black chapter of the Polish Church, which will pay the sun for him", convinced Niesłolovski.
"I hope that Pope Francis is chasing Jędraszewski, Rydzyk, and a few others like this," he summarized.

The PZPN is punishing the hens on the stadiums.
Risk Disqualified
Staring in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk with a small hair didn't end tragically when it was fired by the fans of Wejher raca about millimeters passed by the opponent team goalkeeper, Zlatana Alomerovicia.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee examined this case has given Gryf a severe penalty, excluding it from the future games.
The club will not be able to start the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the fans will not be released in the nearest match on their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to the league games by 31 December either.
Burdy on the stadium of Widzewa Łódź also called the Silesia Wroclaw fans.
However, here the judgment of PZPN was milder because Silesia had warned that similar events could occur and the competent authorities were allergic to this issue.
Nevertheless, the services have allowed the shipping sector to be thrown away by the rats, the ignition of chairs and the fortification of the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use an aquatic army.
PZPN punished Silesia with a single ban on stadium in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organizing of trips to matches in this and the next issue of PP.
The ban on departures also covered the expedition matches, but it will take until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange the labelling across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rivers
In Podkarpacie, the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure started to be renewed on foreign cities on road signs, including in Polish.
For example, "Lov" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, readier and simpler.
The new guidelines are based on the revision of the Infrastructure Minister's Regulation on the detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.
"We should remember that the names of the village in the neighbouring countries are often Polish.
Thanks to the changes we have prepared in the law, they will finally appear on the roads on our roads.
The introduction of a new label begins with the subcarpac section of the A4" motorway, informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
The changes will be introduced at 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand zloty.
In the first place, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
How is the idea supposed to be realizing?
It'll be without the exchange of boards, on the base of the sticker.
They will now replace the new name of the villages, which are written in Polish on the marks already existing.
Both names will be saved in one row – first in Polish, and then in the original, in the bracket.
This will be a great facilitation for people who do not know the names of foreign cities in the language of the country where they are located.

Someone shot the swan from the windmill.
In the pond in Zameczo in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants saw a swan having problems with the wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had made an animal a purpose – in his body the windmill was found.
“Information about the injured birds has been received from the villagers of the Centre for Rehabilitation of Wild Animals in New Soli.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was right to see that there was something very wrong with him.
We acted fast and precisely so we wouldn't hurt him and put him on extra stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first shot of the RTG, it was already known that someone made a gunshot shield of it.
In his body there were slices of the steak," says Marcin Walasek, President of Malpol, managing the rehabilitation centre, among others.
It's cold in the centre.
"The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the centre where it will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He's not able to fly yet.
The release now would be associated with the fact that he would probably not survive the winter," says Walasek.
Personnel after the swan of rehabilitation intends to release him to the same pond in spring.
The authorities of the Municipality of Żukowice after receiving information about the cause of animal health, they intend to inform the Prosecutor of the case.

Gowin: “We must stimulate Polish, small trade”
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will need to be considered whether you have any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Chairman of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
During the conversation in the “Sylls of the Day” in Radio One said that trade is controlled by international networks that impose so low margins to Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot develop.
The vice Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to face this at the very beginning of the term of office, but he got a "contour from the EC".
"We won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Rights wins the nearest elections, and the government will form, we will go back to this subject," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that “the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of the Polish, thus small trade.”
"This will have to wonder whether the government, the state has some instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.
In May, the EU court concluded that the European Commission made a mistake stating that the Polish retail tax is unacceptable public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act assumed the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% from the revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% from the revenue of PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was intended to apply since September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated an infringement procedure by Poland.
Brussels argued that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It subsequently concluded that the tax was implemented in an unlawful manner.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until the officials in Brussels have completed their analysis.
Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU Court opened the way to reintroduction, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal in the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSUE press service provided PAP that the matter is now in writing, where both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
For the moment, it is not known whether or not the procedure, namely hearing the parties and possible trial.
The need for a few to a few months after an appeal has been lodged.
"This is the average year," said the PAP source in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How do you dress a child for christening?
We are building up a few practical solutions
Christianity is an extremely important ceremony in the child's life and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity to focus on the whole family around the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.
So it's not surprising that the freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best in the day.
However, before you and you make the final decision about the baby's dress, consider whether it'll also be comfortable.
In stores you can find a lot of machine sets that do not provide a tiny comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a dress to baptism is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks were baptized in white sets and placed in the same barrels or large pillows.
Today, children approaching the sacrament are often older: several months, annual, or even larger.
It's not hard to imagine that such a great comfort needs a little more clothes to be baptized.
So if your child is 3-4 months baptized, he will probably spend the ceremony in the cart or on the hands of his parents or the baptismal.
The best way to do is to put it in comfortable cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this component of the dressing is recognised as a daily outfit, it is enough to find its sacred variants, for example with a wave bank or a lace.
For the boy, it will be perfect for points with the print of the mushroom and glaze.
In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasies in your dress.
The girl's gonna look pretty in a simple, tile dress.
Many of the parents of the girls with a pity looks towards the richly won, fake dresses for baptism in a complex with planes, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, non-smoking materials in which the child is simply inappropriate.
In the search of the suitable clothing, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant dresses for cotton threads.
Delicate, tiulet skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and lovely complexes will make your little girl look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys’ parents had a fashion in their suits, a copy of “adult” models.
Polyester navy and trousers, rigid collars or helmets often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were cast out by comfortable cotton complexes.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, jersey pants, and to this blouse decorated from the front on the vest pattern.
These machines look extremely refreshing, but at the same time they don't embarrass the movements of the little world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a property statement
Krystyna Pawłowich made a statement of property at the end of the term of office.
It turns out that Ms PiS has collected 110,000 zł savings.
Remind us that Paulovich had foretold to leave politics.
With the end of the term, it has a total of PLN 110,000.
According to the statement made by the messenger, it draws up a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Paulowicz has a flat of PLN 570 thousand and a little less, which he rents by downloading PLN 880 a month.
The messenger also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment of PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a proprietary statement.
Voting for interruption at the Conservative Party Conference
The British parliamentary ministers voted against a three-day break in the House meetings for the annual Conservative Party programme conference that the government asked for.
289 Members, v 306.
Usually, the House of the Municipalities does not attend the conferences so that Members do not have to give up on either their participation or the parliamentary meetings.
However, opposition parties considered that at the most crucial time the last weeks before the UK was planned to leave the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the meeting.
There were 289 Members in favour of the government's request for a break, against 306.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The lack of consent for a break may be taken as a political revenge at the Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the Supreme Court has been deemed unlawful and unlawful) and that after the judgment of the judges does not want to apologize for it.
After that judgment, the House of the Municipality has resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s appearance and the following stormy debate.
Johnson rejected the opposition to brexit blocking and avoiding pre-term elections.
“There's time for a brexit.
It must be accomplished to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit needs to come in so that we can deal with the citizens' priorities, the health service, the cost of life.
Brexit must be implemented so that we can unite this country," said Johnson.
The Conference of the Conservative Party is to begin in Manchester on Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
Two major groups of opposition – Labour Party and Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson was given by explaining this long suspension of Parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semical attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish retory of Israeli leaders", writes foreign media.
The President's Ombudsman strongly denyed these reports.
"It's just not true," wrote on Twitter "Blue Spychalski."
Israel’s media, among others, “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, referring to “Jewish Insider,” writes that Andrzej Duda at the meeting with the Jewish Diaspora representatives at the RP Consulate in New York declared that Israel was guilty of the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israel’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Israel Katz, who stated in February that “Poles expelled antisemitism with milk of mothers.”
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of his politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression at the Polish ambassador in Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, a attacker attacked him who screamed, "Pole, Pole."
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," wrote on Twitter "Blue Spychalski."
He underlined that Duda “he never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalsky, the portal “it was invented.”
According to the “JI” speakers, there was also a dispute between the survivor from Holocaust, designated by the Cross of the Commander’s Order of RP, Edward Mosberg, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that the Jews of Israel “the like Israel Kac” are responsible for the increase of anti-Semitism.
According to the Boteach portal, he was supposed to stop Mosberg's statement.
Who is Banas and what did he do?
The building was rented by the pillars that led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's assets statements.
We're summarizing another angle that shocked the government camp.
The TVN Journalists revealed that Marian Banaś, the President of the Supervisory Chamber of Control, had not entered the property statement of a 400-metre stone located in the Kraków Mountain in recent years.
Moreover, his tenant was supposed to run a sex business in this building (and so rent rooms per hour).
In turn, the building has been allegedly since 2016 to cover the repayment of the loan.
The irregularities were noted by Bertold Kittel in the "Supervisier" programme.
The journal revealed that from Banasia the building was rented by people connected to the crime world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes services.
On the charges of Banas, he answered inevitably and maliciously.
Interestingly, the city's basement rented by the building was led to the journalist's discovery of negligence in Banasia's assets statements.
For the stone itself was described in them unclearly, and the income of its rental was to be degraded.
“The majesty of Mariana Banasia and his wives may be worth PLN 6 to PLN 8 million.
In fact, the spouses can commend two homes, three apartments, savings[...], writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia stone itself was worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anticorruption Office currently controls the property statements of Mariana Banasia for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that until she was finished, she would suspend his activities in the NIK. "I'm going to request your marshal's free leave," he assured.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We do not hear that CBA will expand its investigation or speed up the study of Marian Banasia’s assets statements.
That is why we are forced to deliver the authorities of the State and make a notification of the possibility of committing the crime [...]", said Ms Mariusz Witczak.
"If normal Polak had so low valued the rent of his properties, he would have already had 10 controls, taxation, and carnation," he added.
He went high, fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supervisory Board.
The position was set up on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidate was notified by the Law and the Justice and the votes of politicians in this party.
Before that, Banas was bound to the NIK between 1992 and 2005, he acted in this institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008) Banaś became President of the Customs Service and also undersecretary of the State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has re-entered the head of the Customs Service and has been managing the National Treasury Administration since 2017.
For three months, Banas served as Minister of Finance in the Government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master puts a handle on the market for graphic cards
The graphic cards can now weigh a lot, and this is naturally what makes place for the categories of products that would be vain to search on store shelves for a decade ago.
This is the solution – a handle for the ELV8 RGB graphic card – presented by Cooler Master.
The new graphic card handle model is not only a functional solution that allows for a more reliable maintenance of the graphic card without relying solely on PCI-express slot strength.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a police officer's command will be punished
As the paper says, disregarding the order of a certain conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new kind of offence, threatened with fines, arrest or restriction of freedom.
That's what police unionists want to make this change.
The idea went to the Petition Commission's meeting.
"The case is serious, because now, every year, more than half a million criminal cases are going to go to the Polish courts," we read.
"Secpopolita" stated that the petition that the Independent Trade Union police officers writes to Members on the amendment of the Code of offences has a chance to succeed.
The authors of petitions shall propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of offences.
It would say: “Whoever is not subject to the request or command of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the law, is punished by arrest, fine or restriction of freedom.”
"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of the same punishment for those who do not perform command, will prevent or hinder the performance of the service," says the journal.
The Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said, "Rzeczpolitan", that although it agrees with the main message of the provision, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political matters of manifestation.
"In the situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be disadvantaged and instead of mitigating the situation, it would intensify it," adds.
The statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens positively evaluated police interventions in 2018 and that each month the service takes 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jachym Topol writes in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech dramamakers, today exchanged in one row with Václav Havel.
Hence, over Jachym, she has been hanging the curse of talent from the beginning, which she is trying to use.
After eight years, he returned with a "Speakful Man."
The heroes are Buras and Sonia along with two sons, but they do not form a typical Czech family.
They're fishing actors, traveling across Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a single translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys since his birth did not give him a sound, and for the second time he stopped in the infants' days.
But they're not heroes who are the most important in this story.
Everyone is only a background to watch the world where there is no room for artists.
It's the world of an inflamed province, the old society, the suspicious people and the solving youth.
The “Cleasant Man” of places turns into a ridiculous theater.
Narrative imitates the didaskalia, and the talks of heroes create this world.
Europe is full of concerns about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel office Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian philia Neckermann is working.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT TV, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy problems of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with the offices reserved in Belgium will be cancelled, but the holidayers will be able to get the money back.
The court in Gandawa also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12 thousand Belgs are staying abroad on trips purchased by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
Still, on Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now “full operational” despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British mother company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office calmed down that the customers who bought out the trips in it would go for a vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the biggest travel agencies in the world – announced bankruptcy at night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse of the last chance with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors claimed that, in addition to the rescue plan already agreed in August, the company gained an additional £900 million as collateral for the winter period when travel agencies usually have a lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, which resulted in debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for an opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for the opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Action is intended to help combat the progressive decline in the number of citizens of the city.
Görlitz is the most eastern city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel old man attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as the Guardian writes, the city faces major problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also faces a constant decline in the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which shifted into a drop in the city's population by 25%.
In 2013, it was 54,000 people.
To fight with depopulation, the officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
150 proposals have been received as far as the programme is concerned.
Two thirds of them made the inhabitants of large cities.
The programme was also interested in Hungarian, Czech, United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought that the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants in the project.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move on permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the views of the participants in the programme.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what was their motivation," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas for attracting new residents, offering them incentives for accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a payment programme for young people who promised to live and work in the city for a year.
Today such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikyther to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
