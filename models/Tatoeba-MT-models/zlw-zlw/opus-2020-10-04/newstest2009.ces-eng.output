The Prague Exchange has fallen into minus at the end of the trade
After the morning, the Prague storm corrected the losses.
ČEZ transactions have reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague stock exchange has started from the beginning of Tuesday's trading to its Monday's fall when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, it's worth dropping off on Wall Street.
In this way, we also have a market response to the outcome of the vote of the US Chamber of Representatives, which has refused to support the stabilisation plan of that financial sector.
Amount of shares in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday experienced stocks at the exchanges in Asia, although the indexes, during the day, eventually erased the losses.
The Hang Seng stock rate in Hong Kong had almost four percent of its trading, but later some of the losses had deleted and reduced to approximately 2,5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sydney stocks lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The storm in Taiwan according to that index decreased by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the U.S. rescue action is uncertain and it will affect the financial markets throughout the world," said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, the monetary policy is determined separately, i.e. without depending on the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates are Hong Kong at the same level as the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, they're threatened to feel the impacts of other countries.
Blood spa of American shares
The American Chamber of Representatives on Monday rejected the financial system support plan for which up to 700 billion dollars were to be spent (approximately 12 billion CZK).
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy.
The American shares experienced a blood spa on Monday, and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index decreased by almost seven percent and recorded a fall in a similar range last in 1987.
The index has fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the House has not passed, the index has fallen freely.
Congress resigned: The US Government can pump $700 billion into the bank
The U.S. Congress leaders and President's Government George W. Bush agreed to a broader form of a financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
Voting about it will be the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
The Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday at the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, Agent Reuters said that to the President of the Committee on Bank and Financial Services of the House Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to sources, the plan could probably be voted in the first place on Wednesday.
According to the economists, the notification of the approval of the rescue plan should be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of the financial markets.
However, there will be "salvation" thanks to the complexity of mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have solved our different opinions on how it should look like a market stability package," said Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, final vote could take place on Sunday.
The legislators met with the US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definite form of the government fund.
This should be repurchased from financial companies by non-disposed mortgage assets that decompose financial firms into severe losses and jeopardise the stability of the system.
"We are on the verge of a definite agreement on the plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
There is still a need to continue on the healing plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is significantly affected by stock markets that are sharply dropping.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are first in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear that the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, even if they can't put the negotiations on a problem at the last minute.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still have a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the aid of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars are to be available as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
But the Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function in the course of another 100 billion dollars and then the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations
The President may initiate this decision, but Congress may vote in favour.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme was to get finances to buy bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, they are maintained.
"We've worked everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
With progress in the negotiations, American President Bush is also satisfied.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday progress and appreciates the "bou-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies".
Limitation of golden fires
The President of the Senate Bank Committee Christopher Dodd, the head of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed to be responsible for the cash programme, to protect taxpayers from losses, to close the relief, time to finance the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of society participating in the programme and establish a committee that will be supervised by the Fund.
He should run the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards a agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with help for home owners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new payments for the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of payments for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan, according to the main economist, Patria Finance David Mark, is a good idea, very difficult, but it will be realised.
"And that's because they don't know what mechanism and at what cost troubled assets will be bought out.
This will be determined for how the financial sector and the government will share the losses," said iHNed.cz Marek this week.
If the plan is to be approved now or at the beginning of next week, it's not that important to Mark.
"The more important thing is that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important thing at this point," stressed Mark.
Fight on knife blade: MP3 mobile players.
We'll advise you how to choose.
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the way the future owner is used and demanded.
Probably hard to get home to get a high-quality gramophone to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
However, such musical products on LP boards do not come up and, from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason.
If, however, in your shelves, you may dream of such a gramofone at least.
It's the same with the music on the road, i.e. by comprimated music, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also pricing and qualitative categories.
For someone it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for the player, as well as the fan of Pink Floyd will probably be hard to try headphones for 20 crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides battery maintenance
Some top music players can do much more than just playing music, but what most phones don't happen.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
Beside primary functions, phone calls and texts, he can play music and videos, both recordings, he has better, the worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and comms, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photographs anything.
Cell universality also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to charge.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy shafts.
A few phones can play music for more than ten 12 hours, mostly less.
In this direction, music players (specially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, in the cheap phones, count that they won't be playing for more than a few hours.
If you call here and there, get one more charger to work in order to make sure you get one more charger, that also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not each of them can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a few card readers can consult with miniature memory cards used in their mobiles without a reduction.
For players except for exceptions (iPod) you do not need any special software.
Just fill the machine with USB music from the computer.
Most phones and players themselves will already create a music library ranked by the name of the interpreter, name album, genre, or a user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of the directory like the Windows Researcher and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles can do more
When selecting a particular device, you are particularly interested in the maintenance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of the control.
If the music is a backstage for you, and if you listen to it every day just shortly, maybe in a tram, you just need any cell phone that plays MP3.
Which is already capable of almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch what musical formats the mobile or player can do.
MP3 will handle all and the complete majority of music that will reach you will be in this format.
It belongs to the most widespread, and, besides, most instruments can perform music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (form used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow for, for example, online purchase of music.
Just visit the operator's relevant website (or other provider) and the song or the album to buy.
This service could already be a strong argument for acquiring a musical cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and mostly limited to fast-speed radio hits.
Prices are also the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way to sell music (before through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) to the future will be controlled by the music industry.
Most people wear their cell phones all the time.
Whenever you want to hear something, your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always wear headphones or at least wire handsfree with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every phone but only a minimum MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage of musical phones will be for many prizes.
The cheapest is usually below 3,000.
In three and four thousand crowns, you will already have a very decent walkman.
But most of the time, you will be reduced to the lack of output to normal headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped phones, even with a 3,5 mm beard for common headphones, costs up to 15 thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, an easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum functions, the similarity of the control with the earlier normal tape recorder or, for example, the recorder is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an accidental on-line mobile internet and subsequently a giant data transfer account.
By what device to touch
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the right card, you will fit in 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can deal with 8 GBs.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, touch Covon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to more demanding listeners, you prefer to touch specialised mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the service is approaching the separate MP3 player.
The distance is from Sony Ericsson, whose phones from a series of walkman have the same user interface as individually sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery (currently 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take the MP3 players away from the above marks.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, there's something we're missing-- a virtual operator who would have made the classics leverage.
Maybe he won't be long.
About the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
Finally, the CTU confirmed that the price of SMS was higher than the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on roaming charges regulation, there may be a paradoxic situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxic, we have three mobile networks and penetrating over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to play that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has repeatedly expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It's probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably doesn't have a chance anymore (the other way, it'd probably be hard to look for frequency).
But there is one other option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has just led to a significant reduction in prices that the classic operators had to respond to.
At the same time, before the rituals like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices were seen in Great Britain as ours.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Besides, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of a virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In only six months, this operator managed to get over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator.
At the same time, after Mobilking, Penta's financial group, which owns in the Czech Republic, among other things, U:fona.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, they will need much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs of building, operation and maintenance of mobile networks.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low cost - offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a higher service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers a text of at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and a bet on an untreated target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right men choose Mobilking - the operator they like and who they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like Poland could catch even with us.
It doubts the press spokesman Vodafonu Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, in terms of the offer of services, it is relatively saturized."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, they call mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations are not very promising.
It is more likely that Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, Penta's financial group spokesperson in a phone interview.
In fact, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not inclined.
Rather, they're trying to do everything so that no potential competitor can come.
The interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is no longer a group of GTS Nover, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of O2 Telephony in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to progress with some of them," says the press spokesman Paul Kaidl.
So maybe she's flashing for better times.
Unofficial information seems to be the first virtual operator we should be looking forward to by the end of the year.
However, for the time being, the form of it is accompanied by an inevitable wall of silence.
"We do not think at this moment that there is room for a full-value virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been contacted by any subject with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," said in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srszeň from the Telephony O2 Press Department.
Other operators are also appealing to the specificity of the Czech market.
Press spokesperson T-Mobile Martina Kemrová delivers in a rare agreement with the statement O2: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually advantageous business project on which it would be possible to further build."
And he adds, "In the T-Mobil network, there's a virtual operator that's hard to show up by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a specific deal on the table to consider in this short horizon."
Vodafone is rather paying attention to compliance with the requirements of its 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most affordable in terms of our customers.
The main strategy of Vodafon in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible Offices - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to price drops and thus decreases in their profits.
Why, then, make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that if it's something for the operators, they're gonna pull one rope, they're also testifying the tachyards around the U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the CTU was reached at the time of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
They witness this publicly accessible information from the CTU website.
But now U:phone fits as a argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová pointed out: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been empowered by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would put high requirements on it and, above all, on its services."
In view of this, however, the approach of mobile operators is directly impressed by the utter concern of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only the position of the CTU, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the Great Britain and other developed countries - has no power to intervene in competition.
These are exclusively the Competition Protection Office (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical attitude toward the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible after the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure would be concluded.
No such agreement has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," said Christian Chalupa, in response to our question from the OOHS external relations.
I don't think the representatives of the operators will be surprised by such formulated expressions.
From the office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market is more than respected.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the country where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their market entry has contributed to reducing the prices for mobile phone services."
Obviously, pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and price decline are not part of the interests of the OEFS.
Truly shocking the whole case is the touching judgement of three mobile operators, which results from their reaction.
The question is, if it's really just a coincidence, it's offered itself.
Like the exact same price of the gas station at pumping stations, it is certainly just the work of a coincidence and a hard competitive fight.
"The decision in this matter has not found signs of contravention, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so they have an adequate increased responsibility for their market negotiations.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunication regulator," said Chalupa.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many disputed points.
Obviously, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications are the only market in terms of competition.
In this market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - to create a virtual operator, the consent of the network operator is always needed.
And the mobile operator-- he's got quite logical -- on his network of monopoly.
So in a particular segment, it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least warning that three mobile operators are going very similarly.
The complaints of a number of interested parties (including the GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The mission of responsibility to the CTU is then in the telecommunications a relatively common trick that the UOHS puts hands away from the whole matter.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, to the recent amendment of the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the ČTÚ's competence in the field of competition in telecommunications has failed to sell, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
That's what representatives of the UOHS need to know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's good when no one's looking.
However, without notice, there are some pseudovirtual operators that exist in the Czech mobile networks immediately.
These are companies that issue their own mobile telephone prices, which are only partly public.
It is usually a multilevel marketing company.
It also offers Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
These companies usually get only to the chosen ones.
The spell is that the company is acting as a classic corporate customer that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trade conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibited by a similar sale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would deal with and could result in the conclusion of cooperation with that company," she answered our question to this issue by Martin Kemr.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity to the responsible mobile operators would not be carried out.
In particular, in the case of three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be.
None of the operators are defending such a procedure.
Since the activities of these companies have unnecessary profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický notes the possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies only use the negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not led to their name, so they cannot have it fully as regular mobile operators' customers."
This is exactly what the CTU should be at least strange.
In addition, another question is being opened for the UOHS.
If mobile operators keep an eye close to a similar procedure, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to say that the EIOHS has similar activities to reveal relatively strong powers, and if he doesn't want to, they may not be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea of anything like this and their business conditions prohibit that.
When we're not the most expensive
As the text has already fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in prices for services.
However, virtually in all countries where virtual operators were created, classic operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Jimi used arguments were practically identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In advanced countries, but in these moments, regulatory authorities have intervened, which have defended the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether the formal measures or the informal pressure were then achieved by the first virtual operator and the other one was packed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing their entire case as a hot potato.
We can't get rid of our experiences of the impression that incompetence is more than useful in these cases.
But let's not throw flint into the rye.
If the backstage information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has admitted a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult to remain indispensable to reject (discriminatory) other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the drain before the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four versions of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the state hymns on the occasion of the Czech State Day.
Hymna has recently recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions - with male or female salt sings, in congregation submission and instrumental text.
The song was taken by Kateřina Kněžnice and Adam Plachetka.
Authors of anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The babysitter considers the Czech National Song as one of the most beautiful hymens.
He already said to the Czech Radio that he deliberately chose to sing salt variants of singers with young representative voices that are marked and popular.
"I have tried to take care of the congregation from the beginning of the two, and then I have tried to make sure that they have a clear dictatorship to understand the text well to judge," he said.
The Czech State Anthem will celebrate 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Stavov Theatre in the original Czech game Fedařka Josef Kajetan Tyl, supplemented by the music of Františka Škroupa.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously took her to theirs.
After the creation of the Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first slope of the song became a natural part of the state anthem.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
How does "new" anthem sound?
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time ride and chip
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, it will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date of the first passengers in the pocket of an electronic coupon in the metro, tram and buses.
He can get about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card at this point.
Travelers can buy 30 days and 90 days and annual coupon (it will be paid from 1 January 2009) at the same time to record their chip card in infocentres and workplaces Transportation firm in the Museum Metro stations, Bridges, Trains Holešovice, Angel, Stretch, Letňany, Kobylisy, Paradise Garden, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased also from yesterday via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who will start using the internet business can ultimately forget the expedition window at the metro stations, where they had to stand regularly on long fronts on paper tickets.
The coupon is going to buy it through the Internet, and they'll record it in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, a passenger is available with a skilled service, which will help interested people with the online purchase and also upload their card purchased coupon," said the spokesman Martin Ostražný.
Aside from the library, electronic coupons on Opencard will also be available in self-service machines that are installed in several metro vests.
How do machines like that look?
They are red, reminded of ticket markers, and passengers may have noticed them in the stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year they should be 80," he added Careful.
Coupon will check the seat of the driver the automate
The machine service that starts working tomorrow is simple.
All you need to do is move the Opencard chip card into them, and the previously paid coupon will record it himself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow pay not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In suburban trains and bus lines with numbers of 300 to 499, which go to the capital, mainly residents of the Central Bohemian Municipalities.
"In the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, whereby they detect the time and band validity of the coupons," explained the check of the tickets Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles the schedules of Prague public transport.
The city buses have card readers built in a cabinet near the driver.
It is therefore necessary to show the driver not only the chip card, but it is also necessary to add Opencard to the designated post on the side of the checkout.
The driver will check the validity of the coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the coupons, there is nothing easier to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Travelers who don't drive suburban buses and won't remember when their coupon expires, can go back to self-service machines where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here the information on the validity of their documents shall be displayed on the display of the apparatus.
The Sudets wanted a referendum for the U.S.
The Sudet Germans in 1945 requested the integration of Shumava to the United States.
It will flow from the letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the patronage of the United States of America.
Some groups of Sudet Germans returned to the U.S. President with such wish in 1945.
It flows, among other things, from a letter that was preserved in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from the Czech Krumlov demand in the letter of the American President not to allow the return of the "shumavian frog" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the monks' agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the right situation and we want to be truly sure that the American forces come in the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," writes in the letter, signed by the word "The people whose fate lies in the heart."
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia is allegedly giving the Sudet Germans - with the knowledge of Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, carelessness, misunderstanding, anxiety and slavery, asks the authors of the letter of the American President to take over Shumava to take over the protection for the present and everlasting times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state, who oppresses and disbelieves minorities and nothing, has contributed to the victory of the Allies," writes in a letter.
The reason the authors can't sign, it's supposedly a fear of the vengeance of the Czech oppressors.
If the president of the USA allegedly doubted the idea of smuggling Germans, it was enough to organize a referendum on whether its residents wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of postwar history, according to some of the memorials it is appropriate to draw the early expectations of the Sudet Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that it would be their removal from the Republic, only few of them had such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a certain type of autonomy to the Sudets.
Others believed they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Budějovice.
He was like a wake-up German planted to the Navy in Balt during the war.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holsten, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would be useful," the Chalupa said.
None of the German captives living in front of the war in Czechoslovakia, he believes that he would be removed from the Republic on the basis of Beneš's decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotive campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
Still, it would be possible to characterise an emotional media campaign that will start the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
The Office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to dispose of the driver from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
A 150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, and on the flyers.
The driver should be distracted from fast driving and alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them, that they may be afflicted before they leave.
He wants to touch the conscience especially young drivers, bikers, walkers, and, last but not least, also professional drivers.
And what happens in spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And there's also a "blooding" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is written by big letters on the espresso.
And in the pool of blood, the word is "pay."
This is supposed to symbolize that a person can pay his own life in a moment of innocence.
The viewers will scare the spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglosaic countries, where it is commonly possible to see images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He promises that this will reduce accident and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
Spoty was prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The system of sugar and whips pays for the driver.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to red, it saves time.
Bič is a threat to penance or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital at Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why we need information campaigns in the press and mostly negative advertising, he's a psychologist.
According to him, there are already less effective boards that remind the drivers of the danger.
"If a static table warning against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it," the Kořan warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The presidency of the Ehud Olmert provisional government was pronounced for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the prejordanians, the eastern Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did this in a conversation that was printed by the Jediot Achronot diary on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with Palestinians, which means it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories if not all at all," said Olmert journal.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to proceed to Palestinians a similar percentage (the territory of Israel), because he will not be peace without it," he added.
He admitted that even eastern Jerusalem will include any return.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want the tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up the parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert in the insurgency of two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of persons were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places" which lies inside the Old City.
"The one who wants to keep Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," emphasised.
Departure from Golan Heights
Olmert also pronounced the exit of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an irresponsible condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I do not suggest peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's departure," he warned.
"The Syrian people know what they're gonna have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hizballah (Sheitian Movement); they will have to give up permanent support to terrorism (Sheitian Movement) Hamas, (terrorist networks) Al-Qaida and Jihad (Sacred War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after accident: Are stevardi on the bus illegal?
The law is not known, walking on a remote bus must not be
With regard to the tragic accident of the bus by Student Agency near the Italian Padov, the question was whether stevardi and bus passengers could travel on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the operation of the stewarda is contrary to the road traffic law," says the spokesman of the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka.
An accident that died last week of the twenty-year-old stallion, apparently caused a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the least safe place in the car, although it had two other places reserved.
However, the bus can crash or stop sharply, even when the stevard delivers coffee or newspapers.
Roli plays whether the bus according to the technical license is equipped with places to stand.
If the bus is not approved, the passengers must sit.
Remote buses Student Agency have no station seats; which has also been confirmed by the Director of Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I have dealt with, and at the beginning, the passenger movements have not been allowed.
Afterwards, they called it off, and we concluded that passengers may go to the bathroom for driving, if they have their seats," he said his opinion.
He doesn't know the law of the stevarda
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stevarda - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation is prohibited by the carriers to provide services.
The Law on Road Transport only knows the date of the driver of the vehicle; his rights and obligations do not define," says the less clearly spokesman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the Head of the Road Traffic Department Josef Pokorný believes that the law is treated sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed to stand in approval.
This ends," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where there are stations and limited maximum speeds, inter-towns with stations with higher speed and distances without stations with maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, the expert says
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Hořín in the movement of statards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"On a smooth ride, many dangers do not endanger, the situation can be compared to the service on planes.
It's not even certain when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can fit into the head."
"But if the bus would be incredibly disturbed, of course, physical laws apply.
Just like the city bus or the tramway.
The security of the statards must deal with the internal rules of the carrier," says, and also says, in terms of law, the issue is not solved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers stvard services as the only bus carrier.
He's employing hundreds of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their occupation to be risky.
"But as soon as I think it's a risk job, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers on board.
It would save the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who operates a fraction of lines compared to SA, just just justified the absence of stevards in his cars.
"We don't have stents, we've been up against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with a fatal injury," said Týden.cz.
A terrible tragedy has happened
In the accident of the link connection to Naples, a young stew from Pilsenska was killed, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off without using the direction from the strip and blocked the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but he seized the right front part of it.
That there would be two seats reserved for the rest of the hundreds, Janchura refuses.
"This place is not possible at remote connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's orchard, but the financial compensation is expected by the guilty man.
Law adjustment?
I won't.
The clarification of the movement of statards on board the bus could bring a regulation for which a 30-year expert group of transport services is working on.
"But there was no concrete conclusion.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile while driving," says the expert burner.
"Ministership of transport does not consider the operation of stevards as something that would essentially jeopardise the safety of passengers," concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the Labour Security Offices.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The great words in the letter of the WestLB board to the employees of this bank.
With the unit of this Düsseldorf cash institution with the Frankfurt Deca-Bank, the "central financial group institutions will be funded for trade in equity markets," we will read in the letter that came to the public on Monday.
The WestLB, in accordance with the letter in this transaction, will bring "competence" to ensure long-term returns.
And he said that such a connection could be a crucial impulse to further associations in the land bank sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in difficult times.
The unstable WestLB is still under a significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Land Government in North Porýní-Vestphalia is still fresh in time to find a solution for the future.
However, the link between Deka-Bank, which the savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever kind of connection, is spoken for a long time - even on the French side.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waaas, when presenting the six-year management results at the end of August, heard that in the merger of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the land banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Governing Board of Deka-Bank, which is behind one half of the Land Bank and the second association of the spořitelen, has entrusted the board with the Governance of Interviews with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be trades in or part of the capital market.
However, the talks have just begun, the financial players are touching.
The Deca-Bank, which belongs to the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak for the first time in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that Deka-Bank and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba could be merger.
There was nothing out of this tripartite.
Shortly after the merger plans got public, the Hebrew Land Government expressed itself against the participation of Helaba.
Both of the remaining banking houses didn't connect that way.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz received Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
However, speculation about the connection of Deka-Bank with the earthly banks has been repeated.
However, recent speculation on the connection of his financial home with others was expressed negatively by Günther Merl, President of the Board of Directors of Helaba.
However, it seems that independently, it shows the belief that the revolving of the various banking homes of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Bavaria, it would be the first to start raging the BayernLB connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on the next merger is to grow, it is gradually losing possible partners for such connections.
Only the second violin would play in the south, even though the financial crisis has so far faced significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Once again, the association with WestLB forbids the Association of Savings and the giro banks of Hessen-Thüringen, who has a share of 50% in Helaba.
That would be the highest Nord LB.
The geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much business models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question of the business model should be ensured by future competitiveness of the Earth banks, the German association of savings and grey banks has not yet been answered.
All could also end with the WestLB distribution that no one wants in this institution, of course.
That is why in the letter of the board there is also talking about trying to "comprehensive solutions" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual ingredients to the Deka-Bank, will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "víkend with Italy"
It's for Elena for the first time, for Luc's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and he says everything's gonna be different, he says.
Behind them, in the five-litter barrel of Kaiser, there is a stronger beard and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest proves how deep tones can deliver his throat.
Elena Luca's gonna pee first, and then she'll kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking area next to the Puorta Nuova station, will go out this evening at 23.45 four buses with the name "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses operate mainly Italians, only Brazilians are on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans sing with their flag, they celebrated at night.
And that's what Marco Guarda says out loud, it's not for Italy.
Marcove, who wears a long coat with a necklace made of leather and glasses with wide silver rings, these three buses belong.
He's been driving to Oktoberfest for five years. He's only hosting three trips this year.
In the night there, over the day between the beer stands, at 22.30 leaving back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The road costs EUR 75, including the welcome toast by Kaiser, prepared exactly according to the Bavarian Law on Purity of Beer, Health Insurance and German Speaker Guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses drive up to the night, after the autostrade heading to Brennero.
Beer is not given, not yet.
Bus shuts down fast, passengers sleep.
They're doing well, they're gonna need their powers.
It will be in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway 8 a bit before Munich makes another break and a lot of other buses with the Italian license plate.
When the Marcova group finally arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwies, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has the last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, put on a yellow cap.
On it is written "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to Marco's website: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the door opens into the beer tent, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and settle your seats in the back of the tent.
"Don't move forward, not all the yellow hats on the same bench, place yourself in space!"
The maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget tips.
"Get the surgeons to show us we're being polite.
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!"
Three: "Tonight at exactly eleven p.m., be back here!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as marks on trees, signs and even on the election poster of one large bavorian side.
We need to prepare for retreat.
Like "Vikend with Italy" is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
The exact details of the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about 50,000 people traveling through the Alps and falling into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this weekend.
Many monks police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavaria Red Cross, which leads national statistics, in which Italians in front of the British (approximately 60 interventions) and Racushans (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments take their first place.
The Hofbräu tent is particularly popular at the Italians.
No sleepless nights for creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück pointed out that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatative" and in its claim the fact that the German banking sector will not remain spared of crisis developments.
For the one that came up last weekend.
In the index of Dax, the monitored financial house specialising in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is given a loan of several billion to protect from turbulence in the markets from the German bank consortium.
The person familiar with the situation on Monday told the Reuters Agency that the credit aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only on the actual amount exhausted.
They say money comes from private and public banks.
In the background, Depfa's subsidiary is lost.
According to the report on the long-term projects for which he borrowed money, this state financial entity has refinanced extremely short-termly, which is no longer possible because of disbelief in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank reserve was recovered by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity from 1.6 to 1.45 % slightly decreased.
Current returns and net returns from financial corporations compared to the last year decreased to zero, revenues from increased value of claims and certain securities, as well as the abolition of credit trading reserves, decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher returns on the subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and on the reimbursement of interest under the tax order and for the brokering of trade for companies, the 16% decline on the benefit side was still diminished.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former State Finance burned down on mortgages for business operators, which were then distributed from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since it was too low in classic state funding, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate has to write something down and these depreciations will have a "relevant material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have made it indefinitely heard.
The fact is, the dividend won't be.
For 2007, it was shortened by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is a major financial player of state and infrastructure projects since Depfa has been taken.
More strongly than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the American Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers virtually dried the spring between bank loans two weeks ago, because the banks are guarding liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of Depfa's credit portfolio - about €50 billion - short-term refinancing funds.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan for the foreseeable period and the company is protected "before the influence of international cash markets currently in a significant degree of incapacity".
Other resources have been heard that refinancing has been provided by these money by the end of 2009.
The chairman of HRE Georg Funke, on the contrary, declared that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the cash markets at the earliest time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Service Supervisory (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
That's what shareholders and bank creditors hope to do.
But with regard to dynamics and inconsistencies of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank stood before the insolation on Sunday afternoon, apparently, he can't, however, presume, salvation of passion.
The stock rate fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the courses of bonds were well held.
While the priority debts have virtually failed to move, the secondary bond rates are losing significantly.
This mainly concerns the bonds of the former subsidiaries of Württemberg Hypo and logical bonds with the period of maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate’s obligations originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is needed after a significant increase in the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which took it into the company by taking Depfa, to understand depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the emission banks, governments and less affected trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the repayment of securities within their maturity period.
But it may also happen in what almost no longer dare to hope – in the next 15 months the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, in view of the reports coming in parallel with this partial stamp, there has now become only legitimate hope, from the likelihood of the confidentiality.
This will probably prepare a number of awakening nights especially for long-term creditors to decide whether to give up their commitments.
The short-term investors may at least use the margin line to create a transfer of losses from the previous financial year to the incomes of the following years for the purpose of future payment of the capital income tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the Bento box
When she's 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop's first day of high school in Tachibana, she's gonna start to grab a girl: this German is a "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mango.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been chased out of my way to school.
I live on Tokia's side towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by high school train in Tachibana.
I had to find the path myself, fortunately, I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the Tachibana teaching is not given as strictly as our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eighth hour and twenty minutes ago, a short sitting with a teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before the class started, I should've introduced myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've taken an old dress on my host mom, to that blouse, blue underwear, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything right: 'Saiónara Wosh Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and I'm on my birthday in a week.
At that point, I was so glad I started to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class fucked up, chichotalo and whipped, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed to survive and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I quickly went to my place.
She smiled pretty widely next to me, she thought it was an honor that she was supposed to sit next to her to a foreign student.
The rest of the clock was quite calm, but when the gong called, I literally fell asleep.
They spoke over the other side and chichotaly and asked me about possible and impossible, while it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the time, they all unpacked their bents.
My host mom also made me a box of lunch, and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some kind of fish in a tofu pastry.
I don't usually know exactly what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste pretty new.
The fact is, everything's really good.
Well, except for the salt loaded mushrooms, bro!
Benta at Japanese school isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a properly prepared bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes that a boy knows a little closer during a snack.
I read about that in my manga comic books.
I'm wondering if I'll see it here, too.
'Why was Japan asking me my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.
After all, I've enjoyed reading the mango for years.
And to understand these comics and their cultures better, I started to learn Japanese once a little bit.
So I was perfectly clear that I would have to come here one day.
Because I have a weakness for tradition, habits and habits.
And they're high-valued.
On the one hand, Japan is the countries of the latest technologies and trends, on the other is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach runs from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurolog Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how could it be possible to verify that they feel the same when they act like us?
The "Edge" Internet magazine has been publishing the contributions of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his show represents the selected answers to the question, "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conditions of consciousness without being able to prove it to me or anyone else so far if we cannot prove even that consciousness has other people.
But in this case, we can at least hope because all human brains have a suitable basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to focus on another species and open questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter an incredibly terrain, because hardware does not match.
If a rat gets into danger, he'll do the same thing as many other animals: he'll pretend to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People act similarly, which some scientists judge for comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe in it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it easier to transfer our subjective experience to animal experience.
It is, however, because circuits connected to human consciousness almost always include a side prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performing or managing functions).
This extensive area is significantly more developed for humans than for other primates, and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to believe that one is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic oddness could hide the language of man: because it is so much part of his perception connected with the language, it is often said that knowledge depends on it.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness hadn't mattered in the language, he would certainly have influenced the tongue, so the animal consciousness, whatever it is, would probably be different from most of our consciousness.
That's why it's hard to figure out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something inner and subjective, he can't even measure, because of a special hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, he's building us his investigation against great problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness, which should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine animal consciousness, regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, dedicated to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is focused on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of imfrontal cortex for visualisation.
What does this mean for feelings?
I'm making them out that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we call "strach" is a mental state in which we are located when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reaction) uses operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to the areas of cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with linguistic nature, gentle degradation of perception arises, because by means of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize the states to assign them to others next to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain tribe devoted to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain strain.
Since this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could be able to participate in the feelings perceived by many animal families.
I can't quite theoretically oppose it, but I consider it impossible.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us in rats and people as fear is likely to feel both organisms the same: But how can it be verified, says Pankseep, whether the rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach runs from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, similar behavior cannot prove the dignity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison will move us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, the cockroaches and the brain.
But is he responsible for feelings of the brain tribe?
And even if it was possible to prove it in a person, how would we like to prove it to a rat?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness lies on special circuits and on the tongue), I prefer to examine emotions than the emotional perception of the rat.
Anyway, in this case, we can look forward to progress at the neuronal level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not examine the language and consciousness, I do not examine feelings, I do not know if they exist.
It's possible to consider it short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than recurring against the walls.
I'm a practical emotionist.
President UEFA Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be guided directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize ME together with Poland," said Vasjunyk.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is a lot to do in both countries."
In early implementation of the timetable of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports both the hosts scatter.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must work as quickly as possible now," said Grigorij Surkis.
"EUFA will follow us all the time."
A more radical step has been agreed in Poland.
The management of the Polish Union of PZPN was revoked after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister for Sport Mirosław Drzewiecký.
They say there is "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said the Polish press agency PAP.
"The president of UEFA Michel Platini by letter made sure that this step will not last the preparation for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to the forced retreat in the last season because of the manipulation, eventually it had to be moved on quickly.
Scattered Dennis Quaid returns a blow
She wanted to make a commercial for a new film, talk about private things - and now she's got problems with her ex-girlfriend: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a divorcer.
He's furious, and he's blowing back.
The late war of roses in the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaida: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors have been having a pretty good dispute in front of the public.
Meg Ryan first expressed herself in an interview for the American magazine InStyle for the reasons of her marriage: "Dennis has been infidel for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she knew about the scale of fraud after the divorce.
For this mental striptizer, it was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - that tells the story of a twisted marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: "It's crazy," said the four-week actor of the New York Daily News, that "Meg repeatedly resurrects the history of our relationship and adjusts it".
In addition, it's "political," that to a common 16-year-old son Jack again "recognizes pain and radical changes for each child's divorce."
While Ryan lives alone from her divorce, Quaid's married again, and recently he became the father of twins.
It concludes with its thoughts about shying like this: "My life goes on anyway.
I find myself happy to have an amazing family that is doing great."
Prices of flights and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, the years according to one current study were even cheaper than 50 percent.
Flights and accommodations in hotels have levied again - this is the result of the study of the travel and financial service provider of American Express.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made from the first half of 2008 and, after the increase in prices in the first quarter, it found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years, prices in the hotel market have increased, accommodation in many places has already been levied.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of 48 European cities still on average by 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most apparent trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay by 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express considers this trend a weak dollar course that caused the "decreasing taste of American tourists to travel".
The prices of hotels were also more affected by financial centres than industrial centres such as Hannover, Kolín above Rhine or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent even a European record.
In the first quarter, the airline prices also reported an increase in trend:
Because of the health of the kerosine, passengers in the Economy class had to pay by 7.1 percent more on average than in 2007, even 29.2 percent of the fuel was recovered from the demanding long-distance flights.
From April to June, prices of airline in the Economy class decreased by an average of 12,5 percent compared to the previous quarter, however, in Business and First-Class were less significant changes in knowledge.
In Germany prices declined even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 percent have risen, and the second quarter decreased by 23.6 percent.
In the German national years, even half of the prices decreased according to the quoted study.
One reason for this price drop is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure because of the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised the air traffic between the US and Europe.
The significance of the tense situation is the disturbance of unnecessary air carriers, as well as the high number of airline companies that declared a competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airline companies.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one gate and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the forehead of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to build a working eleven.
He wrote Kristoffer Klein - expanding the unscheduled landing for Marko Marina's representative.
This player from Gladbach has joined the game too late and failed to hit the balloon on the bar.
His report was precisely formulated and sounded convincing from his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the bureau arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break between the mid-times and most people were sitting in their places.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapy for almost three decades and has been taking greater respect than many momental actors.
So his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Coach's assistant Cornelius Jol approached and picked up a thumb on the sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Chief Coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order was probably similar: I'm with the other goal!
It didn't happen.
"It didn't look nice here today," admitted later, Marcell Jansen.
I Bastian Reinhardt would've done it "willing to be more relaxed."
After 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgans owe Mladen Petriće head (11.) and the circumstances that very weak Gladbasans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of his existence this Monday.
So on Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the lively updated table on the videospot in which their team was presented as a prime minister.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He believes that the ongoing table result symbolizes rather incomprehensibility of the league than the domination of its HSV.
The team with late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silva, goalkeepers Petriće and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but can't shine yet.
"We need more feelings and more dribling," Jol strongly said.
After defeating the vote
There's fear spread on Wall Street.
The first reports on the sinking of the rescue package caused a decrease in the Dow Jones index to 700 points.
That was the biggest score loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow took something back.
Around 20.30, this most important world exchange barometer showed a 5% decline to 10 579 units.
The technology storm Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in a minus at 1548 points.
The worst part was in Dowa at this moment, American Express, who lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' shares have lost nearly ten percent.
A few days ago, the large-investor Warren Buffett had a share in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgages are to be available.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at once but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive the stock options of the financial companies which could be paid in favour of the development of the course, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Acce courses in Europe strumes fall
Miliard aid to banks in Europe and the US does not dispose of investors.
The course of shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly destupable and downloads the index of Dax.

Dax clearly slipped under a psychologically important line of 6,000 points and with a negative of 3,7 percent recorded 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, he started a business day on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors are afraid that the US government rescue package worth $700 billion would not be sufficient to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3,3 percent during the first hour of business, and it is at 10,809,25 points.
The US Chamber of Representatives has to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could express himself on October 1st.
Other European stock exchanges were taken only one direction: in London the FTSE index was first weakened by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.

Dark Mass affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists haven't known advice with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitation practition).
Experts are afraid that the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein would not have to be entirely right.
Almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the universe.
By the blame of fuel lines that will soon freeze, it will now be threatened by death in the winter.
One mysterious phenomenon has been a mess among scientists for years - an anomaly of gravity.
The gravitational practise is the airmanevre of the space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some space body, such as Earth.
The probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case in admiration: the flying bodies do not seem to be 100% as expected by the old good gravity law.
On the contrary, it occurs iniquity at speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physics have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of the gravitational dust.
Several experts fear that even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of the material by curing the space, would not have been entirely right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the anomalies of the gravity practise using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomaly could be a dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," writes.
The existence of dark matter has been known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is evidently gravitational force, whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
She alone is completely invisible, which means she doesn't send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just or visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, five of the total mass of the universe is good of this dark matter.
In Egypt, hijacking tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs in Egypt is again abducted by tourists on the loose.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
He said six kidnappers were killed in a shootout before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom negotiations are already running.
The Germans repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists are apparently free to enter the Sahara.
They reported it consistently by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station of Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Franco Frattini, according to the reports of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're just verifying their health condition," said Frattini.
According to the Egyptian State TV report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, and eight Egyptian guides are safe and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert seem to be on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting remains unclear before the hostage release: according to the expression of the Egyptian security worker, the kidnappers were ready to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been resolved.
They agreed to the ransom," quoted by a quoted worker.
He said, "it was just about taking over the hostage," when suddenly "the surprise came."
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked for a ransom of €6 million in Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" with appeal to one of the German brokers said that the release of the hostages stretches because the kidnappers are worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
Men should have been kept until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by father's "it led to suicide"
Several-year-old abuses led a woman to kill herself, sounded before trial.
After he confessed to eight cases of sexual harassment, Michael Trerise of Stithians was sentenced to six years.
The Coronary Court in Truro heard that his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle was bound regularly when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," wrote Treris in confession.
In court, it was also said that Miss Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007 at 34 years of age.
When she lived in Coventra as a child, Trerise tied her eyes together and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, it was said that Miss Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was chasing a vision of abuse that was committed twice a week.
The complainant Ramsey Quaife said that in 2006, Miss Randle's friends said that she was also very dedicated to surfing and cycling that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "resolutely gave up life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
They think she suffocated with an gelite bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather's face, who wrote a confession ended up saying, "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends by taking the victim's life.
It's even worse that if she hadn't done that, the thing would probably not have gotten to court at all."
"Specially, I would like to emphasise the consequences your crime on their daughters according to Stephanie's parents in those years," he added.
"Of course, she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be accused of
The BBC found out that the government official who left strictly secret documents on the train in June will be accused under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two strictly secret documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents got in the hands of the BBC before the police were handed.
It is the least serious offence against the law, and nothing suggests a crime.
The BBC writer Frank Gardner said that such a move will be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was dealing internally between the Ministry and the Government's Office," he said.
A staff member who must not be appointed shall be accused in accordance with Section 8.1 of the Act concerned, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Corunian prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan police to prosecute the official on the basis of a very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Rapporteur Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents that he forgot included secret analysis of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Cooperative bases face B&B debt
The British cooperative bases may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds after saving the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley £14 billion to protect deposits.
Interest of this loan will pay all companies that receive client deposits, including 59 cooperative bases.
The Director-General of the Association of Cooperative Funds (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "professional" that the foundations and their members must pay.
The 14-milliard debt will eventually be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, in the meantime, the interest to be paid annually to all 700 financial companies receiving client deposits will be paid.
The Fund of the Compensation Plan for Cash Services for BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative bases are counted in this figure.
It's humiliating that these institutions that have behaved carefully... now have to pay some accounts of those institutions that have not been so thoughtful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits she held, and that the deposits should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that debt interest will rise to £ 450 million in 2009.
That means the backups will have to find 81 million pounds to pay off the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Cooperative Association, told BBC that it was convinced that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have been treated considerably during the riot market must now pay some accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerable."
According to BSA, no backing since 1945, when they appeared, it hasn't fallen.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter in the next few weeks to see what the possibilities of protecting the cooperative bases and their members from the account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid throughout the year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since the cooperative foundations are a shareholder organisation without shareholders, this account will ultimately pay their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk health by five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pens per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after two-pencary health in February, and comes after research carried out by a consultancy company.
The retailers have to decide themselves if they want to reflect health at customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey changed last in 2002.
Cash for the Bangladesh expremier denied
The Bangladesh Court rejected the request by the former Prime Minister of Shah Hashina Vadjid for release on bail, which means that if he returns to the country, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to bail her in connection with the accusation that she had acquired the extortion from a certain businessman over 50 million (729 700 dollars) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several charges for corruption that are raised against it.
Chálida Zijá, a long-term political rival of Šajch Hasin, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheich Hasinna is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked her to give her the local government held first full freedom.
The writers say that while she was released to the honorary word to be able to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear under the conditions of her release if she stays free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say they are now appealing against the rules of the Chief Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court.
"The prime court rejected the request of the Shaich Hasin for bail with the fact that he did not need bail when he has already undergone an examination for an honorary declaration abroad," said her attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the orders of the Chief Court."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for December's elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Šajch Hasína should return home after October 17th.
She was arrested last year after the military held by the interim government took over power, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Shaych Hasin and Chálid Zijá both reject all the charges raised against each other.
Fear of Vaccination against Defence in Afghanistan
According to the UN, almost 200,000 children were not attended by recent plural vaccination against defence because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations was vaccination last week in six provinces.
However, she says that for security reasons she could not get to the children in the south in Helmanda and Kandahar.
The UN spokesman said that despite the Taliban promises, it would not be attacking or defending thousands of vaccination workers at work.
BSkyB lost a trial on ITV
BSkyB lost a judicial dispute on the review of the Commission's competition decision, which led the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting company ITV.
The Appellate Tribunal for the Competition of BSkyB indicated that it would reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission has previously declared that BSkyB’s share was a competitive fight and gave companies an indirect influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased a share in 2006 in a trade that, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV bought.
In April 2007, the Office for Fair Trade announced that the acquisition of a share in ITV of BSkyB had given rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission for competition to initiate an investigation.
Chief of Consortia Virgin Sir Richard Branson, Consumer Organization and Officer Ofcom were all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was incomprehensible and as a disproportionate solution - especially because BSkyB previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigation of the American Advocates' affairs
The U.S. Attorney appointed a special prosecutor to examine the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The Tah came in a situation where the report on the aphere drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislator and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the concerns that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now be investigating whether the officers interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators with a view to pursuing justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious command, including potential crime, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The Spor began when the U.S. Ministry of Justice disposed of nine American attorneys in December 2006.
That's when the Ministry said that the lawyers were released for weak performance.
However, later, it turns out that the release of lawyers was not assessed by much worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to the conclusion that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting highly built Republican Members and Senators, others refused to investigate the charges of deceiving voters against the Democrats.
The U.S. attorneys are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
Earlier head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got fired for release and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report of the Inspector-General expressed itself very critical to the role of Gonzales in the aerial, saying that he carried "main responsibility" for the release that he "absdicated" from his leadership and "not "supervisedly involved".
Other officials, including former high Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's leader will be appreciated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards Prizes for his epical anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who comes to London's ceremony next weekend for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" by recognition.
A song that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title song of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
This year's nomination leads the Coldplay group, which entered the closest selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of Magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals that Meat Loaf provided.
It started the instrumental parts that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held around nine years in the ladder and sold more than 40 million copies around the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was also operated because of an irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, the acute laryngitid made him cancel concerts.
Later, it turns out he had a cyst on his loudspeakers.
Competitive streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other ground communications, some famous, other only useful ones.
But even many cab drivers-veterans and long-term locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of him.
This little street is in the East Village district and leads north of the First Street - without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic.
There's no sign of street names.
It's virtually invisible in the normal atlas.
Yet, there is a bounty of admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
Extra Place wants to refill and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques that are to be opened in the new buildings.
The other admirers are the neighbors for years who say they were a shorted alley of charming just because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was deprived.
However, the City Protection and Development Office, which has the street in its power, is not the least interested in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the Municipal Community, the representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay were reviewed by the plan that the developer of the street should buy.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers such a variant where the streets stay in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be given next month.
"The town already owns only very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in his possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to retreat the small street and settle the seats, of which several would use a cafe, whose interest in renting the space developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, he does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of the Avalon Bay is to repair this wasteland alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale suggested the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Office for the Conservation of the Construction, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office is to develop property rather than manage.
Compared to his colorier neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a stain in history.
Some people think that the streets got their name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's big farm was divided between several of his children and the narrow stripes of the country had no claim.
The extra Place led the back door of the CBGB, the punkic memorial, which closed in 2006, and the street may be the most famous as the background of the photograph on the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who took a picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, broken clothes, and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some of the local, including bloggers who write about rebuilding the East Village neighborhood, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that that a piece of public property, although well, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarith - almost unchanged piece of town, which should be left just as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes the blog named Jeremiah's disappearing New York (with the subtitle of "The Book of Screams: the mustard nostalgic view of the city in the demissing process), posted a part of the story about Extra Place from the Rubrika Talk about the city that appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even in the day, and bordered by the rusty iron gates of warehouses and stirred windows, where the old newspapers are running for a week."
Except for a few exceptions, the alley of one last night looked exactly the same.
The rat passed through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where today is a expensive clothing shop.
There was graffiti on the wall, and next to the fresh deliveries of thrown newspapers, there was an empty bottle of beer.
A few of the survivors said that they don't think about Extra Place anytime, but it suggested that he could use some riot.
On the other hand, Fields said that some people think that they underestimate the effect of the alley in its current condition.
"Best years of my life," he said, "they were in the dark, wet and disgusting places."
Decree on bilaterality: immersion in English
In this edition, focused on education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, academic worker from California and the Director of Education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Horder than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools".
Efficiently addressing hispian voters is a tricky thing.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign states that "Afro-American and Spanish students have significantly lower probability that they are sufficient than white pupils," which is true.
In order to fight such performance differences, Obama’s educational agenda promotes, especially, among other things, the "transitional double-lingual education" for those who are currently learning English.
The question of Barack Obama, however, remains if his commitment to bilateral education, which emphasises the use of languages other than English in class, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let's take the Sixth Street Prep, the Charter Base School in Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are in total most of the Hispanic cases of low-private families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only arrived recently, are just learning English.
Yet, in the 2008 state mathematics tests, the highest level of incredible 100 percent of pupils of fourth grades was reached.
Almost equally amazing ninety-three percent of pupils of fourth grades have reached the highest level in state tests from English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by another method that Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and training, constant assessment of skills and access without excuses.
Further, and that Obama should notice, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the teaching approach of school for those who are just learning English, "full immersion".
The immersion in English stresses the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me, "We had a great success with one completely new student from Mexico-- after 12 months, you would enter the class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep for a pattern, what should other schools with large share of hispanic and English learning pupils look like?
The results that the school is reaching should, from the answer to this question, make it clear, but the educational agenda of its own Party (National Education Association is a long-term advocate for double-lingual education) and its own consistent support for double-linguistic education make Obam’s response easier to predict.
While Obama agrees that migrants should learn English, he recently trivialized when he said that people should stop worrying about the English law.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to delete performance differences, he should rather be thinking about educational patterns that work, rather than laughing and trivializing them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic concerns
The oil prices in Monday have fallen sharply because of the fear that even the American plan to save the financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of the termed oil trades decreased in the morning trade at the New York Commodity Exchange by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Last Monday, the price dropped by more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodities markets were shaken by financial distress on Wall Street and also two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching the maxima of 145,29 dollars for barrels in July, this month, prices almost 90 dollars per barrel, which came back on the wave of the tremendous uncertainty of the financial markets.
Anxiety reopened investors on Monday, even after the Congress Bureau announced that the weekend has reached an agreement on the greatest rescue plan in history.
This report has been clarified by the recent concerns that the financial crisis is far from the end.
In the latest episode of the progressive decomposition, the government announced that the Citigroup group would buy the Wachovia Corporation banking section.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, the Dutch and Luxembourg government partly became the European financial conglomerate of Fortis.
Barclays Capital's analysts said that a scattered weekend negotiations that led to a plan to save the economy, "is shown as incapable of revitalising the mood in the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decrease.
"The tours for global shares, interest rates and exchange rates have been severely disagreeable," wrote the analysts from Deutsche Bank in the report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From commodity perspective, our greatest concern is to what extent the American virus will spread to all over the world and especially to China."
The analysts of this bank have reduced their expectations for the next year, since oil consumption has decreased due to slower growth in the economy and reduced its forecasts for gas prices for 2009 by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter has passed the record of the team
After he spent more than anyone in Jets' jets in the last eight season, the defensive Shaun Ellis player thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter in which Jets turned the pointless game in a splendid ride.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizon Cardinals balanced their grieving clouds over themselves.
Then the quarterback, Brett Favre, sent Laveranuese Coles to the 12-tiyard touchdown sprint, perfectly recognizing the afternoon in which their progressive cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this neighborhood behind the other two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half the game.
"It was nothing special," Favre said about all his Coles' credits.
"He's a damn good player.
We've been communicating perfectly, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked the quarterback of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a misguided throw and brought him back at 32 yards to the touchdown.
Security, Eric Smith, hailed another credit card and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to make the rifle.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, might have been the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely 20yard goal from the field, which he won the 34-0 leadership.
That's the most Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe this madness, he said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points without answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
Many points have fallen in a short time section."
Starting Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best remote runner at all when on Sunday in Berlin's Maraton overcoming his own world record and became the first man who ran 26,2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a nice flat track at 2:03:59, he turned 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, which is 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - overcoming the world record or at least is a world champion at all distances from metric miles to maraton.
Last month, Gebreselassie left the Olympic Maratón in Beijing because he was afraid - from a recurring point of view - that the polluted air would crush his problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the target - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a lightning diameter of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As trackers like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer track, the Maraton record in the past decade has dropped by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told the journalists that he had cramps in a meadow two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break was more of a wake up than she could hold him off.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I was in a little bit of doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, the east African rival of Ethiopia - because he said he was overthrowingly planning his races, generally avoiding the world’s maraton tips, relying on guides, as if it were a race on the track, and building world records over the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half at 1:02:04.
After the conductors were gone, the two elite Kenya Runners of James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi were constantly chasing Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie last took and escaped Kwambai, which then ran second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended the third time at 2:07:48.
In the race of women, the excellent year of the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mitienková, the family of Kazakhstan, which is now the citizen of Germany.
Record Time 2:15:25 holds Paula Radcliff from Great Britain.
Sixty-year-old Mikitienková surprisingly won last spring in London Maraton at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games left behind because of something described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third maraton, which has ever run, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
The race was clever and thoughtfully run: she left four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to a great start and then reached them about 18⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Etiopie took the second one at 2:21:31 and Helene Kipropová from Keni ended the third time at 2:25:01.
The hearts and obstacles of the life of black people in a separate city
Hidden between the vast amusement parks of the Great Orlando, a few miles from all the glossy, smooth and giant, lies a quiet town in which he enjoys the pride and the afroameric life.
Eatonville, the first completely black town, which was integrated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three croquet poles, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough coffee, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrim place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora's annual Zora's Zion Festival to make the hunch of Hurston, the most famous female writer of Harlemian Renaissance.
The city that she described remains aside, even though she made it a stop for tourists by integrating it into a floridian tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the economic crisis.
He's still independent, dignified and private, like in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the country blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows so little that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the Black President's candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on races, many residents here remain cautious to the views of strangers.
"We are very careful about our story," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as paradox triumph and effort.
It's like a historical model of the black rise, and a community of almost 2400 people, where poverty is doubled compared to the national average.
It is the centre of literature, but also the oaks, as well as the example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - which came from American slavery.
It's not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about the idea of Eatonville really began with Zora, which is the only way to say Hurstons here.
She introduced her native city to the world through heartly books full of strings as "Mules and Men (Mules and men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florid tourist guide changed the city a bit into road 17, which leads through the often mixed centre of Florida, in the stage of black history and human drama.
With the prosecution of the great drum in life and in the literature, Hurston's reader introduced Joe Clark's first eatingville mayor, and then turned into a more personal place.
"On the left beside the road," she wrote, "it's a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintened courts and a field that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned the new widow's husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn's "sales drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville interconnected with self-government, but also with illiteracy, reopening marriages and sex.
Obviously this wasn't a typical Fodor's publisher.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson's corpses that Hurston made immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"some people didn't like it," she added.
He still remembers Hurston as a clean ecstasy, which often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
The 7th century Augustus Franklin remembers that, most of the time she came to town, she arrived without announcement in a tremendous Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is proud to wear decent clothes today.
Most people have been fascinated, said Franklin, but many have been shattered.
"People of Zora always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, he swings on a chair on the back terrace with a view of the lake of Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "Never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to forget her with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, the current Langston Hughes and the only black girl at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Floridian Fort Pierce, where she lived before.
There were no larger sadness ceremony in Eatonville or a large public reading.
"I don't think that even her meaning for the world, or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, the author of the Hurston CV "Wrapped in Rainbows (Wrapped in the rainbows)" published in 2003.
Change came in the '80s of the 20th century.
The Orange County headquarters wanted to stretch through the city by a five-way road instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way main road.
Orlando's spread has already pushed interstate highway 4 through the west edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still receiving from a complex historical period.
The forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the fight against the mixing of races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
" At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and stuff on the people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady who killed it.
They threw melons out of the car."
In the letter of The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the requirement of the highest court for forced integration and his decision in the Brown case against the education chamber, she said that it was "for my race insulting rather than glorifying."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although in some areas was positive, reduced coherence in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the young people here.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville community).
That lasted until teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't cover your white teacher because your white teacher-- I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to create a space for many other Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists, who, like her, have raised themselves over prejudices with lightly self-consciousness and quotes such as "How can someone enjoy my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975 Alice Walker was counting on the unmarked grave of Hurston and she began to fight for resurrecting her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the police in the bookstore, a praised Hurston CV from Robert E. Hemenway, who rebuilt her into the American cannon.
The project with the highway just arrived at the moment the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the lights of the ramp again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a savior.
In order to show what could happen to its highway destroy, the community started planning the Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and every January returns to the celebration.
Following a few years from the highway proposal, the state has reschedule.
"The five highway streams resurrected, you'd say it's directly fired, real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd just said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Exteriorities such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to go to the church here in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and the inhabitants began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to the re-emphasized and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a floridic anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes act as a fallen street in the summer rain, as small as it was based with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come looking for a story and meaning of Eatonville, they are often treated with caution.
The permission for most interviews is necessary in advance and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest Jedongville church, painted by white people and displaying black people in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher who likes to be red, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival expanded, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, working, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, shows sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police she says she would use some help.
And even younger, like eleven-year-old twins from the Winter Park of Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, they learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"A large number of people, when they just pass through, they think, "Hm, this town is nothing against the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look into history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently financially.
Nothing's changed at first sight.
If the tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stands and giant TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They never would have decided that in the glass bee they have offices over their heads every day bankers and managers of investment funds who monopolise New York, the worst "basket day in the office" from the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still ripping metal wheelchairs on the sidewalks and transferring muffin bakers to the breakfast meeting.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty wheat shirts hanging from the weights on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street cafeteria, and there's still no way to get a yellow taxi on every day between 4:00 and 7:00.
It didn't look like a crisis until I had, with all the talks about pessimism, decided to set up a saving account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I've had this task so that I could hide with the late afternoons at my local office JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in the front.
Not in front of the cash windows to pick up or save cash, but before the counter, where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a way to trade with mixed Macy's goods and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "clinical personal banker" came for the same reason as I did.
But against me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They took the money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to construction-saving), cash unions and those types of savings, whose branches operate only in one state, and claiming that they are taking care of their customers as a family.
In the last 15 year, such banks were quietly destroyed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, an asset bank of $327 billion, an audition, and when the New Yorkers returned home on Friday night, tried to hunt another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, to hunt a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse, transferred their cash to a bank which is seen as a safe harbour and which makes most saving on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers learned fluently financially in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and expressed herself to Lehman Borthers, the bank that was stolen, and to her extinct top executive Dick Fuld worker with such familiarity as if she was scoffing about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, uniformed about a fifty-year-old homehouse of my arrogant, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said to me, "I have my savings now in the funds of the cash market.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-hand side of the Freedom and Philip Dewinter from the Belgian right-hand side of Vlaams Belang, participates in the manifestation presented in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, "City against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to the traffic markings that display mosques crossed by the red line.
The police accuses right-wing extremists of desecration of Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties have gained huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in the city of Traun near Linza was sometimes between Friday night and this morning severely destroyed and the police are convinced that it was an organized action.
The guilty used some Jewish symbols, such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred to Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was any connection to the choices.
The spokesman of the Islamic community here said that they are deeply shocked by reports of desecration, which come at the moment when the Muslim post moon Ramadan is nearing the end of the Muslim post moon.
Meanwhile, Austria enters its own soul into the round of search after the transport went down in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both extreme right-wing parties, which have gained more than 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom and the Union for the future of Austria, led a vehemently anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobia.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Freedom Party, who gained over 18 percent of the votes, protested against sharks and beets in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods in which the relationship with Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood" to prevent Islam from rise.
Both sides are trying to prohibit the construction of mosquitoes and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections which have built an extreme right to position the strongest political block in the country suggest that this change has been mainly caused by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter must not take a trip beyond the border
Gary Glitter, the glamrocc star, convicted of sexual abuse of children, banned the court to travel to France and Spain.
The officials have imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he intends to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were agreed on this ban on travelling last Thursday after she handed over to officials evidence of Glitter's previous judgments for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, owned by Paul Gadd, did not participate in a hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
Speaker of court said: "On Thursday, 25 September at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kent Police requested a regulation that would prevent Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel to foreigners, as he had filed on the sex attackers' records.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also forward the planned date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If the duty to inform the authorities is omitted, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent Police have announced that the individual cases of Glitter's possible journeys after the county will not be discussed.
The speaker of the Kent Police said, "The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in Britain because there are extensive systems that can handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kenta's residents is the highest priority for the Kent police and we work carefully to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual offenders so that we reduce any danger to the public to a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass through the passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at the heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully ordered him to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for the possession of child pornography for four months.
The source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, Minister of the Interior, is quiet and glad that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To catch the real character, I take the master's picture off the scene." Günther Bauer is a photographer.
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, distracted from the focus on interpretation - I am just about to achieve the liberated expression of a man or woman.
On the one side of the artist.
Second - human.
Indifferent, if we omit privacy, in moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, a depth of the lethal viewed view or passionate gestures of hands that are careless because they do not want to step out on the scene.
Germany Günther Bauer replaces the theatre performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less known face of masters.
With this purpose, the photographer builds a unique iconography of flamenca from various environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the month's flamenca photograph (Mes de la Photografía Flamenca), "reflecting the growing international flamenca significance", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people portraited "on the street" are capable of passion, sorrow, joy... and totally delight the viewers.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take photographs on stage.
They wear their personality and character inside.
I was wondering the creation of a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenca.
Amazed by the festival "Cante de las Minas" Bauer began in 1997 a long trip portraiting of flamenc singers, guitarists and dancers on board cameras.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of camera and material, remind classical photographs.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical base of the image and lends to him the present spirit, which is the idea that according to Bauer himself also reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which does not stop surpriseing and evolving."
What strays the viewers is not the effect of the dance itself, the singing or the game, but the personality and character of the artist.
Searching for the moment when we meet the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experience, it was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery of El Fotómata.
This choice of almost 70 photographed artists create known flamenca figures, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenca anthology and soon reaches a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraiting brought Bauer to the idea two years ago to repeat the idea of "SportARTproject" on "SportARTproject".
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to recognize them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think it's a portrait of the most difficult genre in the photograph.
You meet or face people, people who don't even know, or give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite such circumstances as a photographer, I always try to realise my imagination."
The collection of current flamenca portraits called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedou de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel that writes is "thuddenness"
It is held in a environment that does not yet know, and tells about events for him unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement its new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in Congo and traveled even in Amazonia.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prizes for literature was admitted at the Hay Festival of Segovia yesterday at the festival that the project that currently employs him is "it's resentment", and that "all suggests that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I do it, and I believe I'm gonna finish it once," he ended his contribution to the exchange festival of ideas, thoughts and words that he saw in the city around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in four days.
The author of the novel "City and Dog" was one of the main figures of the third year of the festival of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens "Our mutual friend" - filled Juan Bravo theatre in the last place.
With Félix Rome, who said it, had a dedicated audience in front of him, whose hour of time ran like water - Peruan with great accuracy and a notable mood of humor, remembering how he wrote "disciplinated" from the original "disciplinated adventure" of the "famous reader" and "powering to live more than I lived" was born by literary missions; as "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinated," carefully rewrites and rewrites; or how they influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "the memories images" are the novel foundation of his stories.
Hispano-American Romanographer admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent the books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, fleeing experience" - stressed Vargas Llosa, saying that according to him "people work" and "such as they try to turn out from the line" and called the writers not to be subject to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of the climateology, the festival is lost in Pozoblanc - a missing spear
The performance with the spears that closes the festival in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the proving that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermín Bohorquez, Pable Hermosou de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
The unfavourable meteorological conditions have long been succumbing this feast, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the other planned bull fights.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautist were to build bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
That's how it was celebrated on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and reward for a dynamic and aesthetically quality performance was carried out on the shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two wounds of copies for the greetings and one ear that brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreador art.
Even worse, there was El Juli who went through the bull arena Los Llanos saintless.
In the second round of the work without one breath, most of the audience earned a sharp criticism.
They took control in Alava in a van with two thousand pounds of hashes
Ten minutes five.
Road control Ertzaintza in the city district Armiñón (Alava).
Accomplices stop two people in the van and they drive them.
The cost, more than two tons of hashis, is not stopping.
According to the report from the Basque Government Department, the members were chased and arrested by one of the people in the van, a man aged 38, identified as A.A. J.
The detained was accused of smuggling drugs and falsification of state documents.
An incident occurred when several carriers carried out road control at the N-1 locations passing through the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop the van for control, but the driver didn't follow the instructions, speeded up and left.
The car began to prosecute immediately when the vehicle stopped by a few kilometres away, at that point both passengers jumped and fled to the forestry.
The Ertzaints eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of the hashes, which the suspects carried out, as it appeared in the search of the supply of Iveco Daily.
Back part of the vehicle was loaded hashes packages which were subsequently transported to other police departments to detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "screwed" and disagrees with the data contained in the delivery documents, and was therefore also accused of falsification of state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for another suspect who, as already mentioned, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the confiscated drug.
Arrested A.A. J., 28 years, was transferred to the police department to deal with appropriate formalities before he later joined the investigation.
An actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of medications
Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) behind the drive under the influence of medications.
The witness saw her perform an unusual maneuver when she tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito, told the magazine People spokesman of California Road Watch.
The Witness stated that around 16:30, Locklear "whispered hardly on the gas, for a loud beeping, she joined the front and back and tried to get out of the parking place - she retreat a couple of times wishes for sunglasses."
The Witness, who didn't seem to know the actress, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on the nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was afraid of Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the car.
"She seemed disoriented," and that's why she was taken to a specialised drug and alcoholic center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was eliminated by the incision, but "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medications, which was evident to officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained for suspicion of management under the influence of the unspecified substance and around 19.00 was taken into custody, even though several hours later she was released for freedom.
Two months ago, Locklear came back from a medical clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the IU andalusian association to apply its powers in the Kauze Silva
The General Chief of the IU and the MEP for the All-Level Gaspar Llamazares today said that the final decision in the Kauze of the former Council of Youth and Sports Council in Seville Francisca Manuel Silva, who resigned from the office last week after he was accused of dealings in favour of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am an excessive federalist, he is on the andaluian organization to exercise his powers," said Llamazares, to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
The Head of the IU insisted, however, that in the case of an illicit investigation that Silva had committed, it is absolutely necessary to "transparent": "IU has always fought for such matters to be maximally transparent."
He also emphasized that the party had a "strequent ethical code for all public functions".
"The Flower Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garci's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "The Flower Blood" (Sangre de mayo), to which he was inspired by Episodes from the national history of Benita Péreze Galdós, revitalizing the famous rise of the Spanish against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator wanted to "depict the illustration of figures and analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous romance, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of a picture before a large team of interpreters.
The flower blood with metrazy over two and a half hours will be placed in the cinema this Friday and in the future there will be more than a four-hour TV show for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary creation of Galdóse José Luis Garci claimed that he had done the film "child dream" for which Esperanza Aguirre owed him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid by filming the two-year anniversary of Madridsky May 2, he accepted the offer that the story would be based on the Epizod National past.
The budget of 15 million, which has fully contributed to the Madrid Province, means for Garci's "one opportunity" to create a environment with scenery and costumes corresponding to the image of the "crisping Spain, which was wrong in the leader who went to fight - the fight for independence led under the government of Ferdinanda VII to the bankruptcy and occupyment of the country," said.
But the director regrets that he can't count on financial support that got to the films The Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy's visions - almost twice the Flower Blood - he couldn't make some scenes from the scenario signed simultaneously by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he works almost all over his film route.
The director of the film "Initiate again" (Volver and empezar) works as normal - on the scene with the actors who usually try and who don't choose casting because it feels "sponsive" and also believes that "part of the profession of the director is, among other things, to go to the theater and cinema and learn what is happening in the arts that deals with".
Many actors who chose for Flower blood appear in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations in Oskara, one of which he has obtained, is the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the lonely Flower Blood, the Seven tables of the French biliary and the last selected blind sunflower, is not the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to appear".
For this film, Garcia does not expect any awards.
"In the beginning, you think you're working for what's going to be done after, but then you realize you're only working for money, and so you're allowed to make another film," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bayón revitalizes the spiritual link of seville dancer Tórtoly Valencia
Seville's flamenca dancer will give up another seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Katalánka (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusanky's mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on the oriental dance.
She lived her life full of passion, she was a pioneer of women's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of a correlation that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman affected by the dance and aesthetic revolution of Isabela Bayón's interwar Europe.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she suggested this character -- it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, it's not about telling her life, it's about grabbing the soul.
The names of her dance shows remind me of flamenca rhythms.
So the butterfly dance evoked me guajira or "snake dance" some thong.
Her dance was meaningful, and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also fits," he says.
The show is calculated by the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel They will lead Isabela to sing in one performance as well as in the "Open doors" (La puerta abierta) and with the teacher of Matilde Coral dance, who made an exception to working with her former purity.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtole, mature character.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor to me."
The show also includes music and guitars of Jesúse Torrese and Paca Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; drums of El Pájara, violou Rafa El Violy and co-workers of Juanfry Juarez, "which is the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist who are primadonami with all things, and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman who has played for his time in so far as India, the United States or Russia are, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her, and then she appreciates her creation," says Bayón.
The show starts today at 8:30 at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The book "Dennial of Fresh Female" closes also the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of Zenobia in March 1916 is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous andalusian government to celebrate "Trienále Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Nobel's award for literature and anniversary of their death.
"Trienále Zenbie and Juan Ramón" is at the end of the new edition of this work, an international congress that will be held in New York, by repairing Nobel's museum house and traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen the sun beam", which was opened in May this year, and after circumventing various andalusian provinces, it should be, according to the plans of the Congress at the time of the Congress, moved to New York.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Dennik of Fresh Female" modified by Pedre Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to disseminate the awareness of the personality and works of one of the worldly andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much anymore.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who cooperated with him on "Without a bad intention," and under the utmost knowledge that Newman left, reveals his unhappy vision of abandoned American cinema and all America.
Look how long it took them to get Oskar.
And he's retired since 2007.
And that they knew he was very sick.
Still, he was a man for all of them.
"Sometimes what you feel can't express in any way, and now I've lost a great friend," he said in the tears of Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better thanks to him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of the film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at the time when the American self-confident is at the bottom of which desperately seek reasons for pride.
When the time is tough and people without virtue and just a handful of those who admire you - there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opposer of Richard Nixon and the fighter for lost and won cases, from the drug addiction founded on the honor of the first-born son who died of an overdose to his own brand of domestic food and bio-diesel.
A full treasure for the country, which was worth a lot of efforts to reverse itself from the suicidal food culture.
The stormy wave of admiration has flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, said there was no one dead, but one whole era.
Another Englishman, Oskar's holder, Sam Mendes, said working with Newman, was no big deal at the top of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, to mark Newman's oven as his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox put a pretty high line on all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman's life, based on honesty and leads a serious private life far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in the media jungle today, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He's divorced once, and since then he's been married 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, even though he had more than enough chances not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have filet at home?" He liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven that his daughters and admirers are on the earth - it's not very common in America.
They say, "of all the great roles he has embodied, he was the most delicious role of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrificed philantrope."
Imperfect Olympic Madrid races
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed year 2012, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're going to race last night, I'm saying no!
They talked about him as a perfect race, and according to my court, he was the worst thing I've ever been to.
Such a lot of nonsense, that right now, if there was an evaluation and I was trying, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's take a look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense starts with picking up a racing number for which you have to go early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent the crossing of the track).
Oh, no.
Here you must first pick up a number (first nonsense, go there only because of that) and (after standing the right front) - what a surprise! - they had only a T-shirt of size S (the second nonsense, because I need the size of XL).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis, they only decided to buy a little shirt because it's less substances and they're cheaper?
Okay, that's a small thing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Except it had to go for a chip very early and the front lasted for 15 minutes, he had to put his backpack back there.
Over 35 minutes, waiting time, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as you could expect, the race started, and we haven't postponed the bags yet, and when it's done, it was much worse with picking up.
In addition, waiting for a 40-minute rain, which led to general rebellion and cabin attack.
I believe that 500 of us will have an inflammation of the air tomorrow, and some of us like me will not show the right time to evaluate the results for the chip they gave me and which, as I assume, did not record me the right start time.
Of course, if anyone asked me about some perfect race, this one wouldn't have attacked me.
And so I think we're gonna have to have a well-prepared Olympic town just to dream.
Microsoft is looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interactions on a way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of doing basic acts as calling taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire area of society) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognises the shapes and faces, this "receptional" can find out how many people are in the room - even remember what they're wearing - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
He can also distribute those present according to the conversation groups.
On the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and will understand that he is not part of the group that talks to her, and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see someone, and she's telling her she's about to take care of her.
It's all without a blue screen of death.
Fantastic.
But that's, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as the new version of Windows operating system.
This week has talked a lot about changing the Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found out that if the computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial use, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as a thunder when we consider that Microsoft version adds new functions to Windows and other "extra".
Change of direction would be a merity act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing meaning, and it's similar to the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhere to the theory that it was the first step Googlu to competition with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system not as the absolute truth, but to the truth relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and on the contrary to more web browsers.
The computer starts to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the internet than around windows.
What is half of the applications accompanying the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less hard, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
Desperately they need it, and here's a little example.
I made this photo in one restroom for Microsoft staff in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine that asks them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, it showed an independent study that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search online.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It's not coming to the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count until 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly try to put Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone becomes more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore him on the Azur coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one of his cheeks in Edward Zwick's Crazy Diamonds, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotr" Francis Ford Coppoly, and he is also part of a muscular uniform of the gay community.
And if we want to go into his life's roles, we can dive to the picture of a typical muscle with a pointy moustache that lifts off the coat circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton man's underwear, adhesive and sleeveless.
The English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels is exceling all the others.
First of all, for his shilling name - even though people call him 'Marcel' - which has a connection with sport, because, as legend says, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lovers of Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label, and (as not less unknown) belgic flag that have models of the most emblematic plates as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't specialize only on tank tops.
He also produces sweatshirts college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, kids dresses, mini shorts...
Designed pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother who's a father doesn't bother me."
The great likeness of her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, although minor figures, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters take their new action in fashion very seriously.
It means much more to Munica than just some nice, famous girls will lend their name.
In Paris, the promotional action by Mango was held in its new headquarters, as well as the publication of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartless and shy, and she's getting you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came here to introduce a new collection that we proposed for Mango this autumn-winter with Sister Penélope, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in the Opera to honor Valentine.
So it was a difficult, but also an exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango, for which you're working on the fourth season?
My sister and I love the films from the '50s and '60s, and we have pumped many of them.
I also love torching around the city and watching women walk dressed like they combine and throw my clothes, that's what I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but at the end, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I may have enjoyed clothes for a while, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, talk to my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
That was sensation, almost better than going to the pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I've always tried to take care of how I go dressed.
You know, we dancers are based on how we're adapted to make us feel good at our hours and tests when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you'll really penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect to designers and professionals.
You're 30 years old, have you been in a crisis?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever before, I'm thirty-five.
I find that a woman is already finished, has experience, and life enjoys less errors.
Biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've been doing what I want for a little while, and that's giving me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants to, and besides, I want to be a young mommy, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father is concerned, I don't worry about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I'll let my baby experience a feeling of happiness, and I'll raise him with great love.
As for the movie, a few film premieres you've filmed last year are waiting for you.
It's true, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I come from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and that's not how I can do it, of course.
I look forward to the premiere "La última mountain" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
See how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on a parade mound by Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm going up to the pier as a model.
She only called me by Naomi Campbell, which I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend the Beneficiary Show for her organization "Women for a better life", and the clothes we've been showing - I have chosen two models from our collection for Mango - and the profit was handed over to this Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things to say about her, and I, since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good guy in which he's involved.
She asked me to show for charity, but if she asked me to make a stand, I'll do it.
For the sake of women of the third world, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers are going to have to install "alcolock" with alcohol in their blood.
The Ministry of Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol-controlling must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car in drunkenness or if he doesn't breathe.
The proposal has already been known in June this year and is now already included in the Annual Report of the Supreme State Prosecutor, according to which this is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to reverse the driver behind the wheel, and therefore drivers will also have to take the course of traffic transfers.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, this experience will also participate in the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics between 30 and 75% of automobiles accused more than once for drinking in this state, it is re-used as a wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the authorised alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds EUR 1,000, and it would have to be paid by the guilty man himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that, during the first year of the introduction, the transgression rate decreased by 65 % for vehicles equipped with this facility.
In Spain, it counts that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure shall be limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behaviour before it enters into a criminal offence.
And in order to help the introduction, as the legislation can be made in a normal manner, however, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The facility is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been installed on the market.
At the same time tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE proposal (Spanish Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, as it stood in the program at 17:40, it landed at the presidential hangar at the Benita Juáreza airport in México D. F. aircraft of the Spanish air force in which the prince and princess of Asturia traveled.
The sun just fell, but his rays had yet to clan their hands to see the successive couple coming out of the plane.
Under the meeting, the Spanish ambassador and other officers were standing.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to a state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, that's not gonna get to the airport picking people up... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spain, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
However, the Mexican press knows who the prince and princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
A lot of people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and military cordon, forming 27 sea soldiers ready to fire an honorary salva.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue color suit, and a princess, very alternately dressed and with her hair spread, has no usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. the storm threatens.
Before they go to the O.R., where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at photographers and they are forced to pose.
In the doors of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Top subsidised fashion price
I don't think there's a more suitable place in the world to publish a fashion price than Paris, and it's probably not a better designer and bonvivated than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised by EUR 300 000.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, took a look at her suggestions yesterday in Manga's position at Haussmann's Paris buffalo number 54 and almost cried out.
Of course, it is the second largest trade in this company in Europe and has just been opened on the area of 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank Valentine's designers for taking over the Presidency of the competition jury, have resulted in our ultimate dinner at Garnier's Paris Opera.
Mango company decorated the presidency table looked a little bit more amazing next to the most remarkable Chagall works.
The Nati who, with her heart broken grief because of the recent death of her brother, had not revealed anything, dressed this brand and ELAH jewelry, over which he kept his breath secret, and hanged into her son Luise - almost a two-meter elegan - accompanied Valentine in the head of the table at his dinner for his honor.
Andik, boss and owner of Mango, took a welcome and as a real gentleman stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket because they both offered them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the trade in - own-designed - pants and shirts, and she was dressed into a long black sexy dress, enjoyed the night walk of Opery as an escort of Goya Toledová, showed us the ballroom and, in memory of other times, she caught one of the bars and indicated "grand plié".
Inés Sastre hadn't stayed on a tour of the palace's side buildings, but before she left, she showed us the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The second morning we could love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own sheets and towels and asked for no smell in his rooms.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh la la la, c'est la vie.
1001 - antistrese number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and furious everyday life.
And so that there is little, they are all summarized in one book that will bring relax to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm rings every morning at 7:00 a.m. for punishment, but it's even worse to imagine itself absorbed in a successful rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stres is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two ways to fight daily exhaustion and the problems to retreat from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside yogina positions, classic massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book gathered all "menu" options, modified according to taste and time options of each individual.
The Protistres book is called "1001 method of relaxation" and thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookshop.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, "the guide" denies this view.
In addition, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If an adrenaline is no longer coined in your veins, which is reattaching the balance, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, shut down and focus on the reading.
Sleeping Talk
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but in fact, it's irrelevant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquia.
She's quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely they told one of you that he spoke of sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (e.g. once a life in high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child doesn't remember anything.
There's only one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nightturna (night soaking) or sleepiness, but it does not have to be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stressful or diverse situations.
In any case, it is a little studyed phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak with a quiet voice, speak individual words, whisper, or on the contrary (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases with great force, it would be appropriate to observe and consult the expert to find out if there is no problem causing great anxiety and thus manifesting itself.
We said it was a harmless disorder, which is why it is not treated only if it is associated with a further disturbance of sleep that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this to keep in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to get too upset before she goes to bed.
Search for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent television programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This baby will allow you to sleep quieter.
When somniloquia appears, try to remain calm.
Remind that it is harmless to the child, and that of what has happened the next day, nothing will be remembered.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because it's not conscious and you're gonna interrupt his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and he rests.
Remember, if it seems to you several times after each other that he is very concerned, it would be appropriate to turn to counsel or find out what causes such anxiety to the child.
If it is to understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It won't be useless, because when she's asleep, she's not conscious to be able to organize her thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming of, and why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you're taking.
Don't ever tell the baby you can ask him at night about his secret.
I'm not even funny.
That causes great anxiety.
Don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to win after a long, skinny period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-earths have created more chances and have made one of them win-win.
The game didn't have too fast during this conflict, in which the attackers were just difficult to enforce.
After the first attempt of the captain, Kauffmann hosts a bullet from a distance just missed the connection, he began having Illhaeusern lightly above and first Fonderflick from a remote distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie defense.
On the other hand, the opponent built a defensive val in the middle of the field and left only agile Riahi on the thunder of the attack.
The beginning of the second half appeared to be decisive, first thanks to the two Dannemarie chances with the names of Riahi and Temporal, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, which took care of Marais, well established for the processing of the ball boiled after the previous Diebold experiment (53').
But Gólman Illhaeuserna has not enjoyed long, but after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the wardrobe and leave his fellow players to weaken.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to recover from it and 11 from Illhaeusern, which just dropped a little bit to "hush" defense, no more caused any more trouble, except the last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the wall after a great confusion.
Sarkozy goes to the angry fishermen
Before leaving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through Brittany.
In order to face the demonstration of the power of fishermen, who have severely distorted the accession of several Bretton and Standardan ports on Monday, the French president decided to go to Guilvinec Harbour in Finistère to meet their representatives.
Lastly, the names promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that "it will come with concrete proposals."
The President’s visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "Crisis Committee" created by the Bretonian fishermen in order to obtain measures against a sharp increase in the price of oil which reached the peak of an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesperson of the Elyse Palace of David Martinon, the president will talk to them about the solutions that can be imagined in trying to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions for employing and paying sailors.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with imbalances.
On Tuesday morning, they performed a "look" operation in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, which caused almost 10km chassis.
Recreational port in Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connection in the direction to Belle-île was not interrupted.
At Quiberon Peninsula, the filtration dam was operated.
The seamen have demonstrated their determination on Monday, when at dawn before the stocks of fuels of ports in Brest and Lorient burned tires and pallets while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the coast of the Atlantic and the la Manche channel, like the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where traulers remained in the port, or to Le Havra, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishers from Turball and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped the blockade of important refinery Total in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act on their own in the middle meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis Committee" is to decide on how to continue on the upcoming road and on its participation in the prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some of the Bretonian fishermen do not want to be represented by the Heads of the State Fisheries Union, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the sailors will not drop from nothing" and "will not come to Paris," said, for example, Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing union.
However, fishermen who do not pay oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, they judge that the fertility threshold of the ship is reached only when the oil is below EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman Splendid
The unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or also Sam Mendes, have boasted the legend of the film and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its assumptions of supply for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies this year on a shipment of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of recession, which is lifted above the world economy.
The fourth air designer in the world, Embraer, retains its assumptions for 2008 with 215 added devices, confirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially with regard to the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To this day, Embraer added 41 devices to Chinese clients in the range of eight years.
It says AIG is considering the transfer of 15 % of its assets
The insurer of the American International Group, whose US cash offices have been over water, is considering he would have gone more than 15% of his assets in order to repay $85 billion given to him as a backup, writes the Financial Times Sunday edition.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying the journal that quotes the sources of close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the Management Board of AIG took place on Sunday night to examine the eventual delegation.
AIG has not been able to obtain any confirmatory statement.
The assets which AIG intends to dispose of include its air leasing pool International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in Transatlantic Holdings Insurance Insurance and its portfolio of real estate and private equity investment, adds FT.
No final decision on these delegations has been adopted, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash to repay the loan of 85 billion provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with a risk that the US authorities will take up 80% of the capital, thus dividing it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an unseen loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777,68 points to 10 365,45 points.
On September 17, 2001, on the day of renewal of trade after terrorist attacks from September 11, the largest fall in his history (of 684,81 points).
The Nasdaq index with the overwhelming technological component has lost, according to definite data after the trading closure, 199,61 points and is fixed to 1 983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Since the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally fallen through the unexpected refusal of the plan to rescue the House of Representatives, a plan to allow a little stability to be found on the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he asked for.
Two of the Republicans of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal from the dispatched market, which sees that Congress is not able to accept a certain plan," Lindsey Piegza thinks of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market was relying on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not be too late.
"If this project is truly condemned to vanish... the staff will immediately be handed over to Feda (American Central Bank, notably Red.) and to other central banks to incite the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight economist.
And with emphasis on the urgency of Piegza's situation, she pointed out that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution."
After the Friday end of Washington Mutual, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovi's banking activities by her rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took turnovers and requested urgent interventions in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which suggests that markets do not face "only American crisis, but the world crisis", added an analyst from FTN Financial.
The market with bonds has risen strongly.
The cash flow to 10 years decreased to 3,632% compared to 3,827% on Friday night, revenue for 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4,357 % of the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House followed the second debate, whose task was to find out who won John McCain and Barack Obama.
The leadership tents of the Republicans and the Democrats did not surprise when they both declared their victory in the TV duel that followed the third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, however decent, was not "billing" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, a decline in surveys.
The Gallupa Institute, whose public opinion survey published on Saturday, attributes a five-point lead to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrat is the one who won in duel.
Among the undeclared voters that matters right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of the subjects, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% attributes the victory to McCain.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm its leadership on Thursday by means of the expected good performance of his co-chairman Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented," he alerted about Bill Clinton's weekend.
The seventh McCain constantly raised his inspirable experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing the "naiveness" of his opponent in questions that formed the core of the first conflict.
"It seems Senator Obama didn't understand that..." there was a recurring accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama had sufficient experience and knowledge to become president," he also secured.
In such an attacking spirit, the Republican television spots haven't occurred since yesterday.
On the other hand, Obama pointed out that he was the future.
He didn't lose his head and turned out to be short and precise.
He elevated his ability to take the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still did not understand while Obama did," said on a democratic spot that the Republican claims that he is not sufficiently taking into account the impact of the crisis on the "current American".
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered at a pre-electoral meeting in North Carolina for a sharp rain.
He didn't even say "Central Class" or "working". The financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider to save the economy at the edge of the propasti.
"In the next week, he could make a decisive vomit," estimated yesterday the democrat senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic prospectiveness" to the one that Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the Democrat candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of the eight-year-old bad economic policy, as George Bush operated and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois reaffirmed that over the unexpected Wall Street jumps he should be able to reduce the tax of 95% of the Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the eventual energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy sources is its priority number one, along with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain's planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions regarding the financial assistance plan of $700 billion (470 billion) which adopted the Congress last night and which is strongly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opposers of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Bělorus gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closure of the election rooms in the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of elections to Parliament.
Although no results have yet been declared, many young people came to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenek: "diktator, demissi".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the election: "What would it be if they'd do whatever they wanted with my voice anyway," says a young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to take a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian sexmen and the freezing of certain assets, may be abolished if the elections are considered to be net.
According to the opposition, it wasn't.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of the votes," Juri Potěmkin, spokesman of the Union of democratic forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," emphasises Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leader personality of the pro-European movement, "because it is essential who counts the votes, and we are the executive power.
If opposition Members get to Parliament, they will be appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament may mean space in television, meetings in regions and laws proposals."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be launched.
If our economy is deeply debtd with Russia, the crisis will be affected, and we do not reform ourselves, we are threatened to become a Russian anti-treatment.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the elections, should not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of premature voters (26% voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there have been elections?" There is a social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"In the election rooms there was no foot.
And there will be at least five opposition Members in Parliament, those who are most consistent with the regime."
The night silence came back to the October square.
On TV, President Lukaszenko and members of the Central Electoral Board congratulate for success.
Interview - Blood that's sure again
Héma-Québec celebrated last night the tenth anniversary of the founding and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was legitimately rejoicing, since Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and inefficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the confidence of the public, which was seriously shaken after the scandal with contaminated blood in the '80s and '90s.
As generally known, the state reserve of blood managed by the Red Cross Transfusion Department has been contaminated by a virus of immune deficiency (HIV) and a C hepatitis virus in the 1980s.
In view of this drama and wave of the public, the Canadian government launched a public investigator chaired by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, which aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such tragedy, and formulating recommendations to prevent such disasters being repeated.
While Judge Krever continued to submit a report, some provinces have put the committee in place to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was played by the Gélinea Committee.
After Gélineau's and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was intended to manage Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for supplying all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec began his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people had still confidence in the quebetic blood system," she recalls Dr. Décary.
"Situation was stunning.
Consistent efforts to increase the safety of blood products and permanent work in this area over the next few years have been restored to the public's confidence," says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008, Héma-Québeku trusted no longer 94% of the Quebean population.
Dr. Décary nevertheless doesn't lose her mind that "confidence is something very fragile."
Since he was founded on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the principle of prudenty.
"We have now witnessed many human forms of sickness of crazy cows, new variants of disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," reports the woman who has led the company since its foundation of 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
We were therefore based on one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, in case we do not know and when there is a risk of proliferation of serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which is characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, must be taken excruciating measures.
In April 1999, we therefore refused blood from people who were staying in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease was transmitted to blood.
So this episode has shown us that keeping up with the principle of prudentity has made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT), which allow the donor blood to reveal directly the presence of the virus itself, not the presence of antibodies on which the founded tests were used before.
The NAT tests have allowed to reduce the deaf period between the moment of the patient's infection and the moment when our techniques in the blood may be revealed by the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing and without finding out.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk that he gets HIV contaminated is exposed to one of 12 million people today.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets HIV infected.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs through the blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions necessary to heal," says the head of Héma-Québek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what a diseaseful element can occur in the system.
Just last year, on Réunion Island, a virus of chikungunya appeared, which, like the West Nil virus, is transferred to blood by insect stabbing.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," Dr. Décary continues and stresses that Héma-Québec must also count with sufficient supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donors network, which in average consists of 3% of Quebeans permissible to donation."
Every healthy person ages at least 18 years, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can only give blood once every 56 days, that means six times a year.
In average, 14% of people offering blood is not accepted because, for example, AIDS or malaria carriers, and if they have visited the country where the bahenna winters are running, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that corresponds to the needs of hospitals.
The shortcomings are very rare.
However, members of the donor networks need to be complemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer give blood.
But persuade people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep and stimulate them to become regular donors.
Life is so unsettled today, that we can only find an hour to give blood," Francine Décary will be posting.
With the annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec delivers not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplantates, heart valves, eyebulves and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Héma-Québek, which also manages the only public bank of blood from the puppet line in Quebec.
Puppet cord, which has previously been considered as biomedical waste, spills blood-rich on stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of blood samples from the puppet line to the bank and we assume we're taking over a thousand of them a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplantation," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the programme of blood collection from the puppet cord as a very popular one.
"some moms are disappointed that they have no access to him," because Héma-Québec has no means to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Impact Montréal last night at the Saputo stadium during the second and at the decisive match of a quarterfinal played for the total number of gates qualified to the semifinal round of the first division USL, thanks to the victory 3:1 (4:3 is a goal balance after both matches) over Sounders of Seattle.
Founder Antonio Ribeiro gave a decisive goal in the 90th minute game.
After the two-way defenseless first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino were planted with two other goals of montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to deal with Matt Jordan for Sounders.
Remind me that on Friday, during the first of the two quarterfinals, Impact suffered in Starfire Complex in Tuquile at the suburb of Seattle defeat 2:1.
The Impact will measure its forces in the semifinals with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, Thunder balanced the domestic deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, Whitecaps, however, went to the semifinal wheel with the total number of gates 5:4.
The Impact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Shortly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking Trinity of Canadien is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrei Kosticina last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 for separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of a meeting, shot a goal, Plekanec assembled two assists and Kovalev cleaned up one of the three-colored games in this fourth win.
Kovalev assured the victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said Rus.
"I need another game to make me feel good."
"In the first third he tried to handle too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets north
Prime Minister does not exclude premature elections by the end of the year
At the end of the Liberal Party Convention (Parti libéral) Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebek, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc is running in today's additional elections.
"Drop the border of our last large north border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually intense way at the end of the Québek Liberal Party Convention in Lévis, but without telling details.
During his speech, pictures were shown in a kind of painting mill behind his back.
On three giant canvas, a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
A generous means, like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that in autumn he would have triggered premature elections, even though he pointed out that he had a very loaded programme.
The "North Plan" constitutes the fourth dimension of "see", which the Prime Minister intends for Québec, the vision of "new economic space", which includes the agreement with France on working power, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Agreement with Ontar.
Despite the opening of the North - North Territories to 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North represents "clamp with enormous potential", however, the deadline, the amount of investment, nor the clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further distributed: in particular water power plants, forests, especially the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's reading, contains "nic, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice as much as France is with us" is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, but he's in us," he emphasized as if he wanted to show that he was calling a particular national founder's myth.
Quebec was built to a great extent in relation to the North, he elevated the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, James' bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he shut down the theater to look at a huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes part of the Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, has specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is one of the traditional attitudes that have repeated all the governments of the past.
There is one border line that has no Convention for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, in the name of the government, I will take this attitude again," he indicated.
Otherwise, "in the context of climate change, it is also necessary to reconsider our vision of the North", said when he spoke about the transition of the north-west, which is open for the entire year.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that the territory becomes obligatory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebean government will be very careful to them and that the project will be useful to them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the former pequist member of Ungava) have already launched negotiations with about thirty communities.
Activities have begun by the Interministerial Committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and has an important position in Julie Bouletová (Transport and natural resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "the common vision will be set out".
In addition, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "commonly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "see" as a fluent follow-up to the vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Only as liberals who preceded us, we changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the constantly shattered topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail elevating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's entrance to the forehead of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to baptise Beauharnois' headquarters at the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who made a peaceful revolution and the multitude of water electricity, after Bourass, who created James' bay, our party could create the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the "Roads to the North" programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a row came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper garden hydroelectric, Charest emphasized that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying it between us, but I'm planning to be there," he confided to his Member State base, thereby making a great applause.
The same Prime Minister, who in April said that there will not be elections in 2008, and undoubtedly even in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of calling elections in autumn this year, which allows him to act.
However, he emphasized that his programme was loaded, especially with federal council missions in China and Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend convention has provided the leaders of the liberal platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "to change the constitution", which have gone very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party Quebeku) requires particularly the recognition of the "Québeku specialities" in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Quebec would appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Board who would have the right to veta in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposition, the North Plan in its main features was sceptically accepted.
Chief of PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois again pulled out the North Quebek Development Policy, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the government of the liberals came to power in 2003, she renounced the fulfilment of this policy.
If she would hold on to it, "We would continue today", Marois noted by her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said she would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"But we wish it not to be just the theatre," explained Sebastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holiday today.
Letters - Dishonest Land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of justice in Harper's cabinet, who allowed to say about Louis Arbour last summer, that he represents "hanba" for Canada.
In such a way to humiliate a woman who led a unstable fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, this tells a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us, which, as the only of all the Western countries involved, did not go back to the country of its national closed in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even consider that at the time of the actions that he was experiencing, Omar Khader was a young adolescent.
The only government that, although Canada has signed a female convention, denies its word and lets the inhumanity of a child soldier.
The only one that relies on the parodial of justice to judge the guilty of the defendant.
Remind us that UNICEF, Amnesty international and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Advocates defend the repatriation of Omar Khara in order to wait for a fair process in Canada.
The same government closes his eyes before torture: she doesn't care that this young man is mentally destroyed, and that undoubtedly lasted, after so many years of anxiety.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnessing the spicy erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper has so much heed and which of his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no morale anymore: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, misleading him, imprisoning him according to the librarian leader of the minority government so far (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that preaches the virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what has created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renouncement, not elsewhere.
Views - Orwell's discussions by Barrick Gold
In the edition of September 17th, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the Executive Vice President of the Canadian Mining Company Barrick Gold.
With orwell's logic, it confirms that the largest producer of gold in the world has launched the prosecution of three authors and poor little publishers for an insult on honor with a view to calling a "transparent public debate" and demands six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truth, especially in the case of an insult, but a law.
It's not a surprise that Garver is completely overwhelmed by this fundamental resolution.
Or is Barrick Gold the best way to lead public debate, to bring anyone to jail, who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process is going to happen, authors and publishers of Noir Canada's book (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums in order to be prepared to fight and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the army of lawyers supported by almost an endless pocket of the mining company.
Moreover, the tactics in these unstable fears often lies in the ruining of the defendants in order to enforce the conciliation proceedings, which confuse the mouth of the counterparty, and, moreover, scare anyone who dares to serve this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had a view of the whole matter to the public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada, there is a debate in normal circumstances in exchange of thoughts, not in the wounds of footwear.
Therefore, mining companies were not enough to open their books, their documentation and create a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light into the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and the rumour reject petitions and letters to support Noir Canada's authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a public debate, and also deny the public's views?
It appears that this word in the vice president's world indicates only fattening lawyers, and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrowed concept of this concept.
Democracy has the right to talk to Nazis.
Barrick Gold does not - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, is especially because it rejects brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to question and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant should be covered by the mouth (in the framework of his prosecution of "public debate" by the way Barrick has just given the official call to Noir Canada authors to officially inform them that they are to stop using this term...).
If we forget the surreal speech of Garver, the prosecution of the initiated Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of research and the search for truths which are essential to every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote trusted resources and to debate on facts and interpretations that constitute the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without putting ourselves up for repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be created if it were followed by scientific standards that were used by Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The universal environment we belong to is now able to manage debates and disagreements and to address conflicts.
Barrick Gold's overwhelming action clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not want to lead a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would restrict such an unauthorised prosecution.
Operations to Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
Bush administration and congress leaders, both the Republicans and the Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the greatest rescue plan since the 1930 ’ s crisis.
A new version of the plan, with the use of 700 billion US dollars to prevent the financial crisis, which has already been clominated by Wall Street, must still be approved by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses confiscated for failure and also the right to monitor the wages paid to the company managers.
The US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republicans at the meeting table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress, and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush's representative, Henry Paulson.
"It was done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans were safe from the crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and disturbance of everyday American life will be huge," the Republican Judd Gregg declared.
Over the last few hours, the negotiations have run to the maximum turnover of fear from the effect of further investor failure.
The time limit set was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. President were invited to negotiate later and they expressed themselves rather for the agreement, but they did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with the need to act in such a extreme solution.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on some measures, in particular those aimed at allowing owners to keep their residence, and the wise measures of the executives of the state of employment rescued by the companies.
"If we ask the payees to take special measures for the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," explained on TV waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station, whether he would vote for the proposed plan, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"Grubous features I read show that this is something that we all have to spend and through which it will be possible to proceed further.
Election of idleness is simply unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700 milliard plan is to buy for the money of the taxpayers of doubtful claims and risk and non-disposed assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis by breaking the bubbles in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, expanded forms of loans (PCAA) and resulted in freezing cash and banking and financial institutions decomposition.
The fall in the first draft agreement last week has been held by the Republican Members.
Since the Democrats have admitted that for certain "toxic" assets of companies with difficulty the government will only be guaranteed, but will not buy them, there is a conviction that the non-easternal situation is beneficial.
In order to bring together contradictory opinions in Congress, measures have been attached to establishing that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help her recover their deposit if it has to take over losses for five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan counts on the first amount of 250 billion to which another 100 billion will be added if the president considers it necessary.
Another 350 billion deposit should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in rescued companies that will pay dividends in case of profit and will be able to sell again when it's over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the real estate confiscation procedure related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to lay down limits for the amount of assessment and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The uncles of the plan would like to make it a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will have green.
Yesterday, both the Republican and the Democratic camp continued to raise votes against this project.
"It's perfectly obvious that Washington does not hear you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's financial committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no solution to the payees to make money."
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, a moderator of a group of congressmen, called "Sceptical Choir", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"The four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize holders, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine which way to go," said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has reaffirmed that this crisis is a world crisis.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries notified the partial birth of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the Belgian government, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it departed from the purchase of its competitor, which is at the edge of the collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion (EUR 2.9 billion) as a result of the risk credit crisis for buying real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the twenty largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that's what clerks and households can appreciate today's insecure times."
On the other hand, La Manche's channel, seems to have started the British government of multiplying other banks affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing banks of Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion USD) were loans to buy real estate.
According to his last notification, the UK Bank of Santander will purchase branches and client accounts.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank in Northern Rock, which the British government must be born from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially involved icons
His beauty with azurové eyes has long represented his coffin, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor come out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
Ashamedness, sensitivity, and unsimilar talent that he was owned also gave him away from the force category that produces true stars.
But what a long track runner it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat American cinematographic years.
Less spectacular than Brando, who was similar and for a long time had been a rival on the film screen, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Maďar.
These European roots were born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it the whole country was seen in love with the self made mana, a fighter in the Pacifik war, wounded in the battle, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 50th year, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the the theatre, on television and quests in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who was second at the 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, while also a sexual symbol, even though he created a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also leave the tiny places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergy to the habit of its own show-business, which will forever remain mysterious.
A good man, in the most prettiest sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused the dizziness to movie lovers, while his big roles are rival on black canvas memories.
It defines over a half-year-old, constantly transforming American seventh art.
In memory, a charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who refuses his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a hot roof, the adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From the less ancient history (1990) we remember his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at the advanced age of marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many other Pauls of Newman came into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, distressed, violent, unforgettable offender from Someone Up There Likes Me (In signs of hatred) Robert Wise, the roles intended for James Dean, taken after his death, which in 1956 Newman said in real knowledge.
A sympathetic gangster in absolutely great The Sting (Praz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
The hot and vengeful baller player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure of the creation in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him in 1987 the only Oscar of seven nominations.
This face traveling forever, that was him.
And he again.
There are different epochs in his professional course.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the cultious Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers of Coen.
He then closed his career the role of the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends that had soon abandoned the craft, Newman remained in the business for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with his favors, prospects and repercussions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "a live challenge of underplaying", judged that he pushed too much on the saw in his performance.
For a beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles appeared as a lift, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotic, alcoholics, lumps and despairs, whose burning and rebellion reflected in his perfect features.
As director Newman revealed little known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His film Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (by the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He spent his son Scott, who lost for an overdose in 1984, Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sorrow.
His great friend and former co-fiancist Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) griefly said: "His presence was my life and this country was better."
Greatness, love for life, such are the main qualities of a dead actor.
If we forget his legendary career, he also leaves a great civil rights fighter, ecology, independent film, opposing Hollywood's bankruptcy.
We used to see his similarity on the bottles of wine vinegar, saucer, cookies and other foods, which may have seemed rather uncomfortable, although it was a gag at first.
However, profits from sales went to the account of his foundation for difficult childhood.
Newman did, rather than let himself become a fame, until the last moment involved in society.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following phrases: "Everything and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here."
And for us it was an honor to be able to follow the path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the factory for Zuschlag & spol. invoices?
Soon, October 8th, he will start a trial against Janos Zuschlag and his associates.
Politicians and his associates are accused of the fraud of a long-term and systematically criminal organization, which resulted in exceptionally significant damage.
According to the prosecutors, they used the money gained in public competition for their own purposes and were often accompanied by fictional invoices.
The money from the state and governments - a total of about 65 million forints - partly traveled to Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The way he also informed the investigating authority was based on the fact that the money gained in public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices that were not actually counter-valued and the undertakings taken by the associations never received.
According to the defendant, a large part of the invoices was fake.
Prints on these invoices came from the yoosephvaros market, a round stamp was produced in Kiskunhalas.
The names on which the company is supposed to produce invoices have decided, among other things, on the overseas road on the northern coast of Balaton, which Istvána Ladose Janos Zuschlag sent to.
According to his statement, he had first appointed to see the pensions and restaurants.
In them he asked for accounts for his consumption, according to which model, invoices were then produced in public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, acknowledged by the Governing Authority of the capital.
The facts were usually exhibited by István Lados with his partner Andras ▼rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain the subsidy.
On his "study road" Lados looked out one beer.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its companions in 2003, this catering facility provided for the 90-member group of Biztos Pont.
However, so many people would not be included in this facility, according to the claim of the company's head.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the Jobb Jövőért, later by Együtt and Harmadik Évezredert.
The guesthouse in Badacsonyt two had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, yet there was a hundred thirty guests on the invoice.
However, the fillers of prints with a rich fantasy overwhelmed it even when they put on documents the company devoted to hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in which accounting according to the information provided by the State Representative documents called Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even imagine.
The head of Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when they called him to the prosecutor and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to formality, it did not agree that according to the invoice they were staying a hundred people, they only have eleven rooms that do not have that much capacity.
In addition, food has also been listed on the invoice, while their restaurants have not been working for a long time.
The hot invoice producers were not convinced that the perceived Budapest travel agency only organizes foreign trips, and the cash payment invoice, which was also not in line with the company's invoice practice, said foolish as a service to intermediary in Hungary.
In addition, as it resulted during the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, even though the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On four documents issued by Jobb Jövőert by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o., it did not agree, inter alia, on the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25%, but 15% VAT, but were also issued by the employees of the hotel only printed invoices, but the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, "contributors" have corrupted the invoice, for example by mentioning, as a result of the investigation of the State Prosecutor, the operation of road transport of goods which the company originally founded on investment consultancy did not carry out.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Foundation of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredert and the 21st century. Chasadi Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have also been proven because of the formal deviations - the irresponsible format of the invoice and the wrong stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives deny that they would have issued invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregygaza was at the time (2001), when the group of Fiatal Városért was distributed, in liquidation, according to our information, the company's liquidating commissioner also denied that the paper would be issued.
The facts appeared consciously
The second invoicing group consists of those who knew they were to issue a fictional invoice.
The Foundation of Esély Budapestert issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredert Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The led company Collab s. r. o. accused one of the defendants to issue a fictional account.
Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners, currently in liquidation, which provided the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations by invoices worth about five million forints, with which there was no real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money because the invoices created were later penalised, which, of course, have already forgotten to include in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies belongs to those who had ties to the defendant.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was entrusted with the representative of the Ukrainian actuator Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with fuel trading and motor vehicles, with a registered office in Budapest, where the company is not found.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 immediately for the sale of computing techniques of approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, Cash Investment s.r.o., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, bought these invoices.
The manager of this company was the man from Romania who had to hand over the documents relating to the company as well as Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the associations of Atlasz, Hoppá and the foundation of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredert and himself accepted their counterfeit.
At the request of Ivana Kubat, Romanian workshops were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, none of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant because they didn't get a job.
Yet, the companies were to him, because at the request of the co-contributor of Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding leaves, issued on behalf of the company invoices to the associations of Atlasz and Y-Generáció linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, he gave Cubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Prosecutor considered that Cubatov had reached 10 percent of the amounts listed on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictional invoices, this time for the selection procedure for the Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarorszagert submitted proposals for the Public Competition of the Mihalye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a publicly beneficial socialist party organization in January 2006.
They received 500 thousand forints, but did not amount to the targets set out in the proposals.
In order to avoid this, TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found at the home tour in the office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the listing, a part of the defendants will probably describe the progress of the production of invoices, as it has already done at the Prosecutor's office.
Interestingly, it may be if it decides to reveal everything itself the main defendant Janos Zuschlag.
His testimony is not very detailed, and he has promised that he will put it all out widely, so far he has not done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, perhaps socialists have made a deal with him, and Zusi will take it on.
He could have been insulted so far, since his request to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely the placement in the house, remained unheard.
While the offenders of economic offences who have caused much more damage that have not yet been damaged, they may go freely through or at least wait for the end of the conduct in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to overestimate the goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behavior managed to reveal researchers from the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their studies, published in Science magazine, people don't want to stay in the competition of eBay auction, so they'd rather pay too much price.
The research attempted to map the diagram of this "game" in the nerve system using experimental auction.
One group of volunteers was betting, the second group participated in the played auction, with an examination of the active brain area of experimental persons using the functional method of magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, whose important element is to overtrude the other side, began to operate intensely in losing the entire under the brain cortex, called striatum.
This brain area plays a role in a "sebeplacement" of the nervous system in addition to many other functions.
According to researchers, the price is therefore possible to explain the effort to avoid a sharp reaction of striata.
In order to support their theories, members of the research team from the ranks of economists carried out a financial intersection investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups were awarded against one partner.
The control group was simply communicated to the real value of the product concerned, and they made bets.
Additionally, the members of the next group were promised that if they come out of the game winningly, they'll get a reward of $15.
The third group received $15 in the contrary before the auction, but in the event of loss, her members lost the money.
Therefore, the difference between the two groups was all set out in the fact that one was highlighted by the winning and the second loss.
However, members of the group playing "against the sin" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologs.
"This results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
They have yet explained the phenomenon that is observable in auctions with joy from victory and avoiding the risk.
Until the neurological imaging methods helped us solve the conflict between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to look for a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic infections of hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are treated, because sick people don't often know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is a summary name of infectious liver damage caused by different viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, symptomatic inflammation of the liver and the jaundice, but the agents of the disease and their diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways depending on the disease agents: hepatitis A and E digestive systems (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body fluid viruses (sperma, vascular secret, saliva).
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, against the virus of type C vaccine.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, vomiting.
Then on the skin and eye whites will create yellow, light stools and dark urine. Treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die in the world for a more serious type of disease, liver cancer and hepatic cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected medically treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to hepatic cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected about their diseases don't even know, the agent destroys liver cells abnormally, so the first symptoms occur in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, regular description is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than in average: among people who had transfusions of blood before 1991, between drug users and tattoos.
Currently, the expected global number of subjects infected with chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since the disease can prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should, in case any symptoms of unknown origin, turn to his practical doctor.
In early detection, the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body, and thus prevent contamination and prevent cancer.
30 September is the world day of hepatitis, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by the sick organisations.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its origin and the importance of early diagnosis of disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could make death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford have done an interesting experiment, they have examined how the faith in the god of perception of pain affects humans, he informed the British Telegraph journal.
In the framework of a bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electrical shock, while everyone was watching the painting showing Virgin Mary.
According to results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate a large part of the pain.
Thanks to the tech, in detail, the human brain examined showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for controlling pain.
Research is the first of the series of research that also scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university participate next to the academics.
The test was precisely carried out by attaching a sparking tool to the left of the experimental body to the left hand that gave electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to carefully observe two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary, originating in the 17th century and the Lady, with the hranol of Leonard da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the view of Virgin Mary would cause a certain condition of godliness to believers, while da Vinci's painting was chosen because it was not very different from the first and acted by their calming impressions.
Experimental entities spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time they received in four following parts of 20 electrosokes, while separately watched the image with religious or general theme.
The Catholics pointed out that when they were looking at Virgin Mary, they felt "safe," as if they were taken care of, and "have calmed down, filled them with peace."
They felt 12 percent less pain than Leonard’s work in front of them when watching a picture with a religious theme.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has also participated in research, believes that similar effect can be achieved by using any powerful image and in atheists, only the right photograph should be found.
"We would have to find a picture that will feel very positive, from a mother or father's position," said the psychologist.
English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases also changes our personality," said Wright.
After such great results, it's just a matter of what effect the faithful's pain would have to do if they showed them some madone from Leonard or a painter like a caliber.
Would it mean a view of the quality of the Virgin Mary to achieve even better results?
You're what you're going to share.
About his tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find him in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above the head; they know where they were on vacation, what they were doing in the expert examinations and what they were interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the heads of the company, that's still not enough.
However, as regards scepticals, making parallels with orwell's dark vision, these are not just the clear essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt commented recently for the Financial Times' journal that the main goal of Googlu is to gather even more personal data on users, which is necessary for the founders of Googlu to keep their original purpose, which said: "Let us arrange all the information in the world!"
According to the proprietary Googlu, the company is worth a global work after ten years only at the beginning of working with all information.
The question which will be in five years, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer the type "what should I do tomorrow?" or "What would I do?" - for such seemingly simple questions, however, the softwars will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during the search the exact search the searched words and the IP addresses have been searched and what websites the interested parties have moved after the search.
Thanks to Personalized Search started two years ago, users can, for example, preserve their history of surfing, look back what they were looking for and clicked on, thus generating in the long-term perspective findings adapted much more directly to them - on the same logic, the service of Recommendations will be based on previous and preserved preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone sees what I'm dealing with? - asks users who are afraid of the data monopoly of Googlu.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company is more dangerous, the anti-reaction does not cause guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all searched expressions are not only captured, but in justified cases may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of users of the Internet do not protect anything.
The most famous example of the past was perhaps a coordinated action against the Brazilian pedophiles during which the Brazilian government provided Google with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community pages of Orkut, created by it.
However, Internet users who are worried about personal rights could still breathe in May when the company in hand with the EFF's electronic rights organisations successfully proved its truth in dispute with the FBI: Google must not be even in the future any article forced by the Constitution to provide any information classifiedly sought by the FBI.
(In the same time, the federal government successfully fought almost 50,000 website addresses and a thousand wanted expressions, which received with appeal to strengthening the years adopted by the child protection law, but it failed to get lists of individual users' wanted items, respecting the complete lists of websites and key words covering the period of two months.)
The view on Google is so discreet: it is bided by those who are concerned about providing their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use Google services, exposed to injury, and act against him with a revolution that belongs to transnational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild cast, grouping around each other enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, it sees a new generation of largefires, "corporation that is now squeezing", unlike his rival Microsoft, considered by Windows as the conqueror of the world, as they both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by the fact that Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its application; open, free and continuously fresh source of information and the package of programs acts as much more accessible, youthier, "cooloner" than the practice of the official software defense.
However, this can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship of the Internet and personal rights that brought with them just one of the most glassiest key words of the last few years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is not about anything but cooperation, that we are deliberately leaving tracks and using the communication channels that we have available, and although their scope is different, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can have a profile right on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can be able to connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm apps, recording his listening music, then all of this can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition, he can write a blog on which his latest photogallery will appear automatically on Flickr or Picase.
At that point, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases from which it lights up: a girlfriend in the morning when looking at the flooding of photographs of common friends will easily figure out who her shady friend spent the evening with, or a company can throw away his worker only because on his blog he will reconsider his sincere opinion on top management: one is certain, the concept of private life has completely rethinked today.
Whoever lives online is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the googlian monopoly, has the possibility (because Scrooglem, who uses the Googlu search system, does not deliberately leave tracks).
A small number of people, for example, do not intend to register on community websites so that they can not be found. Online Googlu application from text editor to photoeditor and the reporting portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which will not compose the best possible profile from us.
Public opinion does not expect too secretly when Google shows teeth.
The company has its current value of $156 billion worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense's advertisements and services, which are constantly accelerated by accelerating pace, seriously disadvantages of life not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software designers.
However, critical observers also find contrappoints that make an impression: for example, the leadership has completely rejected staff protests after the double fee for the corporate preschool, any frequent daily meal of employees was too costly, but all of this was lost in addition to the fact that Google was still leaning before the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, filtering out every finding that comes to good taste, respecting the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the inner rules of the company is that it never inspires new services, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be destroyed by the world in new places: while some believe that the Googlu project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of her health system, because in it we can set up a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database, then it can serve as a good starting material for the following generations of sci-fi writers, the famous novel of Cory Doctorowa "Scroogled" describes with orwell reminiscences of the future in which it can scaryly be approached only with the help of Googlu data.
Two-fold assassin from Ozzi helped to remove two young people's tracks.
Two young people questioned the police in the case of double murder in Ozzo, according to reasonable suspicion, they helped to remove the trace of this crime, said the spokesperson of the Chief Police Directorate of the Borsod robbery.
Persons who were suspicious have suffered and are currently accused of helping the crime.
Both young people, according to MTI information, two girls are being chased freely.
Assistance of a crime is punished by the detention of freedom for up to five years.
Suspected of a double murder in Ozzo, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into interim custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a crime pre-planned multiple murders for profitable reasons.
During the investigation, a 23-year-old man owed a 53-year-old man a higher amount.
The suspect didn't want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor in the middle of last Wednesday to one establishment in Ozzo, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, a young man was prepared in advance to commit a crime, which also indicates that he committed a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapons and circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the participation of experts.
The Warsaw Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered a Warsaw Stock Exchange for buying a 100% share of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish Party, even though the Czechs had already excluded the Czech Warsaw stock exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw stock exchange is the state.
99 percent of shares are in the hands of the Polish State who wishes to sell 60 percent of securities in a few months.
As the Czech Economic Journal E15 writes, the offer of Poláków represents the highest amount offered by participants for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Börse have been offered.
The head of the Prague stock exchange Petr Koblic expressed last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all the applicants, and did not rule out that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague securities exchange is estimated by experts on stock markets to 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent, followed by the Czech Savings Office with 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of European leaves
In their Tuesday comments dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European leaves are recalled by "the second 9/11".
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, the accused Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able to settle his own side to support this fast-paid draft of the law, whose aim is to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about September 2nd.
There's also a part of the madride press that sees the guilty man in Washington.
According to El Mundo's journal, the world economy has led to the edge of collapse of the lack of political leadership there.
Dangerous collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, which will eventually pay the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress, it is a danger that Washington will not offer a political solution tool.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be overlooked, shows the female journal Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a ring of rescue and taxpayers can save them from the bankruptcy.
However, if the dominion of another bank collapses, they will no longer be enough money or other improvisation.
In a long-term perspective, Member States of the European Union should be transferred through their national egoism and united by control of the degraded financial markets.
On Monday, only more than 100 billion euros have been received by the cash institutions, recalling the Vienna Der Standard, which states that, like Americans, they will have to put deeper into their pockets and European taxpayers, more realistic.
The European Union has not been seriously involved as cunnings as an old continent.
"Safeers" may not have to weigh the hundreds of euros immediately, but it would be good if they firmly established in which case it is reasonable to touch on the money of taxpayers to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the fly of the shrimp
So what would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions if not imitation of detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
Bee, for example.
The default strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the CEATEC Japanese Fair, was introduced to engineers from Nissan Čmeláci. It was about to build a new generation of systems that prevented damages.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan constructed a biomimetic robotic control system of the type BR23C, a robotized miniate, which is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate objective of helping to create a system that can eliminate all precipitation.
"In the course of the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety cover," explains Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General for Technological R & R & D and Development.
The important role plays the complex eyes that enable bees to see in all directions in the visual angle more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers reached the idea of a laser remote.
It identifys obstacles within up to 2 meters of the BR23C in the 180 degrees visual field, calculates their distance and sends the on-board microprocessor signal, which immediately converts into an operation aiming to prevent the collision.
The transfer is captured during the fraction of the second, then the robotized car will imitate the movements of the bee and the turning of the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this extinct maneuver takes place in an instinctive way.
"If it wasn't, the robot car couldn't react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of safety packaging within which the reduction is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blinking of the eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or angled, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction that can be rotated by the wheels.
Instead of endless options offered to bees in avoidance, only the possibility of turning, acceleration and slowing was used in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, instinctive, intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, the less then the storage of data.
This mechanism must process and respond only to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need for them to be kept and reacted by intuitive logic based on dates from previous manoeuvres, therefore only a memory of a few few kilobaites is constantly used.
He doesn't need memory with giga- or megabayt capacity.
This is the first step to evolve a technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to the Nissan estimate, could get into serum cars produced within ten years.
Another possibility of application may constitute a connection of the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles, would lead the engineer to the specified final target.
Damn, dear child already has a name
The law on a package to save the economy of $700 billion, which is to be divided into a few deposits and which aims to buy bank loans, already has a written form.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended up on Saturday after midnight of the American Eastern Time, the representatives of the Congress reached the agreement in several days of the ongoing debate on the rescue package at a total value of $700 billion, told the Reuters.
"We have reached significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the Chamber of Representatives, where only the writing of the agreement is left.
The compromise on the package also supported both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said: "The program will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday 8 hours in the evening of the Washington Time (then on Monday at 2:00 a.m. on Wednesday European Time), however, no special increase on the exchanges did.
The 2008 Act on Emergency Economic Stabilisation, which the programme is to set up, will first vote on Monday, the Chamber of Representatives, and then the Senátu series.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the report on the agreement also welcomed in the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and we are very grateful for the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," said the spokesman of the White House Tony Fratto.
The programme is different from the original Bush administration proposal, in which it was intended to be spent in order to purchase unsuitable securities secured by mortgages at the same time total of $700 billion.
Now it is possible to spend in the first around half of the amount of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the case is decided by Congress on Monday's expectations, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them securities secured by mortgages, which are assessed as inequality, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will depend on the decision of the President.
The programme will be controlled by a special congregation whose member will also be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it may at the same time buy inequality loans, mortgages and securities covered by mortgages, respectively other "jed" loans.
Repurchase can take place in the framework of auctions directly, they have communicated the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for means of concern, for which companies will pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgency requirements of the US financial system up to 700 billion dollars, whether it is a large purchase of bad resources, their insurance or to prevent a systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the large cash institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The bosses of the banks that got into trouble waiting for the state to help, on the contrary, they can count on the government to reduce their distance - which is simply called the golden parachute in the overseas bacon.
They will only be reduced in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The limitation essentially means that if the Ministry purchases under the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on goldfalls if the fallen directors of the bank are not sent directly to retirement.
In the event of direct redemption of unskilled credits, the government will aggressively take action in order to ensure that money for management is not exaggerated.
It is necessary to add that the already existing golden treaties will not change, the restriction concerns only new contracts, which should be another stimulus to participate in the programme.
"One of the first case in the American history when the legal restriction on remuneration of the Directors-General will be valid," commented the President of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State will pay to banks participating in the programme the right to obtain a share, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the rescued bank build on their feet, they can also earn on this transaction.
The proposal plan includes that in the next five years the President has to submit to the Congress a proposal determining how taxpayers can be recovered from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were voices expressing doubts in relation to the plan.
"This is what American citizens did not ask us, because this dollars of taxpayers will not protect us," said the Republican Congressman of California Darrell Issa.
His democrat colleague in Ohia Mary Kaptur believes that those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street have insisted on the adoption of the provisions.

The domestic sales prices in the processing sector also slightly increased by 0,1 % compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices took place in the leather and footwear sector in August 2008 (2.8 percent), mainly due to an inter-month increase in the prices in the bedding and soldering industry by 4.6 percent, as compared to the production of footwear by 2.5 percent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemicals and products industry (1.6 percent).
The price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 percent), as well as - at the minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other industries, we measured price increases between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the production and distribution of electricity, gas and water sector, which is largely weighted by the domestic industry, prices increased by 0.3 % in August, especially by an ongoing impact of the officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in each processing sector, prices increased most in the oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the co-working sector, 13,2 % could be observed, in the field of food products, beverages and tobacco products having a decisive weight and 11 % price increase.
The price reductions were made in textiles and textile products sectors (2.5 percent) and the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 percent).
In other industries, the price growth rate was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.

Next year, no visas to the United States?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a great hope that, around 12 January, the agreement on visa-free relations will enter into force, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "now it's almost all that matters, if an electronic road authorisation system is built on time beyond the sea, respectful controls."
At the same time, she noted that part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy has been conducting negotiations in Washington since today.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleeezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order for the merits of the Republic of Hungary and will conduct interviews with advisers of the foreign policy of the President of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, both large American candidates, assured their support for government bank rescue package worth $700 billion on Sunday, but they are also politicians who demand the demissary of the Minister of Finance.
After several days, the Congress and Administrative Representatives have been announced on Sunday morning: the basic agreement was concluded on the bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to retaliate the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, became the central issue of the president's campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistently referring to the most appropriate of both candidates that would lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys at the same time as they got into the forefront of economic questions, Obama gained a certain advantage again and the McCain's lead went away, which was secured by Sarah Palin's Republican nomination at the vice president's post.
Obama expressed on Sunday at the pre-election meeting in Detroit the hope that the law on the package will be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which also supports.
"We have to act now, responsiblely... to your places, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the economy is at risk," said 35,000 crowds ago.
You didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain the ideas of the economy outdated.
McCain explained in the interview provided by the ABC television station: "It's going to be a little bit more... but nothing to do is simply not a way."
As the Republican Senator said, the proposal sets out the establishment of a Commission supervising the Minister of Finance and the limitations of the withdrawal for the Supreme Representatives on which he insisted.
Obama for the CBS station declared that McCain had no more important role in the negotiations, he himself was in everyday contact with the minister.
The President of the Chamber of Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the proposal of the law on Monday.
Overview of the printing of the German Language Area
The right camp is unhappy, but only voters inside it became more confident - so it analyzes the weak outcome of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter takes part in his article entitled "Bavarian Revolution eats his father" causes of dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a known politologist, the CSU erosion started a lot before his office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
However, changing the season is the problem of the whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not quite surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday, the process that could be assumed almost ten years: the inconsistent hegemonia of one Stateside ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time under 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, i.e. in so often reminiscent of the Stoiber period.
The cause is the modernization that the CSU has done in this country consistently and eaten by her parents.
Sociologists have foretold it for 40 years, but at a pace they were very mistaken. Secularization, educational results, deployment of the Germans from the east and from the north in the emerging Bavaria regions, however, could not have been without prejudice to the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right camp is indestructible, but only voters inside him have become more confident, more critical, more self-esteemed.
It is also clear that in recent weeks CSU was the most remote of classic civil layers; people in free profession, businessmen, adults with graduation and higher education.
That's how CSU's support has been swarming under 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Log deals with the confusion in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The Chairpersons are detaining in the questions of the coalition" in the context of the confusion of the intrapolitical situation caused by the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP shall prohibit the entry of SPÖ into its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, greeners are still not interested in coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything is rolling around the coalition; in the debate held in public television, the chairmen of the parties have not been able to look at their cards.
Chairman SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to deal with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some of the social countries and there is a way in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as vice-cancler, left Faymann open.
As he said, Schüssel-Molterer was voted for each fall.
Repetition of this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann attempts to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition, or enters the coalition, it is so far completely open, these questions must be discussed definitely within the ÖVP.
President BZÖ Jörg Haider has again appeared open to all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility," said Haider.
Jaroková: A broken circle of poverty and segregation should be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Equality Summit, which is hosting France, the current President of the European Union.
Lívia Jaróková, Ms. European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of professional producing in its message addressed by the plenary addressed attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
In order to draw up a meeting between the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations to protect rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press offices of the european movements, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of labour, the Roma are expelled from the European labour market mainly by blame for their low education.
"The majority of young Roma have no secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of primary education, only a minor part of them can achieve a higher degree of education."
Jaróková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Romani children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, consciousness of these relationships is needed in the widest circles - between Romani and non-Romanian children.
The sooner the Roma student begins school, the greater the chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes contribute to the national budget.
"Roms are the right of their state citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and guarantee the removal of their unfair and separate education," raised Lvia Jaróková.
According to the Member State, coherence of the European Union is essential with the emphasis on the objective and negotiations in order to immediately accelerate the processes of degregation of schools, which is primarily important to ensure proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discriminatory regulations.
"The enormous circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment should be broken, it is necessary to provide Romani children with the possibilities given by the democratic space so that they can participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," said Jaróková.
The European Year of Equal Opportunities is guaranteed by the European Summit of Equal Opportunities, organised every year since the last Berlin meeting, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the goals of equality and to eliminate discrimination, set at the level of Europe and the individual Member States.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of serving dua Huber-Beckstein will decide by the end of October
Despite the miserable election debacle, the debate on personal questions has not yet been deferred.
President of the Party Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their positions, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, decides the extraordinary congress of the party on the last October weekend.
In any case, the members of a very criticized dua were told that they would not be able to rely on their posts.
They tried to calm the angry members of the fractions and bases, which, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "basic cums" causing personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, still under the leadership of Edmunda Stoiber at the top of the career - has gained 60.7 percent of the Christian and social union, now, a year after a puk against Stoiber, but her forces were only 43.4 percent.
CSU has been in Bavaria producing 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years.
While conservatives in the Southern Federal Country have a key importance for the Hungarian economy, a high position, in any event, will be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first characters of reorganisation within the party is that a member of the close intelligence team that will initiate the prosecution negotiations on the possible coalition of the Munich Government with the liberal FDP, respecting the right-oriented grouping of Free voters, will also be the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be the possible successor of Huber.
It is the irony of fate that the candidate of the Free elections received Gabriel Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber used duo Huber-Beckstein to perform a rift, but then with ambitious municipal politician, they made a miserable process.
CSU leaders now focus all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, the active role will also be paid to Stoiber, who has yet to place strings from the back, former premiere of Earth, and former president of the CSU called the 28th September the most harsh day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber poured several driving notes to the CDU address, and he believes they would deserve much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a Chancellor if the CSU, who played a significant role in national success in 2005, will somehow not build on her feet.
According to Merkel, which has been hard to hide her disappointment, the loss of CSU's position will not have a negative impact on Berlin's great coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of social democratics continues.
The SPD has reached the 18,6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Lukašenko:Opposition - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, neither of the opposition Member got to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained by the Russian observers by the well-being and stability of the country ruled by Alexandr Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) by the illegalities that occurred when the votes were read.
The OSCE sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although the 110-member legislative congregation of the 10 million countries lacked the opposition for ten years, the opposition associated under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before last elections had a serious hope that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of a change in the constitution in elections with discreet course in 2006 and the fourth renewal of his presidential mandate, this time "lets" appear in the Parliament to several opposition Members.
The ODS has dropped that from the formerly considered battlecott.
In the background of the opposition expectation, it was that the economically more dependent Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the continuously irritating Russian imports of natural gas, had taken credit and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines passing through the country, would like to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to Belarus, the political establishment assessed as anti-democratic Lukashnko and other high positions of politicians, do not receive input permits.
In early release, the OSCE pointed to emphasise the positive shifts, and not the deficiencies - for example the ban on candidates for third opposition candidates.
However, the Monday lightning report of the OBSE has already had reservations on the campaign during which opposition candidates could not, in principle, appear in the press, in particular, that the opposition cannot be present in the conclusion of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released on freedom and Minsk is willing to go with Moscow and to a smaller confrontation when he refuses to accept from Georgia the detached South Osetia and Abchazia, even though Russia, with whom Belarus is formed on the Union's paper, considers this two territories independent for a month.
"We made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU started," said Alexander Milinkevič.
According to the opposition candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable for it to remain, even though "it was too reluctant to let a single member of the opposition into an irrelevant parliament."
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, the opposition leaves must be printed in Russia, distributing the obstacles of local authorities, but I see that the change supports more and more people, even among the elders," said Milinkevič, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers its greatest success to create social security, does not consider the right or officially supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's debt and business deficit growth, it's only a matter of time when social security 'inviting silence of cemetery' collapses," judges Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian opposition observers valued the election as democratic.
The Head of the Community Mission of independent states of Sergei Lebedie in the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti said that "people do not believe words, but acts", so the absence of the opposition is nothing other than evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, the turning doors were introduced when the employees were coming and leaving.
However, from now on, this new measure will start against the lubricated people, against those who fuck and then go to coffee at work.
The newspaper against the lenochs was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renate Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the President's Council of Maur Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta – are a tool for better work, higher performance, more gifts and more services" explains the Minister.
"The new period of responsibility and transparency is now open.
This is reformism," stresses Brunetta.
By the palace of Chigi, we will complete the introduction of the Council's Presidency in all buildings.
Masi's "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the staff, assures the secretary-general: "It was a common procedure with all workers and cooperation."
In short, no more breakfast at work; no coffee and croissant anymore.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Training School for Public Administration
In Rome, the Minister will ultimately announce that the absence of public staff for diseases has decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 people more per year at work."
And he will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"his payout dynamics – explains the Minister – has doubled over the last 8-10 years with regard to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage".
Meanwhile, thousands of public staff have come together to reject Brunett's decree standards in accordance with the request supported by Codacons.
"As long as the Minister for Public Administration today presents a number of ciphers regarding lower absence in work for diseases – writes consumer protection associations – the nation of 'pile lemons' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have gathered themselves to declare war on illegal standards contained in the decree."
Tara will be protested primarily against the exclusion of sickness surcharges which depend on activities; the extension of the period in which the sick person can be checked in which time limits the inspection visits will be carried out and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute Prevention"
Every day, there are 2.500 accidents in Italy, three people die, and twenty seven will remain permanently invalid.
Inail's values confirm that in 2007 we have about 1.200 deaths as a result of accidents at work.
These values testify to the seriousness of the case, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice death compared to murders.
In order to reinvite the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates today in all the Italian regions 58. national day of the victims of accidents provided for on the second Sunday in October.
"A worrying data extended to Anmile and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of labour safety is", confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Murdered and Disability for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its vivid admiration for continuous joint efforts to ensure safety at work, the protection of wounded workers, the assistance of victims families and the participation of the public opinion."
"Of course, an angry 'dust' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedy, which induce the media's range of distress and public opinion, but everyday reality offers us dramatic cases again, even recurring in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not conceive that "the problem of resources is undoubtedly exist: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The number of initiatives promoted in the field of education are particularly important, so that young people facing the world of work can gain clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed on his part, "as death resulted in an accident of work, it creates an absolutely critical social condition as it insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make persuasive efforts to stop this state."
"As regards the data of accidents, it seems to have shown a certain positive turnover, but it does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of the accident work is as alarming," said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We wouldn't just want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because just when the attention stops, the tragedy will explode.
"We believe that it is generally done too little to stop the injury problem and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion - to point out Mercandelli – to increase control and inspection, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion.
However, there is a greater sense of responsibility by employers to the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli finally declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the right level for the damages envisaged for the work victims and "resuance of supportive care" to which the system has been reached in recent years.
"The purpose is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker – he added – because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneousness or giving time from time to time the legislator."
Players of Mp3 accused, presenting a risk of hearing
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable musical instruments as a Mp3 player can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's publication of the European Commission's notice, which, in one official report extended in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks which have recently emerged and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"In this scientific view, we read in notes – it shows that 5-10% of those who have been listening to music for at least five years using portable musical instruments, weekly more than an hour and maintaining a high volume device, risking a permanent loss of hearing skills."
"I am concerned that so many young people who use often portable musical devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously harm their hearing in an unrepairable way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings – continue to lead – there is a clear risk and needs to be reacted quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to stimulate consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to become completely effective and to keep a step with new technologies."
Brussels requested an independent scientific committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"The successors – closed the executive Eu official – confirm that it is necessary to be concerned and now the European Commission will examine together with the other members and parties that raised the problem, what measures could possibly be introduced and so better to protect children and young people from displaying noise, the originator of which are portable musical instruments and similar devices."
At present, there is already a security European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are concerns about hearing damage which can be caused by an excess exposure to similar forms of noise.
These damages can be very limited by looking for solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the current limits corresponding to maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of the users of such devices and their quantities can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will leave free progress to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the staff of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome" that met in its new seat at the Caracall spa this morning.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will set up instructions for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the Council will evaluate analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and his councilman Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and is included in all political, social and cultural ideas – he wants to emphasise Alemanno – he will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually use political decision-makers to remain Giunta e General Council.
It's not about any exchange of functions, but only trying to have a place to process a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved because this institution must have a precise timeline.
In June – he announces the mayor – we will present a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has carried out for the future of Rome's capital."
Whoever accuses the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanna will say: "It is all up to the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are quality, as well as the Commission's proposals, and I am confident in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, the policy will fall to everyday problems and the urgency that will occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look for longer and further, in deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, Mayor Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a useless business nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not stand even the euro and serve to think and involve the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, essentially, "we need to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definite nor inevitable to allow our city to have an authentic rise at the level that he essentially needs, and to think of a united spirit on his future."
The future, which, specifys the Mayor of Rome "will not limit only to the current local borders, but will look far further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its statute of the capital, but will "take the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
One famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decipherded the US economy by his decisions and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks against Obama are growing just as soon as the election's date is coming.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama has a rudeness: he thinks he's going to get to the highest position of the nation, who has all of them two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks do not say much; they are attacks clearly of race origin and do not respond to the question of voters: he will be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says that Obama will win and with a great start.
Even in this case, there are those who act by their hearts and not by their brains.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election booth, we know who will give his voice to the American patriot.
One page of the American mentality that has remained vibrant until the last moment.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of who to check on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama had to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been pronounced before seem to almost a certain success of a black candidate.
But despite all these thoughts for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: what mistakes did Bush made during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent responded: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers saved their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq became for most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever goes to George W's place will have to do a huge task.
The U.S. economic collisions were felt by journalists: in the newspaper there is an investigation period, and many accuse the Internet, "killer" printvine.
PEW Research Center has been questioned by five hundred journalists on the state of their profession and assumptions regarding the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questioning has not been openly told that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem is money for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of the 2008 economic model is the crisis.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the paper together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved, if we do not want traditional Journalism as much as the wide public understands it, to change.
The American journalist passes through clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten journalists in printing and executive seniors are convinced that a journalist on a national scale is taking the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the website goes.
Bigger publishing is taking a way to the internet, which many look at as "killer" prints.
"Economic pressure" on which journalists pointed up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists asked admitted that they were revoking to technology in the hope that they would do something good for their newspaper.
The biggest proliferation in American journalists is among those who run newsrooms – that means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are certain that their reporters share their values while at local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something to do with a job's security.
The leaders who think they're gonna lose a job over three years are 47% at national level.
As for journalists, they're moving to 30%.
With regard to "sure work" regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still in order daily.
Only 13% of the journalists work on the contract.
In such an enormous nation as Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and internet employers often offer what they want, and so take them or leave them.
The managers receive almost always huge salaries, and the editor can make even $10,000 a month away from paying a pension and insurance.
As regards holidays, the argumentation is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, are often ill during one year.
It's only a climate issue.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN THE RUSSION, DANILO COPPOLA REPUBLIC IN GROTTAFERRATIA
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse to lodge a businessman with the real estates of Daniel Coppoly, who asked him to move himself from his city, Grottaferrata, to the apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-dose selling of Unipol-Bnl.
During his own costs process, he got released from a home prison last week, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the businessman with real estates could change the place of residence from the rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this recession (as opposed to which he expressed) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence they blame him.
Elities in danger
This phenomenon was shown a few days ago when the Comora of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a large part of the Americans was more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times last night, which informs us that the current crisis is breaking down the Republican side, constantly more divided between its old soul East Coast, milder, inclined to federal institutions and business community, and to its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to the "th Washington" and to the world of finance, strong primarily in the middle and south states..
The soul that arrogantly expressed itself by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this cited thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows : not only in the United States but throughout the west and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, it seems that this crisis works as an accelerator of phenomena, which have been incubated for a long time in the new climate, which is finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-up, exceptional market recovery, the double category of State-power in relation to a certain re-environment of economics.
The crisis is indeed the crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but in which they are mainly included in the greatest extent of the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
Which also created a political problem for those who manage it: that means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families that are among others voters.
In short, the crisis seems economically worldly, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the game or that it has nothing to add: the obvious evidence has given the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide for one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each State, the rescue plans, the recovery of the market, the new rules and mainly the breakdown of the funds: only states have economic resources, the amount of resources, so that they can try to make things right.
It also owns the necessary means and authorisations to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances which may not have any market and no international organisations will ever have to have to a similar extent.
This new emphase that the crisis puts on a state-national element is also in full coherence with the increasing significance that is attempting to bring final economic progress to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we entered the kingdom of the net, still more sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finances were already predetermined to rule the world, we realized, of all of all, that our future would have to have to deal with so little non-material things such as water, grain, naphtha.
All things that would say can be transported from one place to another, but in any case they are linked, absolutely, to the bordered area, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler, he certainly has a lot more cards in his sleeve than who isn't, and who has bad luck living in a place without grain, no oil and no water.
I get to the second news, but it predicts a break.
Whoever speaks of the territory, the state, the government, inevitably speaks of politics, i.e. leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, two convergence phenomenons appear to be created.
On the one hand, consciousness that authority leadership is objectively needed, a request for someone who can deal with the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of discreditation against existing leadership, especially economical, which has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And, together, something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discreditation, impatience, inability and absence, trying to control the entire government class in more Western countries.
It seems that it is increasingly expanding in the wider masses of the population to believe than to make their actions the same as the thoughts of the so far popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the real sense, that elite has already exceeded its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The requirement for leadership is simply feeding one branch from the underground, but a strong movement for the removal of government class and traditional political arrangement is manifested in the uneven electoral "bounds" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and last time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American Congressman against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their sides, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasing problems to understand, which is to represent, which, not from now on, is formed in deep layers of Western companies and that the economic crisis reinforces, expands, potentially overlaps.
Before that, it would be exaggerated to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion"».
But I'm sure we can't say that it means having a really open eye.
Super glue to walk on walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres and now the team of four institutes has approached him very much.
Scientists managed to keep the stokilogram body sticked on the vertical wall with a sticker of just 2.5 cm squared.
STUDIUM – American Journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research.
The material that invented a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a specific carbon structure, which is called carbon dwarf tube.
«We can imagine the glue as a series of pipes placed as a organized band of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists inspired the legs of gecko, covered with microscopic hops, which enable the animal to ensure a perfect helmet.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these plagues and at the same time"is simply detached from the wall» explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton.
HEALTH? - "This material could be useful as a provizor adhesive» adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers think of far less fascinating use as the connection of electric devices, because the coal pipes are the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could concern air space engineering .
For now, no super heroes.
OTHER EXPENDITURE – Also the University of Berkley, California, is involved in research of new adhesives.
In one article, the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists presented a glue formed from micro fibers as hair that cleans themselves from dust to surface to keep perfect urgency.
Medicines: Never with juice
Watch out for grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed primarily in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, their eating changes in strengthening or reducing effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario in London, emphasizes the risks of juices both finished and fresh in combination with the consumption of certain medicines, at the 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new alarm: just one glass of grep, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, to cancel their useful effects and risk health of patients.
Grep juice has already been accused of increasing the toxic level of effects of certain antiarithmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolitics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
LEKS IN RIZIKU– It was announced by the Italian Medical Agency in the information bulletin two years ago and burned out doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink in the event of taking medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEJEN GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice contain substances that suppress the drugs.
Long list of effects of silent grapefruit and other juice.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmaceutical department of the State University in Milan: "These discoveries are mostly immediately reported to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that eventually arrange and replace information instructions.
So always read illustrative lists of medicines you get and if you find something unclear, do not worry, but ask a doctor or pharmacist to clarify» stressed the expert for Ansa.
Nobel for the economics of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was assigned to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of commercial models and location of economic activity.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of Bush's administration.
Several months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days when Enron broke, Krugman foretold in one comment published in New York Times that the second event would be much more important than the first, as a result of the history of the United States.
Forecast, which caused a low polemek, which has been recounted for years, but it has proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked, with the speed of collaboration such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "econom of great importance", but also a popularizer who has a great aggressive style, especially critical against Bush's excesses liberalist administration».
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of issue of Open Office.org 3.0, the open source package of personal production, which aims to penetrate increasingly more users from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative known by Microsoft Office.
After about an annual work of volunteer workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows a wide public with various news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window, another, far more important, as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and to support the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last standard ISO version.
It is also important to cooperate with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a document and a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows to reduce the PowerPoint presentation dimensions, useful for example for transmission of electronic routes, or the possibility to transfer PDF folder to the graphic design model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create documents "PDF hybrids", which are similar to the typical Adobe graphics format and have the properties of the table processor or text program.
Cooperation is a element that has gained many improvements within application programmes: in excellence it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, each collaborator is assigned one color to comment to make it clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies also work to transfer some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should rebuild the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, was added to the English version on the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for an operational Linux system.
Also the installation cd can be sent home or at the workplace at request.
And if the topic of freeness can be a topic to expand in households, just on the Open Office business area a lot of stakes, and it can already count on the various projects implemented in the public administration and in schools.
And neither does the offer of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentation like Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous access, is a program that allows to work on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are nearly 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this foreseen number can be overcome.
Also the results of the Kohla are positive, it's the fourth doping case
The new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is Rakušana Bernhard Kohla, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and the winner of the best top top winner T-shirt.
The report quoted the pages of the journal L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive on Cera, Epo third generation, after itales Riccard Riccco and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the Kohla blood samples fall into those carried out in the last few weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Cera, Rakušan will lose a third place for Tour and will have to face the determined two years of discharging.
The report on Kohla's pozitivity at the third generation of Epo confirms the head of the French antidoping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed of the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26-year-old Rakusan was placed on the stage winners behind Spain Carlos Sastr and American Cadel Evansem, also won a punted top top top shirt.
IMGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES HERE, Is ITALIA RASIST?
Italy "as a country of migrants only changed to the priority target of immigrants" adopted with resistance in the last house.
This is how the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of cookies.
This case shows what New York Times defines "paradox north": the northern regions are simultaneously those where "more integration and more work is registered", but also "the strongest anti-emigration ideas in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to halt immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is quoted as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
The tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after he met Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked that he stand and the church work together on the defeat of racism."
Students with the victims of expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The lease market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to Sunia's recent research, the tenant unions, rent a single room, a student can stand up to 900 euro in Milan, Florence 700, Neapoli 650, Rome 600.
"Jew has already reached such dimensions that the entire layer of students have lost the right to study because of the overall high prices that their families would have to bear – explains the head of the Sunia studio, Laura Mariani – in this city the large demand from students has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the price increase that has grown to residents."
In most cases, rent offers include several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without a limited rental, associated hires.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed, which, thanks to the tax revision, could regulate prices.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 ( Bande Nere zone) over a medium value of 800 (the Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed stands in the average of 350/400 euros, one room of about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We save only if we move to periphery areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room of the Prenestina, Centocelle zones, and similarly.
In Neapoli there is 300/450 euros for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polilinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impacts on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rented for students from countries outside the European Union, one additional anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students compared to Italian students.
Farewell to the old Cinema Paradiso, the city cancels the historical halls
The cinematographic historical halls are closed for the benefit of Multiplex.
"The place without a cinema is like blind is like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by director Giusepp Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian centers, but also rural cities.
The process of cinema restriction, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent outbreak of monosals in the central city zones is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a true cultural crime.
It's often disappearing historical places loaded with memories," it's like we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of the journey and a lot of emotions», the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great prize of the jury in Cannes, and who told the poetry of one village cinema and sadness for the way of life that probably lost forever.
The values acquired by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years the door closed 316 kin of the traditional tip, and the highest account paid the halls mainly in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Neapoli, Bolonia and Rome, 6 less in Torina, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions, Emilia-Romagna is first with the loss of 82 cinema halls followed by Toskansko (44) and Lombardií (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multisals: by 195 plaque more in Lombardia in the last five years, by 81 both in Toskania and in Emilia-Romagna.
“Italian procedure has evolved unracionally” says Paolo Protti, President of Anecu,” it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that they will survive, because when one cinema in the city is closed, not all of his visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about a lack of funding for the fund for operators: the previous state debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
In support of the sector, it would be necessary between €16 and €18 million per year».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city, which is concerned about closures and which decided to find the exit by signing the protocol between the municipalities and Aneco, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the standards planned are tax relief steps for operators and advantages for the audience with regard to mobility: viewers will be able to go into the zone with a limited transport and will have special prices to stop and at certain parking areas.
“I like this initiative” says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures”.
However, it is certain that the traditional halls must improve sound quality and image quality because today's audience is more demanding.
Defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to start "New Cinema Paradiso", which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been walking before the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotions so that I don't have to look at the writings of black dust, I will turn to the other side».
The link between politics and the Mafia group 'ndranghet, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The Mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the city's office according to the interests of Mafia's Piromalli Group."
The charges against the Mafia in Kalábria against the mayor and vice-starost Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarn Carl Martelli, trapped this morning because of external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are hard.
In the limbs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between clan and public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, a chief nominee, already accused of committing mafia's crimes of character, sentenced to pay €10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards as well as sound sense," writes the state attorneys when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay consult to the lawyer Piromalli.
"So the Mafia Group would allow – writes the judges – officially entering the city offices and make it easier for them to control and manage public administrations."
The president of the California Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not conceive that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime underworld are many: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndranghets, heroes, who are still invincible'.
The imprisonment from this morning followed by the imprisonment of July last year by which the police showed that the Mafia group of Piromalls had been ultimately hit.
Since the end of April last year, the city council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, and the reason for the link between organised crime and local administration was the reason for which local politicians were disposed of functions in the general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrion, the chairman of Christian Democrats, who was elected the head of the coalition of the right center after a closer election in May.
He screamed for a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the council to dissolve.
He called for the responsibility of the former Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him that he had taken everything for political reasons, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that the Mafia group had grown even so far that he had asked for the change of the A3 motorway project.
From further interviews directed against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors writes out, "a willingness to move the claims of entrepreneurs, representatives of a larger group very close, as generally known, Piromallim and adapt the choices of public administration to the Mafia Group's interests."
When the energy is born from the waves, they enter the game with the big ones.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the Earth surface and now begins to discover the world's great energy society.
The waves, currents, tide, the odliv are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the vision of colossians such as Chevron, who are now trying to draw hands on these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 70s, research has increased intensified in relation to the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil decreased around 1980, the idea of using sea energy went aside, but now the ecological organization and the new oil price increase gave the sector a new impulse.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that around 15 percent of the world consumption of electricity could be covered by the use of sea wave movements.
This amount would be twice the energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
Plus, there are currents and tides and spits.
Giants attack.
Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in North Portugal, was the company that put up a plant in sea energy.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more companies are more than traditionally based on sea energy.
"Chevron is studying the energy technologies of the oceans – expressing the speaker of one company, which is connected to the oil cycle of the United States, in the economic daily newspapers Wall Street Journal – and thinking about the possibility to cooperate with us".
The cooperation we are considering concerns the acquisition of a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project for the use of sea energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that in the United States Alaska it continues to grow oil and recently President Bush came up with a new drilling plan.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc is watching a trace of marine energy and Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested sums, even though they are not in detail known, show an increasing interest according to observers.
Technologies, we need to work together.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in the beginning, because they don't know what impact the marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, the establishments in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, technology must be used with a greater impact on management.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fear that is connected between each other.
The strength of waves that move with the buoys up and down is changed by the help of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure within these fights.
The pressure melts the turbine that delivers the energy to the generator.
The energy gets to the shore of submarine cables.
For the time being, there are four projects of this type, which are only waiting for federal approval and a part of energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power already produces energy for the shopping centre and parking by using six pdmarine turbines in the New York East River.
The flow of water during the flow and deflection causes the turning of turbines, which by this rotating movement of the live generator.
Verdant expressed that they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation for the possibility of using this energy.
After waves, tide and spill.
At this point, they deserve the potential of inflow and drain, they call in the Institute for Energy Research.
Although it is an independent factor, the tide and the drain are more predictable than the wind, the sun or waves, and the fall even more reliable as the source of energy.
Just into the energy of the flow and deflection of the states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coastal states already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
