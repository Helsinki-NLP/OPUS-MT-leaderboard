It's kind of a cat.
It's an exciting city, New York.
It's a pity you can't travel with us.
It's a pity you can't join us.
It's a privilege to meet you.
It's better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
It's clear that he's at home.
It's Friday.
It's getting bigger.
It's getting dark outdoors.

It's surprising that they should have a second house in America.
It's time for you to go to bed.
It's too late for him.
It's too late for you.
It's true that I'm a strict teacher.
It is true that the earth is round.

It's been ages since we last met.
It's been a while since I told you I love you.
