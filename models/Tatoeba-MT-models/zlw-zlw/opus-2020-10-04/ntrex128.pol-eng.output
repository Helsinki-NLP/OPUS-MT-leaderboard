Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear that they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, there has been a consternation. This is the effect of the proposal to amend their title at the members of the Wales of Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, in a short MWP).
The idea was based on the plans for the conversion of the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
The members of the assembly from all sides of the political stage are concerned that they can become the subject of clips.
One of the parliamentarians from the Labour Party expressed the concerns of his grouping, saying that the new name is rhyming with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For non-Walle readers: in the Welsh language the word "twp" means a fool, and the word "pwp" – leaves.
One of the politicians of the party Plaid Cymru said that its grouping was “unsatisfactory” of the proposals and presented other solutions.
However, he pointed out that the word “MWP” was very close to the word “muppet”.
In this case, the Welsh letter "in" is similar to the letter "u" in the English dialect Yorkshire.
As part of the assembly, the committee currently working on a draft Act amending the name took the following position: “The most recent decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to them themselves.”
The law of the Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave Wales the National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal.
In addition, the committee endorsed the proposal for a change in the title of the members of the Meeting on the "Member of the Wales of Parliament", namely the WMP in English, although the "MWP" has enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
The members of the assembly propose alternative solutions. The difficulty in achieving the consensus is a loss for Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, which should present the bill in the next few weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes in the work of the assembly, including the principle of revoking members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their next title when discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of country name
The voters will soon decide whether their country will soon be named North Macedonia.
The public vote is intended to help discontinue a few decades of disputes with the neighbouring Greece, in which the region called Macedonia is located.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed the attempts to join the state in the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanow, President of Macedonia and the opponent of the referendum on the change of the name said that he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, plebism supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells in the New York Milky Church of St. Marcin in Harlem’s troubles
“ The older people I'm talking to say that there was a bar and a church on each corner earlier, ” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them now."
As he says, the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“ Currently, people are giving themselves socially in a different way,” he observed.
"The bars have ceased to be the place of regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, it is concerned that the assets from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as decision-makers think, and that “the sooner or later will be at the starting point”.
He added that churches can be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who will not support other surrounding holidays.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be a white race, and this will speed up the complete closure of the churches, because it is unlikely that new residents become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by the congregation of white faithfuls before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the Church of St. Marcin joined the community decade later).
The original assembly of white metodists left the district in the 1930s.
The Afro-American congregation took over the right of property to the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by the assembly under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the fighters against the 125th Street (main trading street in Harlem), opposing the employment or promotion of African Americans.
The fire in 1939 has significantly damaged the building, but the parish of John Howard Johnson has made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of the bell team.
Reverend David Johnson, John Howard Johnson's son, and his successor in St. Marcin's church, proudly called the new carilion of the poor bells.
The expert who blew in the bells in July described it in a different way, such as the “cultural treasure” and “the unreplaced historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world operated by a black musician. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin's church did not replace him.
In recent months, in St. Marcin's church, there have been a number of complex events involving architects and performers, and some of them have brought the shining leaders of the church, and some — the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (management body of the parish leaders) directed its concerns to the diocese, saying that “she wants to transfer costs to the Council”, although the Council did not participate in the employment of architects and performers sent to place.
A part of the parish also complains of lack of transparency on the side of the diecese.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California
The authorities told me that last Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old diver in the search of lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the U.S. town of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he dived with his friends when he heard the cry for help. They immediately flew to the boy to help get him out of the water.
At first, as Hammel said, he thought the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
After reaching the event site, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely scattered skin in the area of the collar.
“I started yelling to everyone to escape from the water: “There is a shark in the water!” — he added Hammel.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to a childhood hospital of the Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that the fish was seen a few weeks earlier, but it was considered that it is not a kind of dangerous shark.
Larry Giles added that the victim had severe damage to the upper body.
In order to carry out an investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noticed that more than 135 species of sharks are living in the area, although most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand business on the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's network throws gloves to shops like Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetic departments in their supermarkets related to the style of trade houses, as well as specially trained vendors.
Within a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow despite the declines in the fashion industry and household articles, there will be more cosmetic products in 11 stores in the network. In the event of success of the next year, the action will be extended to the next points.
Return to the cosmetic industry is due to the search for ways of managing the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network doubles the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3,000 articles. For the first time, there will be goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold articles of brand L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more places and separate areas close to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most articles will be friendly for vegans, which are increasingly demanding young customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second rise in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, in the later period of the year.
The widespreadness of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops makes supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, President of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly remind the goods houses, because the network is trying to fight discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's placed points of the Argos network in hundreds of shops and introduces a number of Habitat network points since both companies were taken two years ago. According to the company, this helps to increase the sale of food products and increase the profitability of investment.
The previous attempt to reorganize departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals has failed.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots to test. However, cooperation was completed following a conflict of income sharing from pharmaceuticals operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy after selling 281 pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds' reports, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended offer of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Commercial Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics departments in order to improve customer impressions.
We have invested in special training for collaborators so that they can help consumers in shopping.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and a friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to pay attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way to buy."
Peter Jones "an angry" after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby with a contract worth £11 million
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den TV program, was "an angry" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the worthy of 11 million pounds of lifestyle brand to focus on re-established cooperation with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles under the name of Truly.
The activities were often compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
A sudden decision to leave a well-being lifestyle brand and focus on re-established cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taken by Holly Willoughby, was angry with Peter Jones, the Dragons' Day star.
As the source reports, Peter Jones was "an angry" when a popular TV presenter reported during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his Marlow business empire, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts of up to 1.5 million pounds will not have time to sacrifice their brands offering accessories and articles of Truly's household.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop. She also had to double Holly Willoughby's assets estimated at 11 million pounds.
After the announcement of the decision to leave Truly brand by the 37-year-old Holly Willoughby at Instagram Peter Jones left the Great Britain, going to one of his summer homes.
According to the source, “Marka Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She was with her future and wanted to take care of her for several decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business has completely surprised all involved persons.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In the Marlow Warehouse, the goods are ready to sell."
Experts believe that the resignation of this Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investment in products, including articles from candles to clothing and household articles, and will lead to further delays in entry into the market.
It may also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin held close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp set up Truly in 2016 and the 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March at the position of the President.
The couples spent their vacation together, and Jones included 40% of the shares in the TV company belonging to Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to be M&S Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
The source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A hard conversation, “and then we fell in love with each other”
The president was joking about the criticism of the media due to the attention made by some of them as a "unsatisfactory husband" as well as a positive relationship with the North Korea leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a laughing voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trump with a great step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are delayed.
After more than three months from the June summit in Singapore, the Head of North Korean diplomacy Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that he does not see an "analogical response" from the United States for early actions of North Korea to disarma.
He noticed that instead the United States maintained sanctions and pressures.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing great with North Korea, ” he said.
“We had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have suffered death.
Now we keep a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Dzong Unem brought positive results: they led to the end of rocket trials, helped to release the hostages and return to the rest of the US soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Dzong Unem.
“It is easy to behave in the presidential way. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium we would have 200 people here,” Trump said, showing the finger of the crowd gathered directly in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lomboku, the authorities have not announced a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international assistance.
“In many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbung.
Although the organization Save the Children prepares for travel to the Indonesian Palu city, it is not sure that international staff can operate at the site of the event.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Ombudsman of the National Agency for Natural Disaster, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to see if assistance from international organisations should be allowed.
In view of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to combat the forces of nature.
Although in the province of Aceh, shelters were built in case of tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of siren warning against tsunami in Palu – despite warning – probably had an impact on the number of death victims.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
The natural flakes make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, is heading to help the victims of the earthquake to Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the target.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and has spent a lot of funds on roads and rail lines.
However, in the face of future elections, the President's administration faces the lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was stressed because of the persistent tension of religious grounds in the country. The members of the majority of the Muslim community accepted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands of inhabitants lost their head roof as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machete, arches, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge wins a draw gate in the Chelsea game

Cromwell’s monument before the British Parliament, the last victim in the event of “write history again”
The removal of the monument would bring justice for reminiscing the activities of the Taliban to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, purite supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "craziness" and "I'm going to try to write history again."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “According to the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute about the character of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The paintings during the English domestic wars were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps his ancestor Thomas was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on a memorial indicates what the opinion of this politician in the 19th century was and that for many people it is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview for The Sunday Telegraph: “With many Cromwell was perceived, perhaps more often in the 19th century than today, for defending Parliament from external pressures. In this case, it was, of course, a monarchy.
The assessment of how accurate this statement is, is subject to a continuous historical debate.
It is true that the conflict of the mid-18th century has shaped further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an appreciable character identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to celebrate and commemorate."
In China there was a fatal slaughter of a farmer by a pig
As local media reports, there was a fatal swine attack on a farmer at the fair in the southwestern part of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloody and with a cut artery near the pighouse in Liupanshui, in the province of Kuejczo.
The pig breeder is preparing for vaccination in the pighouse on 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, in Qinghai Province (China).
According to the reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from Junnan neighbouring province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, my cousin found a man's body and noticed an open door to a pigeon.
He said there was a large powder in the chlew with blood on the rice.
The corpse has confirmed that a farmer has mortally beaten the pig near 250-km.
“ My cousin’s legs were bloody and crucified,” said the man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
On the surveillance footage, Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview for the Guiyang Evening News that for the time of the collection of evidence by the police, it was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to the reports, the man's family and the government negotiated compensation for death.
Cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported before, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier in Wales, almost a 300-kilogram pig smothered a farmer into a tractor.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitobio said CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can liberate them with brutal behaviour.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as touching as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
It is simply necessary to show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will cause intensive rainfall in the southwest of the United States
According to the forecasts, Rosa's hurricane loses its strength, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause intensive rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Huragan Rosa is at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 p.m., he was awarded a category of 1. It was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast, Rosa will be moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean begins to form itself than moving eastern to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, moving the mass of wet air to the north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall up to 25 cm in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the following days, wet tropical air enters into contact with the approaching lower causes damp rainfall in the South West of the United States.
In some places, the rainfall of heights 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, pollution movements and possible drainages in desert areas.
The damp tropical air will cause rainfall from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially for parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is foreseen in some areas of the South West of the United States, especially above the large part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical precipitation, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the danger of tropical rain, it is strongly advised to move on foot in the desert.
The great sinks can change the canyons in the bulk of the river, and the storms with lightning will cause local porry winds and dust movement.
It's coming before he brings a huge local rainfall on the coast of South California.
The rains are possible with a total height of over 1,3 cm, which can cause small movements of pollutants and road danger.
It would be the first rainfall in the region.
The tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and on Tuesday, the rains will occur on more areas.
On Tuesday, the great rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, along with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur.
This can lead to rapid temperature changes at small distances.
A good example is Sunday temperature differences in the middle of the States.
Between Kansas City (state Missouri) and Omaha (state Nebraska) and between St. Louis (state Missouri) and Des Moines (state Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, summer temperatures may increase again.
In the large parts of the Central and Eastern States, the warm beginning of October is expected. Temperatures should vary within the limits of 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the south of the Great Levels to the North East.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York can reach the value of up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
The long-term climate forecasts show a high probability of over average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's auditions
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations moving a quarterly hearing of a candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman prosecuting a lawyer for sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impase on Friday, commentators had to stop regularly broadcasting programmes to inform the sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation of charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Court's committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh was in a state of insecurity and tried to take off her clothes during the high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that the Friday number of televisions was even greater than that of Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television stations.
However, other stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network have not yet been available.
In addition, Nielsen is usually difficult to measure visibility among people at work.
The number is similar to the traceability of American football matches or the awards of the American Film Academy.
According to reports of Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose presenters firmly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest rating, and it carried out on average 5.69 million viewers during a week's interview.
The second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became the key form of Friday events.
In the morning, he was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras after this moderate republic office issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the recording, he shouts at demonstrators who hindered him to enter the elevator on the way to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake with his head loose for a few minutes listened to unfair opinions. The whole event was transmitted by the CNN station.
"I stand here before you, and I ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have so much power in the face of the disease of many women," he heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before closing the door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would say it during the committee hearing.
Later, television stations continued to transmit events pending the vote on Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate.
Flake said that he would support the nomination only if he knew that the FBI would examine the charges in the coming week, which insisted on the minority of the Democrats.
Flake had partly talked to their friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after meeting Chris Coons and some other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republicans would not have had the voices needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI proceedings on charges against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for its own benefit
In an interview given to Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her abandonment plan of the European Union to play the future of Great Britain and to undermine national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Birmingham Conservative Party conference, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to that of Theresa May on the title page, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked the plan of future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU could take duties on their behalf, calling it "total incredibly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims' shooting: the police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected the LSU killer.
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shot of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colours of Louisiana University (LSU).
According to the report from the police in Baton Rouge, Dyteon Simpson was detained and arrested under second-grade murder.
The authorities published the video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police informed that Sims lost glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS, the WAFB police officers found these glasses on the spot and traces of Simpson's DNA were detected.
The police informed Simpson that he confessed to shooting Wayde.

On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that caused the death of a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police command expressed its thanks to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the nearby residents for assisting in the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, the Director of Sports for LSU, thanked local law enforcement authorities for "working and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 198-inch man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season he recorded averages at 5.6 points and 2.6 matches.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "healthy" and "haired" by Wayde's death.
“This is one of those things we are constantly afraid of,” said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by volcano reaches the city of Mexico
Popocatépetl volcano ashes came to the southern capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre remedyed Mexico’s people’s approach to volcano in connection with the increase in activity in the crate and 183 gas and ashes emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre has reported numerous abdominal dyspnoeas and shocks.
Photographs published in social media show the front doors of cars covered with a thin layer of ashes in the districts of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7.1 degrees, which haunted Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have seen an increase in volcano activity located 72 km southeast of the capital of the country.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Staring police with Catalonese separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona as a result of the attempts of demonstrators supporting Katalonia's independence with the preventive police departments. Thousands of people took part in the hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme referendum on the Katalonia Secession.
A group of masked supporters separated by eggs and powder painted police officers. The dark clouds of dust used to bind the streets full of tourists.
There was also a later part of the day to stop the force of the police from using the palm to stop fighting.
For a few hours, the groups supporting independence scand “We do not forget, we do not forgive,” while the opposers of the secession screamed “They live Spain.”
As the local press reports, 14 people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries during protests.
After the 1st October referendum, the tension was not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, it is still a reason for celebrating the desirers of the Catalan secession.
However, the voters of the majority were announced for independence, because of the wide-ranging fighters.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost a thousand were injured last year in brutal attacks with the police trying to prevent votes in electoral places.
On Friday night, a group of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstration of supporting policemen.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change in the route has been forced.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved with his wife in the separatist protest, said that there is no hope for the independence of Catalonia.
“ Last year, we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were happy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck in a point without leaving," he said.
Despite the significant, although a small victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the Catalonia section have been difficult to continue the operation. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or await a trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and later announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanic who recorded the phone with a protest supporting the police, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute have led to a conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalonic leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced the desire to take off in the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"Canded in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crises of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving in the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a few hits in a car house in Londonderry.
The event occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 British time (BST).

Mengi Gate provides Livingston win over Rangers 1:0
The first Dolly Mengi goal for Livingston brought the team a victory
From this season, Livingston's club has been throwing the Rangers in a foolish way, giving Steven Gerrard the second failure in his 18 matches at the position of the club coach from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's gate turned out to be winning, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team under Gerrard's commander stays in this season without winning a trip to the Premiership. In the next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which eight points lose.
Before that, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the EUFA League.
Livingston extends a series of wins in his division to six matches.
Livingston missed a few occasions against undisposed opponents
The band led by Holt was supposed to hold a lot earlier, because the team game caused many problems to the Rangers.
First Scott Robinson went through the defense and shot into the gatelight, but he couldn't shoot the goal. Then Alan Lithgow didn't hit Craig Halkett's head after he took over.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the gates, knowing that they can jeopardize the rivals during the constant pieces of the game.
And that's how the decisive gate fell.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created a situation of Menga, who won the goal from the middle of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't push the host's defense and did not cause any bigger problems to Liam Kelly's goalkeeper.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's gate.
Scott Pittman's attempt was deprived by the Allan McGregor Ranger's goalkeeper, and Lithgow couldn't get into the light of the gateway from the next permanent part of Livingston.
Rangers continued attacks in the Livingston penal field, but they couldn't use the situation. They demanded two criminals after Halkett's intervention against Glen Middleton's variable and one hand play, but in both cases the pretences of the players were rejected.
“Fenomenal” show Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great show and result for Livingston.
He thinks they played great, once again, beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from return to extraclass, but Holta should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a great organized defense, but Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although under Gerrard's command, they happen great moments, they didn't keep their standards in the game.
Their game seemed to lack something: only once it managed to break through the host's defense. It should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were found in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to visit Erdogan in Cologne
During Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the wake-up controversy of President Erdogan's visit in Germany. Visits aimed at improving the relationship between NATO allies.
The disputes led to differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of press and accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After the Erdogan meeting, he went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
In this town there is the largest number of Turks outside of their homeland.
As the police said, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd was blocked from the temple, but the president's supporters gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of the opposers of Erdogan, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning the politics of Turkey's leader and the decision of the German Government to adopt policies in the country.
Contradictory protests reflect the divisions that the visit of the politician of the hero was raised by some Turks living in Germany and considered to be an autocracy by others.

In October last year, the company called for preventive forces due to dangerous riots in which workers were attacked by balls at the balls of the balls.
The sudden floods caused by the hurricane of Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought areas)
It's rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona's state. It's likely to happen at the beginning of the next week. Rosa's hurricane remains move in the deserts of the South West, creating a threat to the sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the potential for sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. The rainfall will begin on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclons have maintained the state of the storm or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from Arizona's border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas, Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the South West, including the central Skalist Mountains and the Great Cotlin, the precipitation height will probably be 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
Persons from outside the areas at risk of sudden floods with hurricane Rosa can be relieved because the region has been fighting drought for a while.
Although floods are a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where there is a state of drought.
As reported by the portal weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of Arizona's area faces affected droughts belonging to the other of the highest categories.
Hurricane Rosa arrives first at the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa continued to move with the strength of the hurricane, reaching a speed of 137 km/h. It is currently 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and headed north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The Hurricane encounters the cooler waters of the Peace Ocean, which causes its weakness.
According to the forecast, he will hit Mexico with the force of tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intense rainfall in some parts of Mexico can create a major flooding threat.
Portal weather.com reported that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwest of the state of Sonor, the rainfall is 7 to 15 cm, although they can reach 25 cm.”
Then the hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico towards the north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, early morning hours, it will reach the border of Arizona as tropical depression.
“The most serious threats created by the hurricane Rosa or its residues are a very huge rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwest of the state of Sonora and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” states the National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecasts, rains will cause sudden floods and pollutant movements in the desert and mudlines in the mountains.

Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh “has experienced anger and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at the age in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “has experienced anger and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Congress. He strongly and emotionally denyed the charges of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman says that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault on her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges she was prosecuting.
On Saturday, the president said that that day, “Americans could find out about brilliantness, class and courage,” Kavanaugh.
“The voice devoted to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, the expert of the law on great benefits for the community,” said the crowd of supporters in the West Virginia.
The president was not directly referring to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of the participation of the Republicans in half the election presidency.
“From the most important choices in our lives, we are five weeks apart.
I don't start in these elections, but I stay very active," he said.
"I keep fighting to defend our wonderful candidates."
Trump claims that the Democrats are developing "resistance and impediment policies".
As the CNN station said, one of the assistants of the Republican important policy, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
As the authorities reported on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by high waves breaking through the beaches – following a strong earthquake and tsunami that haunted the Indonesian Sulawesi island.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival. About the shore of the shore hit waves reaching even 6 meters high, kidnapping many people and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami was the result of earthquake at 7.5 degrees.
“When there was a threat yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fall victim to tsunami” said at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho conference, the spokesperson of the Indonesian Nugroho Natural Disaster Agency.
“Tsunami attacked everything on its way, kidnapping cars, hulls and houses,” said Nugroho. Then he added that before reaching the coastline, the natural man moved to the sea at 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them saved themselves climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
In the air photographs published by the Natural Disaster Agency, there are many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and blown bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town haunted secondary shocks.
There was a number of earthquakes in an area of 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency's statement on the evaluation and use of technologies (BPPT), the energy liberated by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement concludes that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could be affected by tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described damage as "markable" and said that hundreds of houses, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels were collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under the inflamed buildings, 540 were injured, and 29 people were considered missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and injury can be greater along the coastline of 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicentre of earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the communication “has been completely paralyzed,” so there are no reports from Donggal Province.
“The place is more than 300 thousand people,” read the Red Cross statement. It was also added that workers and volunteers of organizations are going to the places affected by the disaster.
“We can now speak of tragedy, although the situation may deteriorate considerably,” said the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met a general critic because there was no information about the tsunami hit in Palu. However, the authorities indicated that the waves came just after the warning.
There is a man who screams from the building trying to warn about the coming tsunami of the people on the street.
In a few minutes, the wall of the water broke by the shore, taking buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortcomings in the supply of electricity, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn hampered the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the military started sending transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic articles of first need.
The airport located in the city is only opened for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is to visit the centres for evacuated people in Palu.
Over 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseba T. Sinay, the National Director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from Donggala Province to Palu and found shelter in the tents of the brezents placed in the office courtyard.
“ They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although part of the groups slowly begin to carry assistance, the voices of criticism appear that workers of foreign humanitarian organisations with rich experience are prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's law, financing, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the national disaster site has been announced.
It hasn't been done yet.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster,” said the spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there was a national disaster, we will be able to start taking international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
After two days from the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing people continue to hope that their closest miracles will be found among the destructions.
A little boy was dragged out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who spent two days under the grudge of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paralotniarian Representation, trained two missing paralotarians attending the end of this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples.
“ As an experienced paralotnial, I am in trouble with my own emotional burden, ” he said.
Gendon Subandono told me how, within a few hours of the arrival among the parasol community, information about the crash of the hotel Roa Roa desperately sent messages by the CosApp communist to the athletes involved in the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
“I believe that this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.

Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
By proclaiming his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “Osoba known earlier as Kanye West.”
Forty-one-year-old musician has been using a nickname Ye for a while. It is also the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change took place before visiting the Saturday Night Live program. It is expected that the artist will present his new album called Yandhi during the performance.
He will replace Ariana Grande's singer, who, according to the creators, gave up "for emotional reasons".
West has already said that the word “Ye” is not only a short cut from his present artistic home, but is religious.
“I think that “yee” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means “You”,” said West in the previous period of year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter about Big Boy’s nickname.
“So I am you, I am us, it is about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – the reflection of all our good, bad and confusing qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted him to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West’s associate, also recorded his nickname in various ways, with a connector, without connectors and great letters.
President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use a military against civilians
In the early 50th anniversary of the bloody deficiencies of the student demonstration, the President of the Mexico Election Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has committed himself to never use the army against civilians.
On Saturday at three cultures, López Obrador promised: “Do not use the army to repress the Mexican nation.”
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fire at the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. It happened during the time the left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the young people of Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance to students, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal groups.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee says, the investor and the expert of artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, together with the increase in Chinese activity in this area, the US should double the expenditure on SI research.
The comments made are related to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by the various US government agencies, despite the fact that the US does not have an official strategy on SI.
In the meantime, China presented their plan last year, according to which they wish to become the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"In the beginning, the SI research budget should be doubled: all other countries are far beyond the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this field" said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview given this week, CNBC also said that double funding could double increase the chances of a further breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Superpowerment of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Krzemowa Valley and the New Order of the World) published the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing this month as the CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most significant companies involved in artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the formation of the SI system, which defeated the best American player in the Othello game. He then became head office in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee accepted the success of previous technological initiatives of the US Government, such as the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked for the deadline for the next edition of struggles, as he believes it will help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to try very hard to get government grants.
“It is not China that receive us the best representatives of the academic community, but corporations,” said Lee.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
“I note that those who have been engaged in artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctor’s degree should automatically be awarded a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan for the creation of artificial intelligence of the next generation.
As Lee observed, the Chinese National Science Foundation (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions in a similar way to the American National Science Foundation and other governmental organisations granting American researchers. However, the quality of academic activities in China is lower.
In the previous period of this year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a combined artificial intelligence centre (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which will engage in the work of industry and science partners. The White House announced the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
In addition, this month, the DARPA has also informed the AI Next AI.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than USD 100 billion per year in the SI research.
At the same time, the American initiative aimed at setting up a national artificial intelligence security committee has not been stepping forward for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of their name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This movement would allow a few decades of dispute with Greece, which prevents the efforts of the country to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and therefore initiated the joining of the country to the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the nomenclature, but nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority living in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said that he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraged the fighter to raise doubts about whether the attendance would reach a minimum level of 50% required to recognise the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters to change the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young people of Macedonia could live free under the European Union's umbrella, and EU membership will provide us with greater security" - said the 79-year-old Georgievska Olivia from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians declared that it would respect the results of the vote.
The amendment of the name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament members.
The state election committee informed that no unusual events were recorded by 13 hours.
However, the attendance at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the recent 2016 parliamentary elections.
“I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old Tanewski voter of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Zoran Zaew, his wife, Zorica, and Duszko's son, voted in a referendum on the change of the country's name to open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
Before the building of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Władimir Kawardarkow prepared a small scene and set chairs in front of tents set up by the fightcotts of the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU membership, but we want to join these organisations with a dismantled head, not a rear door,” said Kawardarkow.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can address other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will speak for the change of the name in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," said Zaew after the vote.
He found that the vote on "yes" was "acknowledged by our future."
In the survey published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared the desire to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required attendance.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV TV TV on Sunday referendum, 57% of respondents are planning to vote.
70% of the surveyed said that they would support the change of the name.
In order to succeed the vote, the attendance must be 50% + 1 vote.
The event in the referendum would be the first serious hit on the Western government's policy since the May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats the entire defense of Brighton and wins the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home to Brighton defense in a Saturday meeting completed by 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (Anglia).
The gate won by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with the administration in the middle of the field to the Argentinian attacker.
The baller crossed three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
First he played one of them, and then he crossed the others, and he was on the edge of the Brighton Penalty.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in a criminal field that beat Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the gate.
“Aguero is experiencing foot injury,” said Coach Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
“We were talking about the possibility to play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he won the gate at that time."
However, Sterling provided the blue first time in the Premier League.
The gate here was 29 minutes away.
In the action of this Aguero, he got the ball deep in half Brighton.
He sent a wonderful pass along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move on a far-reacher.
Manchester City attacker put a ball to the grid just before she hit the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the EUFA Masters League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of the Rockies victory
After losing the chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he didn't have to be in the first composition.
However, the loving Scherzer rivalry hopes to happen at a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies if only the Rockies keep the chances of playing in the playoff phase. Currently, the team has one victory more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
The Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against Nationals by 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title of the division champion.
“For instance, we play “o nothing”, at least we go to the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting."
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for a Sunday meeting, but the team is inclined to exhibit Scherzer in the first composition.
It would be Scherzer's thirty-four performance in the first composition. The player took part in the fourthrzut training and hopes to appear on Sunday.
The right-hand slot driver of the Washington team notes the results of 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300-fold eliminated the packagers and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trumpa in West Virginia
The Trump did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination at the Supreme Court's Judge, discussing the importance of the participation of the Republicans in half the election presidency.
"In November, we put all the achievements that have been done.
From one of the most important choices in our life, we've been sharing five weeks.
Even though I don't start, I'm staying very active, constantly defending our wonderful candidates," he said.
He then continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their own actions.
They are determined to take power with any means they can, they are subtle and mean.
They don't care who they're going to hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "resistance and impediment."
“It was very well seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats“ bad, mean, miserable, untruthful and untruthful.”
The president referred to the Senate Court of Justice, calling on the name and name of the American senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, which happened with the crowd's voice bumping.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
"Uch, I'm listening?
No... I mean... no». Her body's speech was terrible. It was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a grouping of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those expressing their own opinions
When the activists of the Momentum organization in my party voted in favour of giving me guilty, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am a member of the Labour Party's Members, who have recently been told that they are not welcome, and all of this is because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, met with a similar treatment because she opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the application for nagany was due to the difference between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences were the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As with irony, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In the Friday announcement of the meeting of Parliamentary Labour Party from Nottingham East, you could read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
For eight years, I have served as a member of the Labour Party for most of the afternoon Friday meetings of the General Committee have looked this way.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now different, but a long time ago, they have forgotten the promise of a “serving and milder” policy, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the lot managers.
All began soon after the position of the President by Jeremy Corbyn. The colleagues, in which I thought we had similar views, began expecting a change of direction and positions that I would not agree with before, and they covered issues such as national security or the single EU market.
After every public speech – no matter the content – I meet in social media with attacks calling for the nomination, condemnation of the censorship or abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am happier than some of my colleagues, because my comments are more political.
I admire professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience every day sexual or racist treatment, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with the insulting of others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn found that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views, with every request for a “woman of disadvantage” and any change in the world’s choice of the party’s view is inconsistent.
In the last two years, I have been suggested that I stay out of the question and keep quiet, and then everything would be fine.
That's not why I took care of politics.
From joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a disciple as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to the breakdown of my school class, I try to care for better quality of public services for those who need – both as a local councilman and minister.
I've never covered my convictions, too, during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position, and they knew the differences in opinions with the authorities of the party.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the chairman of the matrimonials in the face of the coming Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (also members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threat to revoke the nomination or the immediate political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – unbearable Ayr again in the mountain
Two late assignments could have somewhat outlined the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved a victory in this extremely interesting Scottish game of extraliga.
The team was first in the table and remains the only unbearable team.
At the end, it is a distinctive defense and better use of opportunities led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his supporters.
“The games have been a challenge to us so far, but we are still inconvenient, so I am pleased,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “I need to give respect to the players of Ayr. They have better used the occasions that arise from us.”
Ayr went to conduct 14 minutes after Grant Anderson's assignment and the increase of Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to match the score when Jason Baggot caught a ball after an unused chance of raising.
Climo increased the conduct of Ayr after kicking out of a penal drop just before the end of the first half. First he won the assignment, and then he took advantage of the chance to increase, gaining the score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half. Patrick Anderson's assignment increased by Baggot decreased the loss to five points.
Then there was a long stop for a serious injury of Ruaridha Knott. The player was removed from the field on the noses. After renewal of Ayr increased conduct after Stafford McDowall and Clim increased.
In the next order, the captain of the band Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose reused its number: the addition with an unused attempt to increase Bruce Colvin was reduced to conduct.
The hosts took over the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Clim without the ball. MacPherson scored the attachment on the back of the upcoming defense.
Climo used the chance to increase, and then again he managed to increase the result just after the renewal of the game, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from a penitential shot and allowed the wing Gregor Henry to gain the fifth attachment for the host.
Still Game's show star is starting a career in the gastronomics industry
Ford Kieran, Still Game's star, seems to be starting business in the gastronomic industry. It has recently been discovered that he was the director of the restaurant manager.
The 56-year-old actor is in the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC station sitcoms. He is also acquainted with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
Duet announced that the coming nineth season will be the last in the history of the show, and everything suggests that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to the official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the "emerging gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
“More belongs to us”: without access to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen her way to the Pacific
Marine patrols the navy base in La Paz.
There are blue flags from public buildings.
The following motto is seen in the Navy ports from Titicaca Lake to Amazon: “The sea is ours under the law.
His recovery is our duty."
In the restless access to the sea of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the largest for several decades, and Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which is to be issued on 1 October after the last five years of the process.
“Bolivi’s children are devastating, and the inhabitants are unanimous, optimistic, and they count on a favourable verdict,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will have a joint view of the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that the organisation based in the Hague will recognise the claim of Bolivia and after decades of unprofessional Chile discussions will have to join the negotiations on granting an independent state of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will be able to raise up the controversy of the fight for reelection next year, also puts hope in the Monday judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that the chances of a favourable decision for Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations authority established in Hague has no power to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. He also warned that it would not affect the possible discussions.
As Paz Zárate said, the Chilean international law specialist, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final argument has been presented, so briefly it shows that the matter was not complicated.
For the last four years, Bolivia might have departed the country from its destination.
“The question of access to the sea was implemented by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Zárate.
Morales' insolent rhetoric deprived the Chilians of any kind of goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point restore conversations, but it will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
In the case of both these countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree that the decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday, Bolivia will bring “a unique opportunity to start a new time with Chilean relations” and the possibility of “finding 139 years of dispute with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the topic of access to the sea as a part of the political game.
"Boliness will never abandon the right to access the Peace Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an excellent opportunity to believe that we have to deal with the past."
North Korea's thieves claim nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at the time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be at the edge of the renewal of suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with the North Korea leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri argues that the “freeze” is as if the lack of abolition of sanctions and the opposition of the US against the ending of the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington doesn't want to agree to sign the declaration without Pjongjang taking any concrete disarming steps beforehand.
Both Kim Jong Un and President of the United States Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a common scepticism about Pjongjang being seriously approaching the elimination of arsenall, which is perceived in North Korea as the only measure that guarantees security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump Summit.
Parsian fashion shows will elevate the appearance of the latest line of great head covers in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover yourself in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The Valentino and Thom Browne fashion designers presented a number of crazy, overdimensional head covers included their summer collections for 2019, which enlightened the style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Instagram, these designers decided to present their stunning creatures on the runway.
Valentino was a distinctive giant beige hat decorated with a wide feather rondo pouring the head of a model.
Other superdimensional accessories included arbusions decorated with jewels, a witch hat, and even ananas — were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter style than haute couture.
One creation reminded of diving equipment with tubes and glasses, and another looked like ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with great fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers foresee that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
Undimensional hats follow “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a wide width of 61 cm ronde, which all wore — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cumulative brand behind this extremely unprofessional hat, which spilled through social media, presented another great creativity on the run — a strawed beach bag almost as big as the model dressed in a bathing suit.
A burned orange bag of reef, finished frying from the reef and rigged with white leather hand, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Luke Armitage, a stylist of the stars, told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in the next year’s shops, because the designer managed to make such a big impact, it would be difficult not to use demand for superdimensional accessories.”
John Edward: language skills needed for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland continue to enjoy their scientific achievements — in 2018 they could commend themselves with other excellent results of exams, individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other social projects.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of schools attending more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland are striving to provide the best level of services to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, chosen by their career paths and to point their role as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector with the possibility of developing and implementing a curriculum tailored to school needs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired subjects to choose in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language that understands, then it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes into his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages take place first in league rankings, with the highest performance indicators for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received a higher A evaluation.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received higher A in Mandarin and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of the French students and 63 percent of the Spanish students also received an A evaluation.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, the teaching of languages, as subjects to choice, is conducted in the same range as the science of STEM objects (scientific sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the framework of curriculum programmes in independent schools and other places.
The 2014 study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that the lack of language skills of candidates was responsible for the reason for the difficulty of providing employers with free jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people to start a career.
These skills are necessary in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language knowledge,
The lifelong ability, as learning a second language, will provide a great advantage in the future, regardless of the path of professional development.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically increases the opportunities of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to YouGov's 2013 survey, in which more than 4,000 adult British participated, 75% of them were unable to speak well in foreign language, and French was the only language that had a two-digit interest, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for children today.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will provide children with more opportunities to find adequate employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ in terms of language taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important to the UK in the terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, in independent schools there will always be a lot of languages to choose which will be taught by specialised teaching staff in this area.
Scotland schools are independently involved in the creation of a teaching environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills necessary for the reference of success, irrespective of what the future is preparing for them.
It is now impossible to deny that in the international business environment languages are still key to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer a large choice, diversity and level of schools in Scotland.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut at the Lakers team on Sunday at San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James debut in Los Angeles Lakers finally got there.
Luke Walton, the Lakers Coach, announced that LeBron James was playing a Sunday presesonal match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
“More than one but less than 48,” said Walton on the official Lakers team’s website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, told Twitter that James would probably be playing a few minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked for his plans for six presesonal Lakers matches.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in the presonal games to prepare," he said.
So the electoral Trumpa in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight at Wheeling in Virginia of West Electoral A series.
This is the first of the five electoral trains that Trumpa planned to take place next week, along with the positions in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to the vote confirming that his election is abstaining in the Supreme Court of Trump, it seeks to build support in the upcoming government elections, as the Republican authorities may threaten to lose control of the Congress when votes are given in November.
What time will the election Trumpa in West Virginia take place tonight and where will you see him on the Internet?
So the electoral Trumpa in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held today at 7 p.m. at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So the electoral Trumpa in West Virginia will be followed live by the Internet on YouTube.
The Trump is likely to speak on these weekly hearings of the candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with the claims of sexually wrong behaviour, as well as the expected vote in Senate on the suspension of the choice for a maximum of one week, at the time of the FBI's investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral ages is to support the Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump's campaign with five ships next week is aimed at "mobilising volunteers and supporters to assist the Republicans in protecting and expanding most in the Senate and Chamber of Representatives" — Reuters.
"The Congress Control is such an important point in the President's schedule that, as the hottest season of the campaign is approaching, he will visit as many states as possible," said the spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not consent to the name of the campaign, Reuters.
Today's electoral age at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as attention from Pittsburgh media" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday Trump will visit the West Virginia — the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey who loses in probes.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the probes," said Simon Haeder, the polytologist from West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States Team shows the spirit of fighting, maintaining hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the format of foursome held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating distress shuttle is a completely invented sports concept, but one in which players really believe, and already the most in the competitions such as these.
So what's their distress at this point?
"They led six points, and now they're only four, so I think we're having a little trouble," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, leads four points, while there are twelve more to gain.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have a worthy pattern to imitate, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could commend with three points of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams on the whole throat, which was a sign of thrilling, became increasingly louder during the course of his round, taping the key putt and winning the game when he and Thomas gained two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them the victory of the 15th result, met a similar shout — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
“It is enough to focus and worry about its own game,” said Spieth.
It's all that's left to any of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unrestricted history of Ryder Cup.
A strange, but a lovely couple of European teams won four out of four and she was not wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't get bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, which could seal the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they played different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to discuss the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and double on the front nine kicked the Spanish and the Swedish into the hole that they would never get out of.
There's no one here on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how the strategy may change at one time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has a fight cut in which some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe with results 10-6 includes the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning with the results of 10-6 Saturday fourball matches and foursome with the United States.
Inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — allowed a draw to win two victorys on the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing its current score on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an invaluable American team in a four-ball morning format, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States had greater resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches, but they couldn't make losses.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must get eight points from 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter that won four points in a row, while along with Molinarim (the band was named "Molliwood" after a sensible weekend) is just the second couple in the history of Ryder Cup, which won four points in four opening matches.
After being crushed by Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball format, they defeated the pumped Woods and the American debut of Dechambeau, gaining even more empathic score of 5&4.
Woods, who was tired over two Saturday matches, occasionally showed the flashes of the genius, but he lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and it's seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the four-ball morning format, returned to Henrik Stenson in a four-way format to overcome the results of 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, working in world ranking, respectively, items 1 and 3.
However, the European team did not all go by thinking in this pleasant, cool day on a field on the southwest of Paris.
The three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a reference point for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 on Hiszpan Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball format and returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup happened to make the team a four-point loss, starting a single, although the Furyk team would only have enough draw to preserve the trophy.
However, taking the second place two days ago, Sunday countertrack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says “standardly not” a unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday in the UN speech that the absence of sanctions only deepens the lack of trust in North Korea to the United States and there is no way that this country unilaterally abandons nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling nuclear trial sites and commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any specific response from the US, however," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances there is no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the known North Korean complaints about the reluctance of Washington against the “degree” approach to denuklearisation, in which North Korea would be awarded for progressive action, his statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as it happened in the past.
Ri referd to the joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the U.S. President and the North Korea leader, held on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed to working on the "deuclarisation of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (from 1950 to 1953), but the United States representative announced that Pjongjang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also relyed on calls for the mitigation of raw international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insist on "deucclearisation in the first place" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a compulsive way, even opposing the signing of the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“Acknowledgement that sanctions can throw us on our knees is the clouds of people who act ignorantly against us.
The problem is, however, that the lack of abolition of sanctions deepens our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Unem and Donald Trump, which he spoke about at the beginning of the week of the United States leader at the UN.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim Jong Unem and the leader of South Moon Jae-inem in the last five months, and he added: “If the party on denuclearisation was South Korea, and not the United States, then there was no such impasse in the field of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.”
Mim this, the tone of the speech of Ri was completely different compared to last year, when he said that during the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea missiles in the United States is inevitable after Mr Evil President Trump called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (man of a rocket) for a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations Trump, who threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea last year, commended Kim Jong Una for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but also said that there is still a lot of work to be done, and said that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions will not be abolished.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not appoint that time range, saying: “Independently whether it would take two years, three years or five months — it does not matter.”
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council that "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued and constant until we find full, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea, attempting to repel the financing of Pjongjang nuclear and ballistic rockets.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pjongjang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress has been made, and in a few hours North Korea condemned him for "setting gangster demands".
North Korea has committed itself this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-inem that it will disassemble the test site of missiles and nuclear complex if the United States have taken "the appropriate means".
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the "relevant measures" he cared about were security guarantees to ensure that Trump committed himself in Singapore, and to take steps to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course for adequately long resting
The new Harvard University course, which took place this year, provided students with more sleep, which aimed at combating a growing culture of macho, consisting of learning by “the full-on caffeine-powered students.”
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basis for self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
It was inspired by a speech on the impact of deprivation of sleep on science to create a course.
“After the speech ended, one girl came to me, and she said, “Why is it to me when I'm at the last year of college?”
She said that no one has ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students explain how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as to improve the overall sense of students.
Paul Barreira, psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health, said that this course was decided to be introduced after the student found to suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
An hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the room in the dorm where students click coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the effect of caffeine and light and how the sleep shortage affects sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain the regularity of sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term absence of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what health effects the smoking of cigarettes brings together,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride from “night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students is increasing the problem of lack of sleep.
The provision of sufficient amount of sleep with good quality should be “a secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to avoid weighting because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go through hunger modes, which makes the student constantly hungry, ” he said.
Raymond So, 19-year-old California, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the whole campus.
The next step he believes is to invite all students to graduate a similar study programme before they move to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students set a reminder alarm when you need to go to sleep and when you need to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can distract the daily rhythm and lead to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga settles Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered once again in the fight to leave in Livingston, when Dolly Menga led to the failure of Steven Gerrard's team, getting the score of 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record its first victory from the 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 matches, causing the difference of eight points to the leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' composition showing the lack of engagement didn't look to be better.
While the Rangers recorded a decline in the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third — just behind Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers' team may have further problems in connection with the need to bear the head of the Caluma Spence liner's judge's head after he was hit by the subject thrown from the court for guests.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which allowed Ayr to go ahead and move to the semifinal Betfred Cup.
In turn, Holt went through with the same eleven of Livingston, who took the Hearts team point last week, as an enthusiastic way in which his well-trained team was tired on every step of his opponents.
The Rangers may and dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston's team did more with the ball once they got it.
They should've gotten the goal in just two minutes, when it was the first set of the ball by Menga that allowed Scott Pittman to face the Allan McGregor gate, but the helper didn't take advantage of his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then edited a deep free shot to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who played the defender's position, could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers recovered control in the third quarters, but it looked like they had more hope than the faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that he had a 15-minute sentence before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless were invaded, but Judge Steven Thomson had developed the claim of Colombian.
The Rangers were able to give only two target shots in the first half, but they were Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, barely concerned the head of Lassana Coulibala and a weak arrow of Ovie Ejaria.
While the goals of Livingston in 34 a minute of opening the game could be opposed to the game, no one can deny that they deserved the effort put in it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with a deep constant part of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball at Scott Robinson, who kept his peace, giving it to Menga to make a simple finish of action.
Gerrard did not leave during the break and exchanged Coulibaly to Ryan Kent — this exchange almost immediately influenced the wing that threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was able to block it from its position.
Livingston team continued to drag guests into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett performed long-distance applications one after another.
Holta's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor's been well in front of Jacobs, and then Lithgow left the game from the corner.
The Reserve Rangers, Glenn Middleton, had hoped again for a sentence when Jacobs got involved, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: Geiger Count inventor
And now the page from our edition of “Sunday Morning” Almanac: 30 September 1882 — 136 years ago... the day in which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which ultimately led to the installation known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become both a element of science and popculture, such as in the "Bells of Coronado" film of 1950, where you seemingly unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It is the Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Now there is something going on!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention his name has survived until today.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system “see” to the enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system “see” to the enemy cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the enemy cells in treatment.
This method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
At that time they can “see” protein common to many cancers. They are then injected again into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of tumours.
One woman treated with an immune system has been observed to recognise the enemy cell cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” protein common to many tumours called HER2 and then re-injection to the patient of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Rac at Bethesda in Maryland said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is very well-railed.”
HER2 “induces the growth of several types of tumours”, including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs and thick intestines, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach consisting of the collection of immune cells from patients and the ‘učení’ of cancer cells worked to treat a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is going to the pro-trumping diatry in the Saturday Night Live program — with the MAGA hat on the head.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was "built" at the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he commended the President of the United States of Donald Trump and said that he would apply for office in 2020.
After the night he made his third song named Ghost Town, where he had a cap with the title of "Make America Great", he performed a lecture against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I speak with white people, I hear: “How can you like Trump? He is racist! ”
If I were to worry about racism, I would've moved out of America long ago," he said.
The SNL program started with Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's statements made before the Senate Court of Justice on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the recording with West's output was sent to the social media by Chris Rock's comedian.
We don't know if Rock wanted to laugh at West by putting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems with his hat behind the backstage.
“They took the backstage at me.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're stuck on me!
And then they say I have no choice," said Washington Examiner.
West continued to say: “Do you want the world to go forward?
Let's accept."
His words doublely triggered the “survivor” of the audience, and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed — reports Varieta.
West was invited to the program following Ariana Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many performances of the song I Love it in dressing the bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUS Group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: I GOD FOR MAFIE’S PROCEDURE.”
By conducting a talk show, Karen Hunter on her Twitter, she said that West was simply “he was himself and it is absolutely wonderful.”
“I will NOT reward people (by buying her music or clothes or supporting her “sciences”) which, I believe, accepts and spreads harmful to my community of ideology.
He's free.
So are we free," she added.
Before the reporter's program, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and that he was now "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist who changed his name — he follows the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, accepted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed his name to symbol, and then the artist known as Prince.
An attempt to kill a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
45-year-old man was accused of attempting to kill after he stabbed a man's knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
It happened in Ballyhackamore, as the police say.
The accused is to stand in front of the grotesque court on Monday in Belfast.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor.
Star Game about the throne Kit Harington moves the issue of toxic menhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO Middle Ages series "Gra o throne".
31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play hard to be respected.
When he interviewed Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the toxic male problem in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the game plan of throne, a 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "possibly", moving this issue.
“I feel pretty sure at the moment — where we made a mistake about the subject of manhood, ” he said.
“What did we teach men during their growing up, looking at the perspective of the problem that we are dealing with now? ”
Kit believes that the development of toxic males can be partly responsible for television due to the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what lessons are they taught?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
It's clearly not all right with young men."
In an interview he also confessed that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel Game of the throne after the end of the series next year, saying that he “finded with battlefields and horses.”
As of November, Kit will play "True West" Sam Shepard, which is a story about the film producers and his brother, a thief.
The actor has recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that happened to him in Grea about the throne.
"I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this multi-fold award of the Emma fantasy series Rose played Ygritte — an object of loving interest in Kit, Jon Snow’s characters.
The couple was married in June 2018 in Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected by this problem, as reported by the health services of this country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
A decisive majority of new cases have been transmitted by sexual means, which means a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been almost completely reduced, as the Chinese health services said at the Yunnan Province Conference.
However, compared to a year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV by sexual means is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalised in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from the LGBT community is widespread.
In view of the conservative values of the country, research estimates that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transfer are due to insufficient protection during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured universal access to HIV medicines in the context of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her members revealed the Senators of the Republican Party, is “safe lies” and“ conspiracy theory.”
A member of the United States Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday, as if a member of its team had placed the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the above legislature.
The member of the L.A. Democratic Party has ensured that these charges have been filed by experts and websites related to the "ultra-legal wings".
"The lies, lies, and even more wicked lies," said Waters in the Twitter statement.
Public information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person in the Capitol during the hearing of the panel in Senate on sexual charges against the nominated Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the Kavanaugh candidate was questioned by three senators.
Conservative parties such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was linked to Waters' office and published information on the Waters member, as Hill says.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie," continued Waters.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these cheating and false charges — was not in any way responsible for leakage.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer’s former spokesperson of the White House.
"This is how denial is bad," wrote Fleischer.
“It suggests that it has no appropriate temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He can't question the motives of a prosecutor.
He must remain calm for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excess anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"The Gross case, if that's true," wrote on Tweeter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office informed "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent charges".
"The authors will be exposed and put to legal responsibility for all their actions which constitute a threat to any of my team members", said.
Film review Johnny English: Nokaut — spy parody with weakened Rowane Atkinson
The search for references to Brexit in every new film with the British thread has already become a standard. This seems to be used for a new part of the series of action and comedy “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 from the film “Johnny English” and returned to cinema screens in 2011 with the film “Johnny English: Reactation”.
Will a self-satira about how hopeless we are become the new export goods of the country?
In any event, the uncompetent Johnny English, who is ever surprisingly characterized by a rubber face, has regained a lotion license — his name and name more than anything else, indicates that he is a expanded, comic production intended for non-angloyal viewers.
Of course, he is a silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre delights to smoothie glamour has a little of the inspector Clouuseau, Jasia Fasoli and a drop of this guy who adds one note to the melodie theme of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world secretary — Atkinson used to play in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series there is one or two moments of attention.
I enjoyed a scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in the medieval armor, while his helmet rhythmically hit the shovels of the rotor.
On the screen, the gift of Atkinson to play comedy physically, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low flights and unnecessary, especially that today, also the “serious” film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humoral elements seem to be directed to children instead of adults — I think the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not so imaginary and consistent as gags in the German Atkinson films about Jasiu Fasoli.
Since always the current assumption is that the United Kingdom has been having serious problems.
Cyberhaker passes into the British super secret network of spys, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to be terrified by an agent in service, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the magic of the gorilla Prime Minister, which is a pompatic, wasted character already and so suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by the lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, incarcerated in the form of Theresa May, but the scenario does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her consultants from the intelligence agency inform her that because of the disclosure of the identity of all active spys will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And this means that Johnny English is incapable of his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent, a few good gags while being spying by English.
English is called to Whitehall for a recess, reconnecting with his former Bough assistant, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine commander — a joyful, but a little tired form played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin party in the secret ministry of Her Majesty are coming back to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletov, the character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic billionaire-technic manure, who claims that he can solve the computer problems of the United Kingdom, Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their crucite with absurd situations: dressed as waiters burn a French restaurant; they introduce chaos, smuggling into a deck of a luxury Volta yacht; and English smothers the desolation while using a set for virtual reality to get to know the inside of the Volty house.
In this last sequence, any limitations disappear, but despite a nice and smooth execution, the whole film is very similar to the television for children.
Typical diameter.
Like other Johnny English movies, I couldn't resist my thoughts: can't the British film industry give Ranowi Atkinson a role that would really match his talent?
Part of the job denies that it is a plan that provides for the British a four-day week of work for which they will receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider the introduction of a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary in five days.
The party says that the heads of the firms should give them the savings obtained by a revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional free day.
This means that workers could enjoy a three-day weekend, obtaining the same amount of remuneration.
Sources indicate that this idea will "incorporate" into the economic programme of the lot and plans for the country's exit against employees.
The transition to the 4th week of work was supported by the Vocational Union Congress as a way of using workers to change the economy.
An older member of the Labour Party in a chat with The Sunday Times said: “The policy change is expected to be announced before the end of this year.”
“This is not going to happen from day to day, but the fourteenth week of work is something that is included in the approach of the party to restore economic balance to the benefit of the employee, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has committed itself to introducing a fourteenth week of work in the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are not now supported by all the members of the Labour Party.
The Ombudsman of the Labour Party said: “The last week of work is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, the Chancellor from the shadow office, used the Labour Party's conference last week to present his vision to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from the "disciplinary directors" and "speculatives" in public service companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow office also mean that the present actors of aquatic companies may not recover their entire share, as the Government of the Labour Party could "reduction" on the basis of abuse detected.
He also confirmed the plans for the establishment of employees in company management and the establishment of integration ownership funds to provide 10 percent of the private sector's capital to employees who receive a annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in the "60 minutes" programme to ask if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh can make them change their attitude.
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and caused questions about whether the findings of the investigative office could make the Republican senators withdraw their support.
Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham on Sunday's interview, whether the FBI could discover something that could lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh when I went to the hearing.
I called him after how it happened when that charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined and unequivocal."
However, Graham's opinion seems to be cast out in stone.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it is a strong charge," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it's: Brett firmly denyed it," said Graham, calling Christine Blasey Ford.
“No person who has been able to verify this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to any extent to reducing poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will take place next Saturday in New York, an annual musical event that can honor the extremely impressive composition of the stars and the equally impressive mission — the eradication of poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival visits tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important objective of this event, which is eliminated by 2030 by extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an enlargement of Global Revenue Project, an international group of activists to combat poverty by increasing the number of actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending e-mail to a global leader, making a phone or other significant action to help increase awareness about the goal of eradication of poverty.
But what success can Global Citizen be commended for 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or another case called "clinicism", when people feel that they do something important, by signing the petition online or by placing an entry in Tweeter?
Global Citizen argues that more than 19 million "acts" have been recorded since 2011 in support of the action, striving to achieve a number of different objectives.
It also claims that these activities have helped the world leaders to raise commitments and rules worth more than 37 billion dollars to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, in which they had already paid or financed at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that secured measures have so far directly influenced almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and realisers involved in "helping children to achieve their full potential" which promised Rwanda to give $35 million to help eliminate imperfection in this country, after the members of Global Citizen sent over $4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizen, such as you, we can make the social injustice that is inexperience to history" – Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions have been carried out calling for the Great Britain to improve the quality of mother feeding, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which was “Why is certain that it would be possible to eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global citizens responded as follows: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will face and fail.
But, like in the case of the ever great movements for civil rights and the fight against the apartheide, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars during this year's event in New York, whose hosts will be Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to "block" of Russian energy exports — Secretary of Home Affairs
Washington may "in case of need" escape to his navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy on the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Home Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — particularly where it operates at the call of the lawful government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I consider that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to intermediate in energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States behind their navy have the opportunity to make sure that the seaways will remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy is not marketed," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group, which itself refers to the name of the "vote of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were actually the same.
"Iranian and Russia's economic policy is about using and replacing fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "fossil-fuel-based economy" with a "fossil-based economy.
These statements appeared when Trumpa’s administration continued a mission aimed at increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump's officials, including the United States President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the "unappropriate" project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trumpa has made Berlin's “the slave” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion to double existing capacity up to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's pathetic objection to the implementation of this project is solely due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I note that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers" said the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the Secretary of Energy of the United States Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States has triggered a violent reaction from Germany, which has confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI) called on the United States to not interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I consider this a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel with President of Russia Wladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she'd consider candidates for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday, that after the mid-term election, she'd consider candidates for the president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and it's also for a woman who's the highest position," she said, "The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider my president's candidate."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned the President Donald Trump, saying that “he leads the country in the wrong direction.”
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren expressed her criticism to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren wrote: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most voters Warren do not think she should be candidates in 2020.
Fifty eight percent of the voters from Massachusetts choosing the option "probably" said that the senator should not be candidate, as is the result of the survey carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for the candidates of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidate, and 48 percent were opposed to it.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken from attention to the potential candidate in 2020 were vice president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin speaks of post-traumatic stress team (PTSD) Fuel Track during the election sphere of Donald Trump
The Palin Track (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son passes through what he has to go through after he returns, I understand the other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers return with," said the audience at the electoral age of Donald Trump in Tuls in Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son, "the taboothema," and she said about her son and other war veterans: "they return a little differently, return the degraded, come back, wonder if they will be given respect for what their fellow soldiers, aviationmen and all other soldiers gave their country to each other."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla in Alaska and was accused of domestic violence on a woman, instructed to file false statements in the report on domestic violence and the possession of weapons in unsustainable state, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Vasile Police Department.
18 states and the Columbia District support the fight against the new asylum policy
The eighteen states and the Columbia District support the legal challenge for the new policy of the United States, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts submitted amicus curiæ in Washington on Friday to support the asylum seeker who faces this policy, as the NBC News says.
The full name of the lawsuit of Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union has lodged against federal politics in August, has not been revealed.
She said that her partner “and his violent sons from the gang” were abused by her, but the American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She's been detained in Texas.
The Prosecutors of the United States, supporting Grace, described Salwador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the USA, as countries facing widely occurring problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy repealed the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals of 2014 which allowed unauthorised immigrants to seek asylum against domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Prosecutor General of the District of Colombia, said in Friday's statement that the new policy "ignorates the existing state law, federal and international law for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle", as stated in the list of amicus curiæ.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy against immigrants invades the United States economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "a necessary labour force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered the Immigration Judges to stop granting asylum to victims running from domestic violence and the gangs.
"Azyl is available for those who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fear of racial, religious, nationality or due to their belonging to a specific social group or have such and not other political beliefs," said the Sessions in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — with whom people from all over the world face every day.
Desperate Rescue Trials in Palu when the number of deaths doubled in a race that aims to find survivors
It has become more and more tragic for the survivors.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said the 35-year-old mother Ris Kusum, comforting her depressed son in the evacuation center in Palu’s devastated town.
‘Every minute the ambulance imports the body.
There's no clean water."
The residents were seen to return to destroyed houses, searched through the water of things and trying to save everything they could find.
There were hundreds of people injured, and hospitals, damaged by the earthquake at 7.5 degrees, quickly overfilled.
Some wounded, including the two Haris, who had a spine and shoulder fractured, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes, as he said about the violent earthquake, which shocked peace on the fifth floor of the hotel, who shared with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save myself.
I think I've been pushed into a Romanian wall," Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife crying for help, and her voice went silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The Ambassador of the United States is accusing China of propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper put a four-stroke advertising in the American journal, which welcomes mutual benefits from US-Chinese trade, the Ambassador of the United States in China accused Beijing of using the American press to expand propaganda.
The president of the United States Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the paid allowance of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of attempting to enter into the United States Congress, which will take place on 6 November — China denies this charge.
Trump's assumption that Beijing tried to intervene in the United States elections confirmed what American officials said to Reuters that this is a new stage in escalating the Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal that foreign governments provide commercial advertising promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to an increase in customs duties on mutual import.
China’s retaliation rates at the beginning of the trade war were intended to touch exporters in such states as Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump Party, found Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States of China, and former Iowa State Governor, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad stated in the article in the Des Moines Register Sunday, that China “now with double power begins harassment by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press”.
“Acrossing its propaganda, the government of China enjoys a respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, putting a paid advertising in Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
For this, the kiosk on the street in Beijing will not find any votes of opposition, and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinion that the Chinese may have on a worrying economic direction defended by China, given that the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans contrive themselves before the mid-term elections of women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh Aphere, warn analysts
While many of the leading Republicans support and support the weapons nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several charges for sexual assault, the analyst warns that the members will meet you during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions accompanying this event are extremely large, and most of the Republicans already officially want to vote.
“This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of politics at Maxwell School, Syracuse, published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he had doubts about whether senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) was trying to conduct an investigation by the FBI at the last time, enough to calm down the angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it until November,” Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday, an older adviser and spokesperson of the national progressive group MoveOn, says the newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, protesters scanned the word "The coming November", demonstrating in the Senate Hole because of the decision by the Republicans controlling the Commission of the Court of First Instance on the absence of Kavanaugh's nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statements, as he gave Mic.
“The field of democratic enthusiasticism and motivation will go beyond the scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“ People say he was already tall, and it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided women from suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which she detailedly described her sexual assault charges to the address of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the candidate, this would be a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party must deal with a slight mess,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee last week, as the NBC News says.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be chosen, it is also the way the Republicans have dealt with this situation and the Ford have dealt with," said on one of Guy Cecil's information channels, the director of the United States' priorities, the group that helps the Democrats to choose.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided about whom to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a little more support from the latter.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the respondents strongly or rather believed in Ford's statements, while 35 percent claimed that Kavanaugh's statements were firmly or rather believed.
Moreover, 38% of respondents claimed that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lied during the submission of statements, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI started an investigation of the charges raised by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor who is Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian reports.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senace Commission, that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominated to the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web network creates a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest design of technology legends, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform — Solid — the Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the purpose of creating Inrupt is "dominance over the world".
"We have to do this now," he said, referring to startup.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid Platform technology to enable people to create their own "on-line store with personal data" or otherwise under.
It can include contact lists, lists of things to be done, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the online store with personal data is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal reinforcement through data".
According to the company president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Today, Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed for the project and the community of volunteer developers.
Since this week, technology makers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn up every day with all their business models.
"I don't ask them for permission."
On Saturday on the medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform".
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when World Wide Web Consortium founded it in the Technology Institute in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has dealt with a lot of debate on the neutrality of the network.
By calling for life Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think about the next time in the network development," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Destiny of the Clergy Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, who was awarded the Cross of Victoria during World War I, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Reverend Bernard Vann was appointed on 29 September 1918 for attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren revealed a stone commemorating during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that uncovering the stone exactly on the hundredth anniversary of grandfather's designation was “extremely symbolic character.”
As stated on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann made his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire from the field and machine guns”.
He then stepped up to the line of fire, and with the “best courage” led it forward, and, in a single way, he attacked the post office of the field, disrupting three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72 years) said his grandfather’s actions were “someone why I would never be able to cope, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he filed a vin after the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to attend the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support of many people.”
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala instead of getting Świnka Peppa.
Imagine you haven't slept all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala of emotions and finally unable to see the main fight.
The gala program in San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main chart, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared to fight, the viewers in the UK were shocked by changing the program to Świnka Peppa.
Some were disappointed after they hadn't slept in the early morning hours specifically to see this fight.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in cartoon for children as a "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the government's regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate for it to be released at 6:00 a.m., thus changing the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, the older Vice President of the Marketing and Communication of Bellator when he was asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Swine, yes."
The President of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they'd work out a schedule to take account of viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think of the recurrence of the situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
“But it is Sunday six in the morning, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we had a lot of comments that none of them sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was technical failure.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise you, this is not gonna happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — to a standard amount, and we were too much to please fans and unfortunately overdone.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse because of sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old said he didn't realize that they weren't all like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs station 4, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give others "nadziei".
He also said that he was a parent that made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
It's been a habit of running this programme for many years of the program, Kirsty Young, taking a few months off due to the disease.
Having appeared in the program for the first time conducted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt “lower worthy” from others, because “common love for boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said: “Today this feeling of less value and being another is something that gives me strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was “something worth” not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The 2nd brown Olympic medalist became a loud activist of the LGBT community and used its performance at this year's Community Games of the Nations in Australia to appeal to more countries about the decrimination of homosexualism.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to live open, without implication, and he wanted to give others “nadziei.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American Dustin Lance Black filmmaker, who met him in 2013, was “satisfactory.”
Daley married the Oscar (which is 20 years older from him) last year, pointing out that this difference of age was never a problem for him.
“When you're going through so much as young,” he meant his first Olympic age at 14 and father's death for cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar heights and falls.
The couple stayed in June by the boy's parents named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley said that his perception of certain things has changed completely.
" Last year, the most important thing was to me to get the gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had the Olympic tickets in London in 2012 — he wanted to take place in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, “you will not be with us to be in the first row, Dad” he said.
“I took his hand when he stopped breathing, but only when he stopped breathing and died, I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
In the next year, Daley participated in the Olympic Games 2012 and won the bronze.
“I knew that it was what I dreamed of my whole life — to jump to water before the crowd of people in the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling of the possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud in the implementation of Heather Small — which accompanied him during preparation for the Olympic Games and which continues to make him goose skin.
The Desert Island Discs program is released at the BBC Radio 4 station every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no form of Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday part of the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when it will play his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form so that she won't push her fifteen.
Mickelson, playing for twelve every two years in the event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Saturday four-ball and foursome.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-krieg winner had to spend a day challenging the team and working on the improvement of his game in the hope of correcting the cause of his reference to the bench.
A 48-year-old who never gave the easiest hits, even at the peak point of his career, does not work well on the tight field of Le Golf National, where mistaken strikes are ruthlessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraged enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday he must face the precision of the winner of British Open — Francesc Molinari who joined forces with the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with the jaw, Mickelson's game can be extremely key.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player — he could probably have done nothing else.
“He fully understood his role today, knocked me back, covered me with his hand and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“He is very confident.
He's in the galleries of fame, and he's put a lot in the game of his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think she'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it happened, and we had to do it anyway.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record on the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never compared his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins on his account, 20 failures and seven draws.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, laughing, and it's good to have him in the team's room," he explained.
“ I think young players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings a lot more than a game."
Captain of the European Group, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a large point advantage may soon be cramped
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the start of the single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily transform into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 at the Valderram field, where he and his companion vice-capitan Seve Ballesterose had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by the shortest of possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We can't forget that we had a great advantage in the Valderram field; we also had a great advantage in the Brookline field where we lost, and in the case of the Valderram field we won only about the hair" said Bjorn, on the picture, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave the lead of 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow, you're giving everything out of you.
Get out there and do whatever's right.
The end will only be when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal to get a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said from the beginning that I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who people are on the opposite side — the best players in the world."
Bjorn, thrilled by how his players managed in a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do it better.
But tomorrow, that's different.
Tomorrow they're single, and that's another thing.
It's good to play with a partner when everything goes in mind, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limits of the possibilities.
It's a message that needs to be handed over to the players, it's going to give them everything tomorrow.
The partner also has to give out everything."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect from his players to achieve better results alone than in playing with a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Furyk himself experienced large returns on the last day, being a member of the winning team in Brookline field, and then failed after the European team had done the “cudu in the field of Medinah”.
"I remember every word," said in response to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, he warmed up for the fight of his players on the last day.
“We are playing 12 important games tomorrow — you would like to start playing fast, as it happened in Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this momentum goes one way, it's gonna get a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our composition properly and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was entrusted with the task of conducting a counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy at the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European team players in the leading half of the program.
"I decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he'd be able to handle all the games," Bjorn said about his single choices.
New German warship again delayed
The latest fregata of the German navy should be put to use in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the cold war, but this will not happen until the next year because of defective systems and intimidating costs, as local media provided.
The reference to the use of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new class fregata of Baden-Wuerttemberg, was moved to the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of the military ombudsman.
The ship should be included in the navy in 2014, but due to the problems that occurred after delivery, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
The four class units of Baden-Wuerttemberg ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen fregats.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful division, a series of anti- and anti-road missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, including reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between preservation — the operation of new fregats should be possible even for two years from home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that these modern warships to allow Germany to respond to situations abroad, when the service starts, they will already be overdose — reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate fregata F125 appeared on the first page of the newspaper last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship after the shipment.
It was not much known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media informed about a series of key software and equipment which made the ship useless in the battle mission.
The software defects were particularly relevant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is half less than for the Bremen class's older fregats.
It also turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and reduces the possibility of a navy to carry out future modernisation.
It is believed that the weighing 7000 tonnes of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” ship is twice the harder than ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the whole project — including crew training.
It is said that it reached a stunning level of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of putting new fregats into use are particularly important in the light of recent warnings regarding the power of the German sea fleet to shrink.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, admitted that the sailors “the ships capable of use are over.”
He also said that this problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal of the operation of old units without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his displeasure with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
The new research carried out in the Scotland Highlands area aims to show how bats use the landscape during the acquisition of food.
The results of the research are expected to drop new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help target future measures to protect them.
Research conducted by scientists from National Trust for Scotland will concern polish and tiny carols, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of red nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key places around the estate, special registerers will be deployed to track the activity of bats in the whole season.
Employees and volunteers of NHS will also carry out surveys in the field using portable detectors.
The experimental sound analysis of all recordings aims to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how to behave individual species.
The habitat map and the report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on the scale of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Advisor in NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are key to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of the work related to the management of habitats, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forestlands for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have significantly decreased over the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development works which have an impact on the depths and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also be a threat, like flies sticks and certain chemicals used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of the night’s hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching gains.
They use complex echolocalisation technique to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of the earth throughout the country, treats bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, guarantor checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even founded the first and only dedicated reserve of bats in the territory of the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is a home for eight of ten Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the property manager, says it is a perfect territory for bats.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other estates will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of control for bats prior to accession to preservation activities in the estates, as unintentional destruction of a single yarn can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected — killing, harassing or interrupting them, and destroying their heads is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotch Officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public's opinion to assist.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in the case of many species, we don't even know how to handle their populations."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the rape charges against him as “fake news”, saying that people want to “promote” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German information magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of raping the American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the Friday reports, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the announcement of the charges, in the instagram live message addressed to his 142 million followers, identified these reports as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said the five-piece golden ball player.
“ They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," he added a soccer player with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel's magazine in connection with the charges they called “an unacceptable statement of suspicions in the area of privacy” as Reuters says.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer will demand compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The project took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After meeting at Ronaldo and Mayorg's nightclub, they said they went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped an analytical woman, according to the documents submitted in the Clark County Court district court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged collar and told her that "99 percent is a good guy", which was visited by this "one percent".
According to the records, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was under mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police, and that her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because “she was afraid of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement now, because she can't forget the alleged event.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Juventus after paying for it 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain would "every time regret" leaving car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “happily regret it all over time,” if after leaving the European Union she had lost the status of the world leader in car production, Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that “satisfied him,” when the representative of Toyota UK said in the BBC interview, that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, the production of the Burnaston factory near Derby will be temporarily suspended.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the absence of agreement on Brexit could lead to reductions in jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis are produced last year, produced almost 150 000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
"In my opinion, if the United Kingdom comes out of the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then it will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its Mini car factory in Oxforda month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as the car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain when the European Union is abandoned by the Great Britain without agreement.
The Toyoty production line operates on the "just-in-time" principle in which parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU in the case of cars produced on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to the industry, can lead to the delays and deficiencies of the part.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to last more than one day without supplying it to his factory in Derbyshire, which would have stopped production.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresy May plan on future relations with the EU was "precisionly designed to avoid border control".
“We need agreement, and we want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy our current success, but will also allow us to make use of this situation properly,” said BBC Radio 4.
"Declarations not only toyoty, but also other producers show that we need to be able to continue what consisted of a very efficient set of supply chains."
Toyot's representativeship was unable to determine how long production would be stopped but warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the Board of the Unite Group, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if work is to be erased, they will never be restored.
The Ombudsman said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, as the White House says
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "as late for another week" due to the continuing fight for the candidate for the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh, as he gave the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of a special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the possibility of Russian interference in elections, the link between the close co-workers of Trump and Russia and the potential impediment of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump has fired the Deputy Attorney General, threatening the same independence of Mueller, has been a hot topic for months in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times journal reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing wires to record Trump's conversations, as well as the possibility of removing the president from the position based on the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denyed those reports.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he was going to resign.
The deadline for the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. It came to pass the meeting to avoid interference with the hearing of the Senate Court, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in Senate.
Trump's pressman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at the Fox News station.
When asked for a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been established, it may take place this week, and it can be moved for another week, taking into account all events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll be sure to inform the press."
Several journalists contested the statement: Sanders had not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Chris Wallace, running the program, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences is not caused by the reluctance to "ostentative" television journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentative."
She suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President of the present conducts more questions and answers than any other president before him,” said, adding: “We have met numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to be held, said Sanders, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We're trying to do this regularly, and we've done this very often in the last few weeks. Press conferences will take off such sessions, during which you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with hostors.
Solar press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too free and sometimes strangely before the gathered journalists.
The Minister for Health writes to workers from the EU countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit's concerns
The Minister of Health made a letter to workers from the EU countries employed in the Scotland Health Service to give them thanks from the country and to ask that they do not leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scotland Parliament member, sent a letter for less than six months until the UK left the European Union.
The Scotland Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of processing applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “This summer, negotiations on the exit of Britain from the European Union have been continued, and the appropriate decisions will be taken in autumn this year.
The UK Government also intensified preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing period for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat again, how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of its nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and outside have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health work and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passes the surgery due to a head injury trauma
The Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, has undergone an operation as a result of the injuries of head trauma in the Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with the failure of the team from Tennessee with results 31-27, informed Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told the journalists that the player suffered a trauma shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the sideline, and then climbed to the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed it on the noses and carried out further studies.
The Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no further details on the type of injury/risk of injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second year student freed from representing universities for a year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game ends, he had five rifles, which gives him 18 rifles throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher tax charge when buying real estate in the UK
In line with the new plans of the foreign buyer's tours, higher taxes will be charged for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom.
This move is to destroy the success of Jeremy Corbyn's actions to attract the young electorate.
The increase in taxation will cover those who do not tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury foresees that this way it will obtain up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless aid.
Theresa May will inform today that foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be charged with a higher tax and thus additional appropriations will be allocated to homeless aid.
This move is taken as an attempt to destroy Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young elect promises of cheaper apartments and increase the burden on more earners.
Higher taxes will be required by individual and non-tax companies in the UK. Additional measures are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee — besides the current tax, including two years ago, higher rates for the second houses and rental apartments — can be at least three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move will allow you to get even 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, which leads to price increases and hinders the purchase of first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate, and most of the time spends outside the country, many rich regions — especially the capital — have turned into “the city of spirits.”
The new rules are only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in taxes to help young people buy the first house.
He also called on Prime Minister May to abolish the limits of low-cost housing in order to eliminate the "scandalu" in the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rental regulation and the end of the "free" expedition.
He also wants to grant local governments more authority in building new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I will be involved as the Prime Minister in rebuild the British dreams of making life better than the previous generation.
This also means the repair of our enormous housing market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estates here that are hard working British residents.
For too many people the dreams of his own home have become very remote, for this humiliation related to the need for nighting on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to be a Scottish selector"
Sunderland team coach, Jack Ross, says his "most ambition" is to be a Scottish selector at some point.
This 40-year-old Scott with commitment is working on the healing of the North-East Club, which currently takes a third place in League One with a three-point loss in relation to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after the last season he introduced St Mirren's club back to Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player,
but I only managed to get to kadra B" said Ross in an interview for BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“ As a child, I watched Scotland game with my father in Hampden, and it always attracted me.
Such a possibility will only come if I succeed as a club coach."
Among the predecessors of Ross at Sunderland Coach, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Coach Alloa Athletic claims that he is not feeling overwhelmed, taking the role of such well-known personalities in such a large club, rejecting the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Today, success will be measured to me whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
In view of his structure and its amenities, it is undoubtedly his place there,” he adds.
"It won't be easy to do, but I'm sure I'm going to feel a success here, only if I can do it."
Ross's coach career is only three years old. He was a coach assistant in Dumbarton and for 15 months he was a Hearts coach team.
He then helped Alloa again to promote after degradation to the third league, and in the next season he led St Mirren from the edge of the decline to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he's feeling much more comfortable now than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real return point,” he recalls that he had been given his position to Coach Allo.
“I really believed that I am much better at running the team than playing.
It'll sound weird, because as a player, I've been doing a good job, and I've achieved some measurable successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week, you have to get through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure on coach's work, but I feel good about this part.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it, and I can say at this point I feel the most in place in my entire adult life."
All interviews at Sportsound can be listened on Sunday 30 September in Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best beer serving is 17:30 a.m. on Saturday
Summer heat wave caused a violent influx of customers to British pubs, but it became a quest in the restaurant networks.
Studies have shown that in July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting company, who developed the data, says: “The current heat and longer than expected the participation of England in the World Championships, caused the results from July to be shaped like the June, when the turnover in pubs rose by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the salary of restaurants fell even more.
In June, the decline in sales in restaurants in July increased even more.
Suppliers of pubs and bars have done the best — their increase in sales has exceeded the decline recorded in restaurants.
Powders serving food also suffered during heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and the food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman from RSM for the analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry says: “These results are in the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the volume of consumption of 'domestic' are weather and major sports or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks experience difficult moments, not surprisingly, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly affected consequences when taking into account constant pressures on cost reductions.
Long and hot summer came at the least beneficial moment for owners serving food and time to show whether the temperatures we had in August will bring the necessary inspiration."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is involved in monitoring the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses productivity data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has secret accounts in social media that he hides from his parents
Studies have shown that one for five children — some at the age of 11 — has secret social accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers
The survey among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of pages “fake Insta”
These news emphasizes the fear that sexual content published on them
Twenty percent of pupils claimed that they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children — some at the age of 11 — holds social accounts that they do not reveal to adults.
The survey among 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
These news emphasized the concerns that these accounts were intended to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of pupils admitted that he runs a "main" account that shows to his parents and also has private accounts.
One of the mothers, who accidentally encountered the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who ordered others to " rape them."
The study carried out in independent schools by the Digital Awareness Agency UK and the Association of Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of pupils from 11 to 18 years of age lead two profiles. Half of them are granted to maintain private accounts.
President of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers create their place on the Internet where parents or teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics board
During the annual Scottish Athletics Council meeting, Eilidh Doyle was elected as Executive Director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most titled Scotch light-athlete. The president of Ian Beattie identified this move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from its rich international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect for the Scottish, British and worldly light-athletes, and we are sure that the introduction of it to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish scottoathletes,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very happy that I will be able to give the council the vote of athletes, and I hope that I can really help in managing sports in Scotland."
The American, who, among his four golden Olympic medals, has a victory in the races at 200 and 400 meters on the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and now regularly plays in BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke one month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was time to show if I could get back to work and to what extent.
It was a creativity job, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again and I went back to training!
Thank you for all the support words!"
Advertising lactators that compare mothers to cows raise extreme emotions on the internet
The lactating company caused a storm on the Internet by publishing a commercial that compares breast-feeding mothers to milked cows.
In order to announce the introduction of a "first in the world of silent lactator to wear under clothes", its producer, Elvie, published a stunning advertising in the form of a video that underlines the freedom that he provides to his mothers.
It presents four true mothers dancing in a filled sian of both the songs, in which you hear the words "Yes, I touch, but you can't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice, it's not just my tits."
Refren goes like this: "Pump them, pump them, feed them, pump them out, pump them, pump them out, drink your ladies."
The advertisement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, triggered major controversy on the Internet.
The film now has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them say it is inappropriate to be joking with the "horroru", which is happening in the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans to give milk, they must become pregnant and have a calf, with their children being taken away after a few days from birth," he wrote one of the users.
Elvie lactator can be carried without notice under the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both mother and child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers that can keep their children."
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely distracted from reality.”
Other weapons of the video — one of the women said that she thought the song was “a funny one.”
“ I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one of these.
I felt like a cow when I was taking food.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for another bottom in it.
It's a brilliant invention" — someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny ad to mothers who take away food ( often at work or toilet) and feel like 'crow'.
It is not intended to praise or criticise the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, women danced with lactators with discreetly attached to the breast.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie lactator is completely silent, there are no cables or pipes and you can wear it under the breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep children on their hands, and even leave the house while eating.
Ana Balarin, a partner and a creative director at Mother, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a brave and provocative premiere.
By putting together feeding women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges that relate to the removal of food, presenting in a funny and coherent way the amazing sense of freedom that he provides.
It's not the first time Elvie lactator hit the newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week during the show Marty Jakubowski appeared on the runway the mother of two children with the same product attached.
Hundreds of immigrants' children were secretly transferred to the tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is rising rapidly, although the number of persons crossing the border does not change properly every month, because it is partly due to the fact that the raw rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children at sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually unauthorised immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they report for a child.
Such risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that from potential sponsors and other adults living in the common holding fingerprints will be collected to the immigration authorities.
Last week, an older official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who volunteered to be sponsors of children left unaccompanied.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests were not previously recorded.
“Near 80 percent of people who are sponsors or reside with them in one household are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal history.
That is why we are constantly chasing them," said Albence.
Employees of the shelter say that in the efforts to accelerate the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in the court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as it happened according to previous standards.
Many will be faced through videoconference, not personally, to ask the judge of immigration to legalize their status.
Those which do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter and the reports published in recent months, the longer the children are in custody, the easier they may become unsatisfactory or depressed, which in turn can lead to aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenders found that these problems were even more serious in the case of larger centres such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is easier to miss signals that something bad is happening with the child.
They also added that the transfer of children to the tent camp without giving them the right time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can increase the trauma with which many of them are already fighting.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to immediately withdraw
During the speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, also called refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in this country has been eight years.
Moual, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “we will deal with them accordingly.”
“They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” said the assembly.
Moual argues that the “war with terrorism almost ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “keep his holy battle until he cleanse the territory of Syria” from both terrorist groups and “all foreigners on it illegally.”
At present in Syria there are around 2000 American soldiers who are mainly trained by the Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President of Basszar al-Asad and consulting them.
In addition, more than 1,000 French soldiers are found in a destroyed war country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moual said that the conditions are good enough to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “an inaccurate fear,” which discourages them to return.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help in these returns,” he said.
"They are politicians of matters that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad has concluded with the opposition of a political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance.
The UN Diplomacies say that the last agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large bastion of rebels in Idlib has created the possibility to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent the large attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
Moual, however, stressed that the agreement had a "explained time frame" and hoped that the military action would be measured in the jihadists, including the fighters connected with the Al-Qaida Front of the Defence of the People's People's Defense of Lewant, who would be "eliminated".
The UN messenger, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon set up the first meeting of the new committee from the members of the governing party and opposition to develop a post-war sketch of the Syrian constitution and prepare for elections.
Moual defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘to verify the records of the current constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the elections again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020, unless, as much as he hopes of many liberal observers, his presidency will end earlier with the removal of office and scandal.
It would undoubtedly be the "the most dramatic final of the President's presidency so far".
So far, there's no sign of viewers' fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings have doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC channels have almost tripled, up to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average, it attracts 2.4 million viewers in the hours of the greatest rating, which is an increase in 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC channel programme "The Rachel Maddow Show" has reached the highest results among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening information programs.
“People are flying like moths to fire — this is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the main producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor” about the secretary of the office, who, after the attack on the Capitol, becomes president.
Nell Scovell, experienced comedy creator and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
He mentions how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why? ” she asked.
“ For he makes me laugh, ” he answered.
‘Chaos has a entertainment value’.
Of course, the reports from Washington could justify the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admirations of the families of immigrants or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you've been watching a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's secret informants when writing a book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's skin jacket for $15,000 (the predator of pride overloaded houses), as it is stated by The Washington Post) or about implications of shocking details of the anatomy of President Trump revealed by Storma Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
“What he does, partly reminds the reality show in terms of providing new content every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, Director-General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of the “Pawn Stars”, about changing obsessions and daily returns of the Trumpa event (as an attack on NFL League players or the praise of Kim Dzong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're going to be late.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai, where she had her house, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just before the Senate Court and was weighed by the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs before, and people said "it's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Impact of money from outside to election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganisation of electoral districts, the result of which, in the race, two congressmen now in office, flows to the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania, a river of cash.
This recently established suburban district of Pittsburg is represented by the Democrats Congress, the Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely covers the new district 17.
Maps of districts were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were dishonestly appointed, which gave the advantage to the Republican and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district of 17 began with the fight to finance campaigns between the main funding authorities of the party — the Committee of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning with the hair in the wide commented elections to the 18th electoral district held in March.
In this post for more than a decade, he has been in the Republican, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China, but they dropped out of this idea.
Diplomacy noticed that Dominican and Panama have already recognised Beijing, despite the light opposition to Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varel, and until the team managers of Trump Organization had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke the Heads of the US diplomatic missions from Salvador, Dominican and Panama because of “the recent decisions to cease the recognition of Taiwan”, as she said in her statement from this month, the deputy spokesman Heather Nauert.
However, the sanctions considered were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received 140 million dollars from the United States, among others, aid for drug fights and support for development and economy.
Proposed sanctions which would include restrictions on financial assistance and granting visas to certain persons would be very affected by this Central American country that faces a large unemployment rate and a high rate of murder.
In the course of the progress of international meetings, the North American and Central American officials set up a high-level conference to address the conclusions of a similar assembly last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, the officials of the highest level have clearly stated that they want the conference to take place, thus cutting any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Diplomacy say that at the conference, which is currently scheduled for October half, the vice president Mike Pence is to be a signal to be invited to the assembly of representatives of the administration.
Three American emissaries returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican. There were no new stringent communications or punishments from Washington.
The Ombudsman of John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debates presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal pertraktations, provided that they were anonymous.
Their relationships were confirmed by an external analyst from the environment of administration, who also said anonymously.
Learn History
Another element could be the report by the Special Attorney, Robert Mueller, on the possible impediment of the judicial activities by President Trump, for which there are currently concrete evidence available publicly.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examined whether Donald Trump's campaign had something to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes, President Trump will be held responsible in preparation for a recurrence before the voters, and perhaps even be judged before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that Trump’s fall — neither in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that decides how long it can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to assassinate Hitler, if the West would resist him and support the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the possibility of avoiding the years of slaughter that occurred after that.
The rounds of history rotate around such feedback points by speeding up or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are several such feedback points in front of the Americans right now.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires DA Rod Rosenstein, the man that depends on Robert Mueller's future investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we discovered in our papers that last year he offered a secret footage of the president and speculated that he was not suitable for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the relationship presented by The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly ordered FBI investigations regarding Brett Kavanaugh are incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed as judge of the Supreme Court, despite credible charges for sexual assault and false statements?
First of all, will we choose in the half of the presidential term to the Congress of those who will bring Donald Trump to account?
If we don't get through these trials, there'll be hard times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czechoslovak, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my ambassador residence.
She survived, she emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the shabby candles on that table marked by swasty.
With such heritage, how could I not look optimistic in the future?"

Rangers, Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for a match with the Rapid Vienna team
The Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory with Austrians after an impressive villareal draw this month in Spain will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until the 2:2 draw from the Villareal knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing the game this season, but he believes that this result will work on the Rangers like a trampoline for greater success.
“We did it well because Villarreal is in good shape,” said a 31-year-old.
“ We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something, and we fought the point.
Perhaps at the end we could still press them, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As for Thursday, it's another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent has obtained a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will get through and we will fight a positive outcome.
The last year was definitely hard because of everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we're all good at our place.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings spends women dreams with eyelids
Although people in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, few of them talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said that she spoke to her spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to take care of them as a family member, but do not discuss this matter,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide selling life insurance.
Where do you start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you express your will before you.
Together with the adviser and family, discuss where and how you want to take care of you, because this choice will be an important factor in determining the costs.
Ask for help from the financial adviser: He can help to find a way to pay these expenses.
The long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property, if you have it.
Prepare the legal documents: You will prevent the trial battles.
Set a trusted healthcare attorney who will supervise it and ensure that the relevant persons act in accordance with your will if communication is impossible.
Consider also the employment of an attorney who will take care of the finances.
Select a trusted person because it will take financial decisions for you and ensure that all accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your older parent suddenly needs medical help and he's going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write out all the information to be prepared.
“This is not just about finance, but about who the doctors are,” says Martin.
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth a plan."
Man repeatedly shot from the windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was shot from the windmill several times when he came home from the evening party.
Forty-year-olds were found in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe County, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police identified the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST time, as “casual action.”
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries taken are not threatened by a man's life, and the police are asking for witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that haunted the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday.
Due to the disconnected communication, the rescuers failed to obtain any information from Donggala cabbathene, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicentre of earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Palu disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the cabupathy of Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Celebes Central Province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to the estimates in 2017, 379 800 people were inhabited.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city had just held its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a cabupaten (administrative unit with a level below the province) extending along the northwest coast of the island over 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 there were 299 200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal area of Donggal.
Another source of provincial income is nickel mines, but they are mainly in Morali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Dismantling the effects of Katastrof in the last 100 years of earthquake and tsunami visited Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, tsunami, who hit Donggala, killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Nine people died as a result of tsunami in the western Donggali in 1996.
Indonesia is located on the active Pacific ring of fire, through which earthquake occurs quite regularly.
Greatest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake, which on 26 December haunted the western coast of the Aceh province in the north of Sumatra, caused tsunami that hit in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatry visited a series of strong earthquakes.
There were hundreds of people killed in the island of Nias at the Sumatra coast.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6,8 degrees, causing tsunami that came in the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra, the earthquake took place at 7.6 degrees.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake with a force of 7,5 degrees hit one of the Mentawai islands near the coast of Sumatra. It triggered a wave of tsunami about 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The flat earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's cabupathen in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the damages that caused fatal earthquakes and tsunami from 2004.
This time there was no tsunami wave, but more than 100 people were killed.
2018: Large earthquakes haunted the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing over 500 people, mainly on its north side.
They destroyed thousands of houses and brought temporary problems to thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested under domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaski and the vice president, Sara Palin, was arrested for assault.
According to the report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the town of Wasilla in Alaska, 29-year-olds were arrested against domestic violence, hindered the submission and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report the crime, he took her phone.
KTUU's station reports that Palin is in custody of Matt-Su and has a fixed bail of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood before the court, where in his defense speech he said he was “very innocent.”
Three class A offenses on the fuel, which means he can get a penalty even a year of prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also accused of class B, for which the penalty of the prison and fine of $2000 is at stake.
It's not the first time Palinov's criminal charges are being filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The matter is currently being held before the Alaska court for veterans' claims.

The earthquake of 7,5 degrees caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the middle of the island of Celebes, which is northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.

Federal Prosecutors demand a death penalty for a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York City
Attorneys in New York demand a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in eight people died, and it is a rare punishment — it has not been executed in this state for a federal offence since 1953.
For the attack that took place in October on a bicycle path running along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the 30-year Saipov allegedly used the rented truck Home Depot, which took off the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to the New York Southern District, the announcement of the intention of demanding the death penalty to justify the need for it, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims and caused serious injury to the body.
According to the court paper, both of these charges are at risk of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the federal jury attack, Saipov presented a 22-point accusation act, including eight murder charges under illegal activity, which is usually used by the federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors to organise the attack, it required "solid planning and thinking." The way Saipov carried it out, they described it as "creat, cruel, and immoral."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariela Erlija, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damiana Pagnucca” states the intentions.
Five of the victims were Argentina's citizens who stayed touristically in New York.
The last time about the death penalty in the south of New York was applied ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was considered guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard the life sentence.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Marriage was lost after two years before they were considered guilty of conspiracy and spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's lawsuit, which came from Uzbekistan, in months after the attack, he did not show any regrets.
The police say he told the investigator that he's fine with what he did.
According to Saipov's file, he confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films that he was watching on the phone to attack.
According to the police, he also demanded to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
The charge of 22 charges says he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders from the office representing Saipov, said that they were “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the prosecutor's decision.
“We consider that the decision to request a death penalty and reject life without the possibility of prior release after the guilt will only extend the suffering that these events brought to all the persons concerned,” he said.
Saipova's team asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty.
The tour Parliamentary says that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest, which took place during the toris conference, Nigel Farage vows “mobilized the army of the people.”
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians have to “feeling hot” from the eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentaries suggested that he should take responsibility for the negotiations with the European Union.
The deputy of the conservatives, Peter Bone, told the demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage was Secretary of Brexit, “United Kingdom would be already outside the Union.”
However, the addition of torques in favour of staying in the joint to a separate protest against Brexit, which was held in the city, even more emphasised the burden of reconciling its deeply divided ranks before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is striving to implement its compromise plan with Chequers among the attacks of the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies claim that despite opposition, she will seek to conclude the agreement with Brussels and will force the eurosceptics and the laburists to choose between its proposal and "chaose".
Peter Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "throw the plan out of Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the attorney to be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he did this, we would now be outside the Union,” he said.
Deputy Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers plan.”
By presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we fought in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to be our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestions that the citizens changed their minds from the vote in 2016: “The thought that the British changed their mind and wanted to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
The demonstration was also supported by Brexit Andrea Jenkyns from the toris party, who said to the reporters: “I am only saying, Madam Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not pleased with the general support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who populate the streets and who have chosen us do not support it.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In the speech to Prime Minister May, she added: “Presidents keep their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said that demonstration politicians must feel hot if they were to be cheated on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them "we will not let you do this."
He said, “I want you to make politicians who are at the edge of Brexit’s betrayal warm.
"We are mobilising the army of the people of this country, who has given us a victory in the Brext referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent, proud Kingdom."
At that time, the opposers of Brexit had traveled through the city to the center where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handkerchief of activists was waving with the "Torysi v Brexit" bangers after setting up a group this weekend.
Laboratory activist, baron Andrew Adonis, laughed at conservatives for problems with the safety of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are people who claim to be able to organise IT systems and all technology for the operation of the Canada plan plus, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren is planning to "reasonably consider" the president's candidate
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, he will consider the president's candidates seriously.
As The Boston Globe reports, the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke of her future during the meeting with the voters held on Saturday in the West Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will apply for the reelection in November. Her opponent will be the representative of the Republicans, Geoff Diehl, who was a co-conducting Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election Warren can defeat Trump.
Saturday's Holyoke event was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall formulation since Donald Trump took over the office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to candidate for the president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for the “womans to go to Washington to fix our broken government — and she also means a woman at the top.”
Arresting the perpetrator of the fatal shooting in which the LSU team player Wayde Sims died
The Baton Rouge police informed Louisiana on Saturday about the arrest of a suspect on the Friday shooting where a LSU basketball player died, Wayde Sims.
The police department in Baton Rouge informed about the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the conference held at 11:00 eastern time.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was published with a request for help in identifying the man on it.
Wayde Sims died from a gunshot near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot from firearms in the head, resulting in his death,” said the chief of the police, Murphy J. Paul, according to the service of 247sports.
Wayde was defended by a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the crime scene, he had a gun on him, and he shot Wayde.
After he was arrested, he was transferred to custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 1,98 m junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches, and he started 10 times last season, during which he spent on the park on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 collections for the game.
The Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team command allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas has been qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the command of Mercedes's team will have a great impact on the result of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and forced Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the site as first and let Hamilton ride in the tail of the peletone, which should decide about the fate of the race.
Mercedes's player went to the box in the next round and showed up for Vettel, but after the wheel action, which led the Ferrari driver unwillingly to leave the internal part of the track, risking pushing to the defensive after double movement of the rival to defend positions on the third turn, Hamilton went out to lead.
Max Versappen ran out of the end of the stake, and on his 21th birthday at the end of the first round, he was in the seventh place.
Then, through a large part of the race, he drove that he did not change tyres to make a quick finish and pick up Kimi Raikkonen the fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service point at the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds he couldn't make it faster.
“It was a hard day, because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend, and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team gave all of himself to take two first places," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body talk.
During the meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump cried with Senator Dianny Feinstein, who maintained that she did not reveal the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the judge of the Supreme Court of First Instance Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Commission of the Justice Senate, but he found that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "a sublime, meanly and lying".
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for a few days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, subtle, evil and lying, ” he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they tell us "oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her response... or did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, huh?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we have not revealed," he added, refreshing the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford with a description of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his content leaked in early September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford, I didn't reveal her history," Feinstein testified in front of the committee, as the newspaper The Hill reports.
"She asked me for discretion, and according to her request, I have not revealed these content."
However, her statement did not convince the president who commented on them during the Saturday meeting: “I am telling you, it was a really bad speech of the body.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Continueing defending the candidate at the Supreme Court Judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over all means of power.
Apparently, viciousness, maliciousness, they do not care who they have to destroy to take over power and control," said the President, according to the mediaite service reports.

Air traffic controller dies by helping hundreds of people escape from earthquake
Air traffic controller from Indonesia was shouted by a hero after he died, helping a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered missing after a large earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, calling tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area. Many people were trapped in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in a delighted tower of control flights at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He's been there to make sure that the Batik Air airplane (flight 6321), which was on the start belt, is safely off.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was gonna crash.
He died in the hospital.
According to the reports of the Australian ABC News spokesperson of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the control decision probably saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
“ This message broke our hearts, ” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of fatalities can reach thousands, and the national agency for declining the effects of disasters reports that the possibility of arrival in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We consider that the harvest of death is still increasing because many bodies are still underneath and cannot be reached,” said the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The tsunami waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial of victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes provide help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: “Ambulans are constantly bringing bodies.
There's no drinking water.
Small stores are smuggled."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is going to hurry to help survivors, but we don’t know what will happen.
It's already a tragedy, and it might be even worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia arrived in Palu, Joko Widodo, who asked the army: “I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
This year Indonesia has already haunted the earthquake that killed more than 550 people on Lombok Island.
Aeroplane disaster in Micronesia — Air Niugini Lines reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
Airlines serving the flight that crashed on a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, inform that one person is missing. Before they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a tonating plane.
Air Niugini informed that, according to the data on Saturday afternoon, they couldn't count one man who traveled with a ferral plane.
They ensured that local authorities, hospitals and investigators are trying to find him.
However, they did not reply immediately to requests for additional details on passengers such as its age or nationality.
After the airplane hit the water during the landing attempt on the island of Chuuk, the rescue of other passengers and crew members helped local boats.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
It is not clear what caused the catastrophe, but it is also unknown to its exact course.
The airline and the navy of the United States claims that the plane landed on the lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he's out of the belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
“This has helped us very much,” he said.
Jaynes said that he managed to get through other people reaching the water belt to get out of an emergency toning plane.
According to him, members of the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy informed that they were also helping seafarers who worked near to modernise the coast. They managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sinked around 30 meters.
According to the Air Safety Network database in the last two decades of airline crashes registered in Papui-New Guinea died 111 people.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. ended the presentation of evidence in the retrial process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, has been tested for many hours as a judicial officer in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how through cell phone records he opened the 29-year-old route of the defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received data on the location from various mobile phones, which showed that the feral evening Tellis was from Chambers.
When the data confirmed that when Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of the prosecutors, whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said, "He lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's statement that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records have shown that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details from the phone, as well as texts and calls.
“ He erased it out of his life,” Hale said.
The final speech of defense is to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it was likely that the jury will be transferred to the same day.

New York Nanny is prosecuting a couple for release after a "rasist" text-eye
The nanny from New York is prosecuting a couple for dismissing her from work on racist background after receiving a misrepresented text, in which the mother of a child complains that she is a "the next black person".
The couple denies that they were racist, comparing the lawsuit to the "tasting."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly consternated when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who was your first day at work in 2016, is black.
“ NEEE, COOLEJNA CZARNA OSOBA,” wrote to her husband in a text.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs Maurice twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized of a gaf, "screwed" she fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that a loving nanny, who is African-American, was wrong to do her duties, and also expected a nanny from Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment for the working day and was sent back to Uber's house.
Now he demands compensation for a grant of $350 a day multiplied for six months, for which she was originally employed with a residence, although she did not sign a contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," said Post paper on Friday, and she added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denies racism charges, claiming that the termination of cooperation with Mrs Maurice was justified, because after they offended her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent to her something she didn’t intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Post husband Joel Plasco.
“Would you trust your children to a person whom you have made you sad even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
By comparing the lawsuit to “crisis,” Plasco said that his wife had only two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you intend to blow something like this?
This is not very nice," said the investment banker.

The new letter reveals that the book publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not feel the connection with the talking mission
The author's daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the warm book was adopted, says: “It is hard to stand in the place of the person who read it for the first time before the book was released.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He claims that her father, who, before a little bear, inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a camera player in BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book release seems “sweet-sweet.”
The Paddington, who describes as a “very important member of our family,” says that her father was proud of his success in secret.
“ He was a quiet man, he did not worship, ” he adds.
“ But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child that had accomplished something — you feel proud of him, although it is not your merit.
I think Paddington's success has seen this way.
Although he invented it himself and created it, he always earned Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After she landed, she was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“Nad called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t get out of it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart action slowly stopped acting and were excreted from the body.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit there and wait for me to know that all this is going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was among other people.
I had to hold on to it."
In the end, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who has already grieved the loss of her daughter, came on board with other passengers, unaware of what torture she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head loose, and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an all-compassing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide are trying to defecate others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he got depressed.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day, ” he says.
The 45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a well pronounced chef about a contagious smile.
“They all knew his smile.
They always said he could brighten up every room for him."
But before he died, he quit working because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the effect of dominance."
Sharon Davis created cards, “to tell people that there are people to whom you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Do not sit quietly — talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years after her mother died.
“Nothing has said that he feels nasty, sad or something,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was already in a complete hole, and when the children opened presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with her: “It would break a hole in the family.
He's breaking us up.
But we have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in Italian because the FBI is investigating
“I thought that if we could actually get what he asked — a limited time investigation — perhaps we could achieve some unanimity,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday, and he added that he feared that the committee “departed” to the opposite camps, leading to the impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
All their resentment is due to the moment.
The elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — 6 November. If, according to the predictions, the Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a person to the highest court in the country will significantly slow down.
George W. Bush already lifted his headphone to call the senators and encourage them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and he met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in place, there will be a vote.
It's not sure if Brett Kavanaugh gets at least 50 votes of senators, which would allow vice president Mike Pence to break the impasse and put it into the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's government, the number of escapers from North Korea is down.
According to the words of the South Korea legislator since seven years ago, Kim Dzong Un took over the power, the number of people running from North Korea to South fell.
By quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Conciliation, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 escapes were recorded last year and in 2011 — 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more precise controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates taken by human smugglers.
Pjongjang did not make a public statement on this matter.
The great majority of refugees from North Korea are ultimately proposed citizenship of South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seoul since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border illegally exceeded over 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most are running through China, which have the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross it than a strictly protected demilitary zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, theoretically still in the state of war, has clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pjongjangu, where they had been talking about denuclearisation negotiations, which had before been dead.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dzong Unem, which was held in June in Singapore. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement to clean the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of America of lack of progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we unbiased ourselves as first," said Ri in the speech that the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugha "histeryk" and says he's not suitable for work at the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, "histeryc" and said that, of course, he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said these words during an interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted like this, she would be considered a "histeryka" - she said Pelosi about her response to the testimony that Kavanaugh had made in the Chamber of Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denyed the charges of alleged sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, when they were both teenagers.
At times, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions during his preaching speech, he almost screamed and lost his speech when he discussed family issues and high school years.
He also explicitly defended the Democrats from the committee, identifying the charges of "grotesque and coordinated attack on the reputation" organised by the liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by giving these statements, as well as by the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
She asked if she was trying to appeal Kavanaugh from the office if he had received the nomination and if the Democrats had won most in the Chamber of Representatives, Pelosi had hesitated.
“I say so: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also organize in that court where he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the district appeal court at the Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, Kavanaugh's possible decisions are concerned about the Act of Affordable Care Act or the process of Roe v. Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
During the Kavanaugh trial, he was missing questions about whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time to enter a hysterical, prejudiced person who will expect to say how wonderful it is,” she added Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It's the right diatrybag, the months and years of fury, and she can't throw it out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” she told me Gloria Stein 45 years later.
"It's quite frequent, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was the manager of a company has helped me, ” she said she was also crying when she was angry, but she thought that when she was upset and started crying, she talks to the person that she says to, “You think I'm sad, because I'm crying.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are admissible as a partly anger release because they are basically inappropriately understood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first jobs in a man-made office is how I once started crying out of inexcusable anger. One older woman, a cool driver I was always a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and moved on to the stairs.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they've taken care of."
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, then deputed to the Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrawed from the race, frustrated to Patricia's borders, she realized that she might actually consider the idea of a self-advertising president.
“It was not a thought-out decision,” she said to me, laughing, 30 years later.
"The elections had already taken seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has identified this situation as "Snow White and Seven Monkeys".
Since the campaign has been up for a long time, Schroeder has had a fund collection and promised herself that she wouldn't come to the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a battle sentenced to a loser.
She discovered that some of her followers who gave men $1,000 had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts? ” she wondered.
During the speech, in which she declared that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — gratitude for those who supported her, frustration because of a system that made it so difficult to collect money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger to sexism — that the voice put her in her throat.
“Maybe to think that I've been through a nervous breakdown, ” he recalls the press’s reactions.
“It may be thought Kleenex sponsored me.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
What benefits Beijing can bring to economic war between the United States and China
The fairs that began the US and China were delusional and even though the battles were still going on, in the long term the conflict between these countries can be beneficial for Beijing, the experts say.
The first warning this year was fired by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, putting duties on the key export goods of China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariff rates on goods of $200 billion ($150 billion) which led to taxation of half of all goods flowing to the US from China.
Every time Beijing was reciprocating in nature, raising duties on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US strike, and it does not appear to have the second economy in the world shortly resolved.
The need for Washington to withdraw means acceptance of demands, but the public slope of head before the United States would be too embarrassing for President of China, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays well with its cards, the pressure from the US trade war could in a long way strengthen China by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions to intensify economic chaos in some countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have ever given," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia's think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Syria is "ready" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding a country ruined by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, said that the conditions in the country are improving.
“The situation in our field is now more stable and safe, thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
Following the restoration of normality, the government rebuilds areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic shifts measured in their daily lives and means of maintenance will be able to return to it voluntarily.
According to the UN estimates, more than 5.5 million citizens have left since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to take help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the aid provided or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the U.S. team by 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National on the suburbs of Paris.
On European land, the United States has already lost once in a row and since 1993 they have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe regained the trophy when Thomas Bjorn was led by Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, gained 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the US.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who didn't go too well over most of the tournament, hit the ball from the bracket straight to the water at the 16th PAR3, giving the same game to Francesc Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shinyed through all rounds and became one of the four players, which since 1979, when it was the first time this tournament held in the current format, it managed to get the score of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranked player in Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the largest victory in Ryder Cup was Hiszpan Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and has gained 25.5 points of career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he believed me and chose me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It is the success of the entire team and I am pleased that I could help," Garcia said after winning the team from Europe.
It passes a stick to his family, John Rahm, who defeated a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, the result of 2&1.
“I feel amazing proud of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game, ” Rahm said 23 years old.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has 13-21-3 results in Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic, for one of the biggest players in all time, who won 14 of the most important titles and only resigned to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American composition, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We retreated.
The hats from the heads in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our board, Ryder Cup will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
