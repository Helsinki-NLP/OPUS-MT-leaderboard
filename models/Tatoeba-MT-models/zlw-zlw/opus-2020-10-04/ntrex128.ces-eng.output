The members of the Velvet Assembly are concerned that they will “look like Mupeti”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are constellated by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the title of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly, across the political spectrum, are concerned that the name could cause laughs.
One member of the Labourist Party said that his group fears that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For the reader outside of Wales: In the Welsh twp means a stupid and pwp is a poop.
On the other hand, Plaid said that the group as a whole is not happy and proposed alternatives.
The Velšan Conservative said that his group is approaching the change of the name "open mind" but noted that the MWP has close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter "w" is expressed in similar words as the letter "u" in yorkshire English.
The Commission’s meeting, which is currently preparing legislation for the introduction of changes in the name, stated: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be called will, of course, be on the members themselves.”
The law of the Government of the United Kingdom of 2017 has given the power to change its name to the Welsh Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public advice on proposals where broad support received the option to call the Assembly of the Great Parliament.
As regards the title of the assembly members, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or the WMP, but the MWP option received the biggest support in the public discussion.
The members of the Assembly clearly propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus may bring concern to the President of Elin Jones, which has to submit a draft legislation within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of members and the proposal for a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on the change of country name
On Sundays, voters will decide whether their country's name will change to the North Macedonia Republic.
All human votes should be resolved for decades of the ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens have long insisted that the name of the North Neighbourhood constitutes an entitlement to the Greek territory and repeatedly protest against the request for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is a opposer of the plebiscite on changing the name, declared that he would not follow the vote.
The representatives of the referendum, including the President of the Government of Zorana Zaeva, argue that the change in name is simply the price for entering the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silent because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
"The old people I spoke to say that he was on every corner of the bar and church," says Mr Adams.
"There's neither of these days."
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People meet today in a different way," he says.
"The bars are no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he fears that money from sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as their leaders expect, “and sooner or later will be where they began.”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such kinds of people who will not help the rest of the sanctuary in the quarter.
“The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” says, “and therefore soon the day when these churches are closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of churches.”
Both churches built a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building took over the Black Congregation, whose godliness took place not far from here.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was in charge of the retailers' fighter on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building strongly, but when the parishes of Father Johnson planned his rebuilt, they ordered the belly.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, called the bell play proudly "the names of the poor."
The expert who played the bell play in July called it otherwise: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first bell play in the world that played the black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger bell game in the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin's story of architects and builders has been complicit, some of which were called by the polite leaders of the church, other episcopic diocese.
The Council of elders – the Pharisees' Head of the Lacine Representatives – sent a letter in July of the Diocese, in which he expressed concerns that the diecéze “will try to pay costs” to the council of the elders, although the hiring of architects and builders that the diecéze sent was not attended.
Some of the parishes complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California, who was sweating for lobsters.
According to the official report, the shark attacked on Saturday and wounded a 13-year-old boy, who was diving for lobsters in California on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said the station KSWB-TV in San Diego, that he had sat with his friends about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he fell to him with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that the call first considered the joy of catching lobster, but then “it realized that he screamed “Kisses me!
He bit me!”
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had broken the entire area of the key bone.”
“I screamed, let all go from the water: “In the water is a shark!” Hammel adds.
The boy was in critical condition transported helicopter to the Children's Hospital Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
A sailor named Larry Giles at the press conference said that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was intended not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the hull.
Offices for investigations and security closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach 48 hours in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the cosmetics market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to stand up chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic streets in the style of a business house where specialised salesmen will be available.
In the context of a strong market in cosmetics in Great Britain, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and domestic needs falls, the cosmetics alleys will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
Investments in cosmetics are connected with the efforts of supermarkets to find use for shelves that have previously been used for TV, microwaves and domestic needs.
Sainsbury's states that it will double the range of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and for the first time indicates brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also get the existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees branding sites similar to those in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also reiterates its range of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, in two shops Saintsbury’s will be tested the concessions of a retail dealer of Fragrance Shop perfumes. The first such shop was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London and another year will be created in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards a daily shopping of a small amount of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to try more to attract people.
The Director-General of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that the shops will look increasingly like business houses, because the chain of supermarkets are trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount sales such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales from the Argos branch and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago. This increases the sale of food and acquisitions are even more profitable.
Previous attempt to convert the department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended unfairly.
At the beginning of the millennium of Sainsbury’s tested the joint undertaking with Boots, but the connection ended after the fight about the distribution of revenue from the sale of drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio, who owns the chain of the Lloyds pharmaceuticals.
Lloyds is planning to play his role by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four sales.
Sainsbury’s business director Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the appearance and style of a cosmetics alley to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and tempting environments, and the advantageous location means that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for £11 million.
The star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones series after the TV moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from the $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand so that she could focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and accessories to Truly.
The business of this couple was compared to the brand of Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The seven-year-old show moderator announced her departure to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was angry with the Dragons Den Peter Jones series by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the informed sources, Jones “waste” when the television star at the tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that, due to the new contracts – up to 1.5 million pounds – he will no longer be able to spend enough time on their brand of domestic clothing and accessories of Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of the Willoughby moderator at the estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When the seventy-four-year-old Willoughby at Instagram announced that Truly was leaving, Jones went out of Britain to one of his summer seats.
The unnamed source states: “Truly’s find was the most important priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future to ensure it for a few decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants completely shocked.
No one could believe what's going on on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a full warehouse of goods ready for sale in Marlow."
Experts believe that the departure of the show moderator This Morning, which belongs to the most generous British stars, could become millions in terms of a fat investment in the products from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and a possible further delay of the marking.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded a brand of Truly with Tara Capp in 2016 and the 28th-year-old Jones joined in March as Chairman of the Board.
Couple ride a vacation together, and Jones has 40% of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby is to become M&S Ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin for the I'm A Celebrity show in ITV.
The source close to Jones last night said, "We will not comment on his business."
“ And then we fell in love ”
He's been joking about the criticism he's getting from the journalists as a note that some consider to be a "unsuitable president" and how he positively speaks of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump answered his ridiculous “voice” voice.
"I didn't give up."
He pointed out that after their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump appreciated as a big step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea, Kim was interested in another meeting.
But the action on nuclear weapons was stuck at a dead point.
More than three months after the June sum of Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "relevant response" for its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the US continues in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the edge of the war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim according to him brought positive results – termination of missile tests, help to release hostages and return the remains of the American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing Kim about relations.
“It is so easy to behave as the president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people who would stand right here,” Trump said and showed the crowd in front of us.
The wool of tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
In the situation after the earthquake Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations, for example, have learned that there is no need.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboku's inhabitants were expelled from their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little challenging,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
The Save the Children organization is putting together a team that travels to Palu, but it is not clear yet that foreign staff can work here.
Mr Sutupo said that Indonesian activists evaluate the situation in Paulo to find out whether international organisations will be allowed to help.
Since earthquake occurs in Indonesia very often, the earth to anger of Mother Nature is still patheticly unprepared.
At Aceh, shelters against tsunami were built, but on other parts of the coast, it's not common at all.
It is likely that the loss of human lives has contributed to the apparent lack of siren warning in Paul before the tsunami, even though the warning was issued.
Even in the best time, traveling among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics are even more difficult.
The hospital ship that boiled in Lombok and helped victims of the earthquake is now moving to Paula, but it will take at least three days before the new calamite gets to the place.
Improvement of bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo and the president spent a lot of money on the road and railroad.
Next year, he's gonna try again for his election, but his government is experiencing financial failures.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectary tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority receive a more conservative form of faith.
The street fight between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already requested lives of more than thousands of people and dozens of thousands of people expelled from their homes.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool shot a counterpart against Chelsea

Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters before Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball on his left and fired the remote stick.
The bullet flew high and headed to the right upper corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped the jumping Kepu Arrizabalagu and ended up in the network.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible." Sturridge told the LiverpoolFC.com server.
"I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn't think much about it, and I shot one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
Attack Blues sent the passport back to Mate Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half the Liverpool.
Kovacic played the ball fast.

Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15 pm in London with Videoton in the European EUFA league.
The number of victims of tsunami waves in Indonesia increased to 832
As Sunday morning the Indonesian Castro said, the number of victims of earthquake and tsunami waves climbed up to 832.
The earthquake of force 7.5 hit on Friday, triggered waves of up to 6 meters and trapped many people in ruined buildings, said at the press conference the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The city of Paula, which has over 380 thousand inhabitants, was surrounded by ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of a woman's stabbing.

I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers whose onboard cameras could record something to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigations,"
Police spokesperson confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene who think they knew a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
The police told me that there was an investigation and now they're informing the relatives of the victims.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could go to the building or out of it.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament has recently become a hit because of a fight about "prescribe history"
His exile would be a merit for his fanatic puritan followers in the style of Taliban to destroy a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for a "craziness" and "the attempt to rewrite history."
The Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that one of the goals would become the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't even order the iconoclasm in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century."
The magnificent performance of Cromwell, the author of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century’s viewpoint and part of the historyography of the character that many think they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said the Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today a little less than the end of the 19th century, as the defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unsimilar historical debates.
It is true that the conflict in the mid-17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identifiable character that represents one side of this division.
His success in the Lord of the Protector is also worth a celebration and a reminder."
The killer pig broke a Chinese farmer
According to local media, the market in Southeast China was attacked and killed by a pig farmer.
As he wrote the South China Morning Post on Sunday, the man with the name “Yuan” was found dead with artery in a pool of blood not far from the liu-pchan-suej market in the province of Kuej-chou.
Swine fever is prepared to apply the pig vaccine to the pigs on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning in the Chinese province of Čching-chaj.
Allegedly, on Wednesday, he and his cousin came from Jün-nan's side province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
Next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the next drink was open.
He thinks there was a large pork with a blood cloud.
According to the information, in the forensic investigation, it was confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig farmer disrupted.
“The brother-in-law had his legs full of bloody and cracked,” quoted the journal of Guiyang Evening News, the cousin named "Wu".
On the surveillance footage, Yuan came to the market on Thursday 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed men did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was closed so that no one else could think of when the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Market leaders are allegedly dealing with Yuan's family on compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on people are rare, they have already happened in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts and a man critically wounded.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pigs squeezed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove him away to the farmer's wife.
After the Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoby said the station CBC News, that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "sunker".
“ They're just playing.
They're curators... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will bring a strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa's prediction is weakening and moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next days, but in Northern Mexico, and southwest of the United States, it will bring flooding rain.
At 5:00 AM, Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, which represents the hurricane of category 1, and was 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Rosa is approaching Baja California's Peninsula on Monday, it will be like a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture to the north of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity then, with the approaching low pressure blows in the next days, triggers massive rains in the southwest of the United States.
Reductions 25 to 100 mm locally cause hazardous floods, suti currents and possible land slides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause the precipitation to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially on the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the United States, especially above most of Arizona, the precipitation is expected to be 50 to 100 mm.
Under rapidly deteriorated conditions, the dispersed nature of the tropical rain may occur.
Due to the danger of tropical precipitation, it would be very unreasonable to go to the desert.
A strong rain can cause the canyons to become a wandering river, and storms will bring local bumping winds and flying dust.
The approaching scarf of low pressure will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the southern California coast.
There may be a total precipitation above 13 mm, which could cause smaller currents of the nipples and slippers.
This will be the first rainfall in this region.
Sunday night, and on Monday morning, the rain will be expanding to Arizona.
Tuesday, the heavy rain spreads to four corners and it will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperature throughout the United States, because the Arctic will start to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to a sharp temperature change in short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the difference is almost 11 degrees Celsia.
In the next few today, they will try again to extend the lasting summer warmth.
Most territories in the middle and east of the USA are expected to start the warm beginning of October with temperatures around 27 °C from south-east plans to a part of the north-east of the USA.
In New York City, it could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October high probability of overdirect temperatures in the east of the US.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview followed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six TV channels of a quarterly interrogative statement of the candidate at the Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual attack allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political patch situation continued and the voters interrupted the current programmes with reports on the sudden fifth reversal: the agreement that the senator mediated for Arizon Jeff Flake about the fact that the FBI would carry out a one-week investigation of charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court board that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had her at the high school drunken party and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh in his excited statement said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people have been followed by the Nielsen Agency.
The company counted on average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that have broadcasted statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at offices.
For comparison, it's like the number of viewers watching football games in playoff or the share of Oskars.
The Fox News Channel, whose modests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest observation from all stations when the Nielsen agency observed it during the full - day hearing on average, 5.69 million viewers.
Second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest continued even after the end of the negotiations.
The main character of the fifth drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this delicate Republican made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN cameras and CBS on Friday morning, they captured how the protesters shouted at him when he was going to take the elevator to the court panel.
CNN carried lively how he stood with his eyes and had to wear.
One woman said, "I'm standing here right in front of you."
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office made a statement, and before the door closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later lively broadcast when the judicial committee was to vote for the presentation of Kavanaugh nomination to vote in the whole Chamber.
But Flake said that he would only do that if the accusation against the candidate was examined by the FBI next week, which demanded a minority of the Democrats.
Flake partly persuaded interviews with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After interviewing Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May accused the criticism of Brexit "politics"
The Ministerial President Theresa May in the interview for Sunday Times accused the critics of her plan to leave the European Union that "politics" about the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Birmingham Conservative Party Conference on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to that with the Prime Minister on the headline, her former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose each other's duties is “a total senseless”.
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the case of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The police department in Baton Rouge said that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of second-grade murder charges.
The authorities published a video confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses in the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police got glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on it.
According to the police, Simpson admitted that Wayde was shot.
According to the defendant, bail was set at $300,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report, which states that the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the head and neck.
The department thanks the police unit for the refugees of Louisiana State, the Crime Laboratory of State Police, the Southern University Police and the local citizens for the help of the investigation that led to arrest.
The LSU director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for “he drank and striving for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Two-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
The Basketball Coach LSU Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death was a team of "haired" and "haired" him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
A volcano shaking ashes on Mexico City
The ashes that bounce from the volcano Popacatepetl hit the southquarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the activity of the vulcan increased and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of scatterings and concussions.
In the social networks there were pictures of the frontal glass of cars covered by a thin layer of ash in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in volcano activity located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake was shaken by Central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan, known as ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police met the Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesting for independence had been faced with the orderly police and thousands of people joined in competitive demonstrations on the opportunity of the first anniversary of the vote on independence divided by Catalan.
Full policemen blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder color after them. The one on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, the fights that the police had to use the shoebags had to come out.
Independence groups have been singing “We will not forget, we will not forgive” faced by protestors of the Union who called “Let Spain live”.
According to local press, 14 people were easily injured in protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, the tension in the region seeking independence remains still high.
The voters expressed themselves for independence from the great majority, but the participation in elections was low because the opposers fought them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the election rooms in violent conflicts throughout the region.
Independence groups remained outside on Friday nights to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstration has passed, but she had to choose another route.
The eighth-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer hopes in the prospect of obtaining independence for Catalan.
“We lived one of the best moments last year.
My parents were happy to be able to vote, but now we're in a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, even though the tightest victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan parties in support of independence had to fight to keep things in progress this year. Many of their most famous leaders either left themselves in exile, or waiting in custody for their share of the referendum organisation and subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old assembler Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and says that the conflict was blown by politicians on both sides.
“Situation is increasingly tense,” adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalyst leaders who have been waiting in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidatery in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression we witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after the crash of the car into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were trapped after they repeatedly hit the house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was a damage to the gate and the house itself.
One minute, maybe somebody shot a car out of a bowl.
Mengova hit Livingston win 1-0 over Rangers
First goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston, who went out of the lower division, shocked Rangers and only gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of 18 matches in the role of the manager of the club from Ibrox.
Trefa Dolly Mengy appeared decisive when Gary Holt's team came to Hibernian second place.
Gerrard's team has no victory in the Premiership League on the guest field and next Sunday will stand the first Hearts on which eight points lose.
Even earlier, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston expanded a number of games without defeating the division to six games, so the chief coach Holt, who has cut Kenny Miler off last month, hasn't tried a defeat.
Livingston didn't use a chance against the unmarkable guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before the goal, because his directity caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated his defense, but before the gate, he failed, then Alan Lithgow just missed Craig Halkett's head in the end of the gate.
The homes were enough to watch the Rangers play before them because they knew they could suffer from the standard situations.
And that's how the key goal came.
Against the Rangers was made free kick, and Livingston created a sculpture, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent out Mengu, who used the ball in the midst of the fine area and scored.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated in the possession of the ball, but domestic defense for them was inevitable, and Liam Kelly's goalkeeper usually didn't have much work to do.
The same image of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped the goalkeeper Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed another standard situation of Livingston.
In Livingston’s penalt territory, the centres that the players kept cleaning, and two penalt kicks came in – after Halkett’s attack on Glenn Middleton’s alternate and others for their hand.
Livingston Phenomene – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Fenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and on their way up they continue to overcome expectations.
Their style of game and manhood have almost changed since returning to the spies, but the great commendation of Holt deserves for how the team has been burying since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, he was doing a great defense, while Menga kept up on Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't touch these standards anymore.
Their ending was lame – only once penetrated on the home page – and for the Rangers it should be a wake because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan waited for a mixed arrival in Cologne
When on Saturday (29 September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all the same smile.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, whose aim is to correct the relations between NATO allies.
They have failed to make a number of topics, including human rights, freedom of press and the adoption of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
There is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey in this town.
For security reasons, the police prevented the crowd from meeting the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
There were hundreds of people – many of them were Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his politics and the German government’s decisions to welcome him in the country.
Controversial protests reflect the controversy of a visitor who some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocracy.
An accident in Deptford: Cyclist died after a car crash
In London, a cyclist died after the car crash.
An accident occurred at around 10:15 local time near the Bestwood Street crossroads with a busy Evelyn Street street in Deptford on the southeast of the city.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead.
There was only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the place of Saturday's tragedy in the Childers Street accident, when the driver left the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said that the police are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
Roads are closed, buses ride on replacement routes and engineers are advised to avoid this area.
Prison of Long Lartin: There were six overseers in trouble.
According to the prison office, six overseers were injured in riots in a male prison with high security.
The disturbances broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday about 9:30 local time and still lasted.
With eight prisoners involved in one wing, specialised overseers from the "Tornado" team were called.
Supervisors suffered light injuries and were treated on site.
The prison service spokesman said: “To handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, specially trained prisoners were trained.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
It was announced in June that the Principal ended up after the prisoner attack at the hospital.
And last October, order units were called to prison for serious disturbances in which the staff was attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dried can benefit)
It's not normal for Arizona to hit a tropical low pressure scar, but that's exactly what happens at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of the hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of floods.
The National meteorological service has already issued a warning before floods for Mondays and Tuesdays from Western Arizona for South and Eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go directly through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National meteorological service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones retained the status of a tropical storm within 320 km from Phoenix below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane of 64 km from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricane predict a precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the region of Mogollon Rim in Arizona locations up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Panties will probably fall 25 to 50 mm, with local sums up to 100 mm.
For those who do not endanger the floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing, because the area hit dry.
The floods are very serious, but these precipitation might even help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States just hit dry.
The weather.com server states that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor service, more than 40% of Arizona are at least “extreme dry”, which is the second highest category.
The way of the hurricane Rosa first leads to Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the force of the hurricane with the maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses power.
It is expected that he arrives in Mexico Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the falls will be strong, which is a great risk of flooding.
“In Baja California to Northwest Sonor, the total precipitation is 75 to 150 mm, with up to 250 mm,” states server weather.com.
Rosa then goes through Arizona as a tropical storm across Mexico north and on Tuesday mornings arrives at the Arizona border. Then she passes through Arizona and later on Tuesday night enters the South Utah.
"The main risk of Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very severely precipitation in Baja California, Northwest Sonor and the desert southwest of the United States," reports the National Center for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause fatally dangerous floods and sutin streams in the deserts and lands in the mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, and his condition is now “stabilised.”
As the police informed of Avon and Somerset, young men from 17 to 20 years of age were arrested at night in the area of Radstock.
Police officers are looking for witnesses who could have a record of what happened on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “excused the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the utterly irresponsible and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh was “excused by wickedness and anger” by the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, where he definitely and emotionally refused Christine Blasey Ford's commandment that she was a few dozen years ago when they were teenagers, sexually attacked her.
Ford also spoke at the hearing about her accusations.
The president on Saturday said that on that day “the American witnesses were Cavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage.”
He said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a validation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service on his account.”
Indirectly, the President attacked Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republic to participate in the elections in the mid term of office.
“ Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats decided to "support and obstruction."
The Consultant of the Republican Party told the CNN station that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the soil of the Chamber is expected by Friday at the latest.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people, and the number of victims still grows.
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit a large earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which confucated huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Palu, there were hundreds of people at the festival on Friday, but the coast shore hits up to six meters waves that many people killed and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami waves preceded the earthquake by a force of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat of tsunami came yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they fell waves for the victim," said the spokesman of the Indonesian Agency for the mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro's disasters in Jakarta.
"The wool tsunami did not go alone, took cars, claws, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said and added that before impacting on the coast, the tsunami waves on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He showed that some people escaped from the wave to the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Air photographs published by the Air Agency to mitigate disaster show many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences were shaken by the coastal town and Saturday.
The serum of earthquake was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released by spinal shocks was approximately 200 times greater than the force of the atomic bombs in Hiroshim during the Second World War.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could even enlarge the wave of tsunami.
Nugro described the damage as “experienced” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found enclosured under the ruined buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugro’s informed that the amount of victims and damage could be greater on the coast of 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Donggala, which is close to the epicentre of earthquake.
According to him, communication was “a totally protected without any information” from Donggala.
The Red Cross stated in his statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and added that their workers and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
"It's a tragedy, but it might get much worse," says the statement.
The Agency waited on Saturday a lot of criticism because she did not inform that Palu hit the tsunami wave, even though the authorities said that the waves came at the time of the warning.
On amateur footage shared on social media, it is heard that a man on the higher floor of the building is desperately warned by people on the street from approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes the coast hits the water wall that brings buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami wave caused a large electricity failure that interrupted communication around Palu, so the authorities could only difficultly coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army started sending freight aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transport of aid and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia climbed into more than 800.
That's too bad.
When the workers of the World Vision from Donggaly came to Paula, where the staff hiding in shelters from the office buildings built in the courtyard, they saw the paintings of destruction, says Mr. Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined homes,” he adds.
It's too bad.
When the auxiliary groups began the sad activities of helping disasters, some complained that foreign workers with great experience did not have to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, stocks and staff from abroad can begin to be flowed in place of calamite until the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the spokesman of the Red Cross of Aulia Arriani.
“When the government says “OK, this is a national disaster, we can start international assistance, but that is not the case.”
When Paul was in the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who were still missing, they still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that relieve the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who was trapped two days under the wrecks next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists at Asian games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, was his students.
"As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon said how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp competing from Palo who attended the beach festival.
His reports, but instead of a pair of blue ticks, ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means that the reports have not been delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26,750 while supplementing the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to the press release of the police department in Newport, the thieves took off 26,750 USD to Brink's worker in addition to the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car was ripping off an ATM in a fun complex and prepared to put more money into it.
When he did this, another man “was out from behind the employees of Brink” and stole a bag with money that was supposed to be placed in the ATM.
According to the press report, several suspects who fled, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in incidents.
Any information on the identity of suspects should be communicated to the police in Newport on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
The change announced on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
The 14-year-old West has been named Ye for a while, and he used a pseudonym as the name of his eight-year-old album that came out in June.
Change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should show his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she will replace Ariana Grande's singer, who canceled her participation for “cit reasons”, as the artist said.
West previously said that the word for him has also a religious significance, except for the shortening of the current professional name.
“According to my opinion, “ye” is the most used word in the Bible, where it means “you,” said West to hear the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with the radio moderator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's changed from Kanye, which means the only one, on just Ye, as a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
The name has changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names of Love (love) and Brother Love.
The former West co-worker, JAY-Z, too, wrote alternately with the co-contender and without him and with the big and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use an army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador committed that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that “he will never use the army to force the Mexican people.”
At the time the left-wing student movement spread across Latin America, soldiers started shooting people into peaceful demonstrations on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has committed to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who are studying and opening other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education is taking young into criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and the expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the US government have published notifications about the AI, even though the United States have no formal strategy for artificial intelligence as a whole.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan last year, according to which she wants to be an AI in innovation by 2030.
"Dvojiting the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the USA and looking for another breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Lee said this week in the CNBC interview that double funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the area of AI will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, "Supervelmoci AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new World Order", is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the '80s, he worked on the AI system, who overcames the best American player in the Othello game, and later he was the head of Microsoft researcher and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous technological competition of the U.S. government, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the US have to often work hard to get government grants, according to Lee.
"Academic tips don't deceive China, but corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies employ the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve the efforts in the area of AI, the United States of Lee could also help change in immigration policy.
"In my opinion, the holders of the PhD in the field of AI should be automatically offered green cards," he says.
The Chinese State Council issued the New Generation Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way, as the National Science Council and other governmental organizations give money to researchers in the USA, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Defence Department has set up this year a joint centre for artificial intelligence to engage partners from the sector and from the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of the Artificial Intelligence Election Commission.
And DARPA announced this month that it invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
As far as NSF Foundation is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not taken place for months.
Makedoncs vote in a referendum whether they want to change the country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the North Macedonia Republic, which would solve a few decades of old dispute with Greece, which blocks membership requests in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the North Neighbourhood constitutes an entitlement to its territory and therefore initiated the entry of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded in June an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opposers argue that the change is weakened by the ethnic identity of the majority Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign called for the fighter has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of the voters would be available to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you for NATO membership and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?”
The favourers of the change of the name, including the President of the Government of Zorana Zaeva, argues that this is the price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successive countries of former Yugoslavia, could enter an organization like the EU and NATO.
"I came to vote today for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," says the 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska of Skopje.
While the referendum is not binding, enough members of the Parliament said that they would follow the outcome of the vote.
The change in name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters finally gave up their vote.
"I voted for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are giving their votes in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, Strumici in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small stage and pulls chairs in front of tents built by people who are fighting referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with their heads up, not the doors for the ministry," says Kavadarkov.
“We are poor countries, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate exceeding 20%, so much necessary investment.
"I think that the large majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted out.
The result “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
According to the survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute, the referendum could take part in between 30 and 43 percent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
In another survey organised by the Macedonia station Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents were found to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, it must be 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious wound to the politics of the West Government since its arrival last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have been defended by Brighton on Saturday, and so Manchester City won 2-0 at the stadium of Etihad in Manchester.
At Aguera's administration, his goal seemed ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
Everything started with a note that the Argentinian attacker got in the middle of the field.
He's been proprinting between three brighton defenders and getting into an open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green jerseys.
On the edge of the penal territory of Brighton, one defender circumvented and a few others preceded.
He found Sterling next to the left.
The English attacker put a ball in the penal territory back to Aguer, who was right-wing over Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a gunshot to the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with her legs," said the City Pep Guardiola manager.
“We thought he would be playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky he was goaling at that point."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in the Premier League game but arranged for Sterling.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton territory.
On the left hand, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane worked the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote stick.
Sky Blues assailant pinned the ball into the network just before he slipped out of the field.
City will be played on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of the Rockies
When Nationals were eliminated from the playoff fight, there were no many reasons to re-entry.
But the forever-competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will stand at the place of a fighter against Colorado Rockies – but only if they have the Rockies who lead one game at the NL West over Los Angeles Dodgers, the hope of playoff.
Rockies got at least a wild card won 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“ Even if we don't play anything, we can at least start, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing, and the second team will probably play with the greatest effort I'll experience this year.
Why wouldn't I play it?"
Nationals have not yet reported who will start on Sunday, but it is allegedly advocating that Scherzer should be thrown over in such a situation.
It would be a 34th start for Scherzer, training and throwing on a Sunday when he usually leaves.
In this season, the Washington right-hand fighter has 18-7 statistics with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump went to meetings in West Virginia
Indirectly, the President commented on the situation around his candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when talking about how important it is for the Republicans to take part in the elections during the mid term of office.
“In November, everything we've done will be at stake.
One of the most important choices of our lives remains for five weeks.
It's one of the big, big ones – I'm not running, but we're still in motion and I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see the terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they're determined to take over power with any means needed, you see the wickedness, the resilience.
They don't care who's going to hurt, who's got to roll over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power, and control, we don't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to “protection and obstruction.”
“And you see it in the last four days,” he added and said that the Democratics are “an angry and evil, and disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Court, democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud bump of the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – that was a really bad word of the body – the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a variety of opinion streams.
It's untolerant to those who express their views
When the activists from Momenta on my local side voted for my reminder, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of the ranks of labourist Members to whom they said they are not welcome – because they frankly said their opinion.
With my colleagues from Joan Ryan, they treated like that because she resolutely opposed to anti-semitism.
In my case, they criticized me that I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, about Europe, paradoxically similar matters, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notification of the Friday meeting of the Working Party in Nottingham East, it was written that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of those eight years since I was a local member of Parliament for a work party, the GC meeting on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, most of the meetings do not run, and the promise of “lover, more kinder” politics was long ago forgotten if it ever began with him.
It becomes increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the labourist side and every opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It began shortly after the leader became Jeremy. Colleagues, whom I thought of earlier, that we had similar political opinions, suddenly expecting me to turn around 180°, and I would become positions with which I could otherwise agree – whether it was national security or a single EU market.
Whenever I speak in the public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then the tire of social networks, where they call for my appeal, condemn politics in the middle and tell me that I should not be on the labourist side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because my comments are usually political.
I have respect for professionalism and determination of those, colleagues who face a slope of sexist or racist insults every day, but they will never retreat.
One of the aspects of this policy era, which I am most disappointed, is how insults become standard.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diversity of the opinion current and with every proposal to express disbelief or change the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been advised many times to stay back, so much to say, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labourist Party 32 years ago as a student, he has provoked the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who has let my class fall literally apart, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need them most – whether the local councilman or the Minister of Government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with current leadership.
I would only say to those who supported the proposal on Friday that when the country goes through to Brexit, which damages homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labourist Party.
However, my main message is not addressed to the moment in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of you all.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unfamiliar Ayr is rising to the top
Two late fives have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful fun game of Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're headed for a table, like only injured.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances, which helped the domestics to win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been through great trials in our fights, and we're still unraveled, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All honors of Ayra have taken a chance better than we have.”
The five of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative of Rory Hughes, who released the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numbering advantages, and Jason Baggot got the unchanged five.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayra's penalta and then he scored in the middle of time and changed solo attempts, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and the five Patrick Anderson, converted Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on footwear, and when it started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
The Deputy Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose used the player again thanks to the unchanged five Bruce Colvin after a short pressure.
But the homemates came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for assaulting Clim without the ball, MacPherson from the penalt ranking put the ball behind the progressive Maula Ayra.
Climo turned again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught a kick of David Armstrong and sent the wing Gregor Henry for the fifth home five.

The actor refused to comment on the report, but the source of the Scottish Sun journal suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in the “prospering business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
"More is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen are guarding the sea headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
There's a blue flag over the public buildings in the ocean color.
The sea base from the lake Titicaca for the Amazon is described by the password: “More is our right.
Getting him is our duty."
There is still a living memory of the coast, which the country has lost for Chile in the bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as is the desire to rebuild the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the largest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of planning.
"Bolivia has energy, spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result," says the Bolvian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will monitor the MSD decisions on large screenings across the country with the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that – after many decades of interrupted conversations – Chile is obliged to discuss that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
The Charismatic National President of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle for re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This UN body with its registered office in the Netherlands has no power to acknowledge someone's Chilean territory and stated that it would not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes just six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case was ‘not complicated’, as says Paz Zárate, Chilean experts on international law.
And for the last four years, they didn't just support the thing of Bolivia, but maybe they'd slow her down.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the current Bolavia government," says Zárate.
He adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will start acting again once, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries haven't changed Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Deputy Bolivia in Hague, refused the idea that court decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a special opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance “to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a politician.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says it's not going to happen if the US can't believe.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arm his nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to make the promises given to the sum of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo is about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which was stuck at a dead point, for more than three months for the Singapur meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says that it is “flying hope,” that the persisting sanctions and oppositions of the US against the declaration ending Korean war could sometimes hit the North on their knees.
Washington is careful about the consent of the declaration if Pchjongjang does not make significant steps to disarm.
Kim and the president of the USA Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a general scepticism that Pchjongjang really thinks that this arsenal, probably sees the country as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris show shows that your fashion stores will soon arrive the latest trend of huge head covers
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The Valentino and Thom Browne suggestors discovered a number of crazy huge head covers for their spring/ summer 2019 collections at the show that took all fashion during the Paris Week.
Instagram flooded very impractic hats this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creation to the pier.
The exhibition piece of Valentine was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge reminiscent of feathers that flooded the head of a model.
Other excessively large accessories were decorated melons, witch hat and even pineapples – but not intended for warming their heads.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sealed lips and remind Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One piece reminded diving equipment with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a coat with ice cream.
And if you continue with huge fashion – you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could also arrive in fashion stores.
Overgrown hats come after the "La Bomba", a strawberry with a half meter wide crempoo, which everyone wore from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultmark behind this very non-ractic hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creativity to the parade moles – a smashed beach bag, which is almost as big as the model in the swimsuits that carry it.
The dark orange rafi bag leafed with rafi shafts and equipped with white leather handles was in Paris week by exhibition pieces of the collection La Riviera spring/ summer 2019 from Jacquemuse.
The stylist Luke Armitage said for FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer – given that the designer had such a great success with them, it would only be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are a need for global citizens
Individual and group achievements in sports, artistic, musical and other community activities are only underpinned.
These schools have over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and trying to provide their students and parents with the best possible level of services.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As a education sector that can propose and implement individually adapted educational plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and demanded in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with a language that he understands, it goes right into his head.
If you speak to him in your own language, it goes right into his heart."
It is a significant point of view that if we want to build relationships and trusts with people from other countries, we cannot only rely on English.
The final results of this year's tests show that the languages are at the first place of the table, with the outer level of success of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign language reached the best grade A.
The data collected from 74 Member States' SCIS schools show that the highest rate of A reached 72 percent of mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects that pupils choose are equally respected in the study plans of independent schools and other schools as STEM objects (sciences, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons which employers have identified as problems in occupancy, there are 17 percent of inadequate language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since more jobs are still required by languages, these skills are vital in the globalised world.
Whether you choose any career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future that you have such lifetime skills.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks more languages will automatically gain the advantage before competition.
According to the survey organised by YouGov in 2013 between 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent of them failed to speak in a foreign language well so that they could conduct a conversation, while the only language that spoke a two-cypher percentage of people, namely 15%, was French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language teaching.
If children know more languages, especially the emerging languages, they will have a greater chance to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs from what language it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important to the Great Britain in the view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child cares about, he will always have a choice in independent schools from several languages with teachers who are experts in that field.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to the provision of a educational environment that will be prepared and recovered from the skills needed to succeed, whatever is expected in the future.
At this point, it is impossible to deny that the languages in the global business environment are vital to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “national communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this selection, diversity and excellentness to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will first introduce himself to the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans, who are looking forward to LeBron James coming to Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, will be very soon.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would be playing a Sunday opening game in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll take.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James probably will only play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asking about his plans for six Lakers games in the presidency.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need presesonal struggles," he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, channel YouTube
President Donald Trump tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia will start a wave of performance in the campaign.
It's the first of five hostages planned for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a relaxed position in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to get support for the upcoming elections in the mid term, because the Republicans stand in the November elections before the risk of the loss of Congress.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump's Wheeling Assembly in West Virginia is scheduled for the 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's havingink in Western Virginia you can watch online below via live transmission on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearing of the candidate in the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense about the charges of inappropriate sexual behavior, and the Senate's confirmation vote is expected to be postponed for a week before the FBI investigation.
But the main objective of this wave of havingins is to help the Republicans get the pace before the November elections.
According to the Reuters, the campaign organizers say that the five meetings next week are intended to "save energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Senate Control is so important for his agenda that the president will go to as many countries in this busy campaign season," said Agent Reuters spokesman Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, today, wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could have come supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania" and could follow the media from Pittsburgh.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month Trump will visit West Virginia in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey who is staying behind in the surveys.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come to help him in the surveys," says Reuters, a politologist from the Westovirgin University, Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Team has shown that the stomach has to fight to keep hope from Sunday singles
After three unilateral games, Saturday couples can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
A swinging pendant is a completely invented sports concept, but players really trust him, and most of the same contests.
So where's the pendant going now?
"They took six points, and now it's four, so we're taking it so it's probably going a little bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, leads four points, and still 12 of them remain.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in sails, and there are a lot of things that can encourage them, such as the form Spiethe and Justin Thomas who played together all day and everyone can boast three points of four.
Spieth was deadly on the shift from the launch site to the green and goes an example.
The glorious shouts still strengthened his bicycles when he managed a key heel to get the whole game when they were with Tomas after two holes behind.
His putt, who won their match at 15 holes, met with a similar scream that tells you the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players left.
18 holes for leaving tracks.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indispensable main story of Ryder cup.
Strange, but adorable pair of Europe are four out of four and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but she passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning."
The flow and the way energy flows both towards the stormy audience and from him confirms that these are determinants to a Sunday victory, and that up to the sunset over Le Golf Naitional will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best both at the same time for a different hole.
However, the talks of European glory remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly cooperated with Sergi Garcío, the hero of the morning game with four balls when he was coupled with Alex Noren.
The pit and the two yards on the front nine were buried by Spain and Sweden in the propaganda, from which they no longer came out.
On Sundays, however, no one will help you.
Games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow the interactions of people in couples, the advice they give, the advice that they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at a moment.
Europe has played better so far as a team and has taken a significant lead by the last day, but this game of two pairs has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach for the fight that some, especially from the States, doubted.
The final day of Ryder Cupu leads Europe with a skin of 10-6 points
Europe will get a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cupu, then from Saturday double games to two balls went out with 10-6 above the United States.
Inspired by a duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly almost twice won over the fighter Tiger Woods, decided to make four radiations in Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games of two balls with an American side that failed in series 3-1.
The U.S. has shown more resistance in four, won two matches, but they couldn't get into deficits.
Page Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday 12 matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie who wins four points behind, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after the weekend, are only the second couple who won four points of his four introductory matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game for two balls and then smoothly defeated the tired Woods and the American novice Brison Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of Brillance, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game pairs to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, retreated after the morning game on two balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in a pair game at 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - one and three in the world ladder.
However, Europe did not have a pleasant fresh day from the southwest of Paris won all over the line.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They gained a rough 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game for two balls and returned later to defeat the Poulter couple and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of couples, although two first holes lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cupu, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-hr, although as a defendant Furykova party needs only a draw to obtain trophy.
After the second day he was the best in two days, he seems to be a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says, “no way,” they will not be armed unilaterally and without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continuing sanctions of the United Nations have deepened their disbelief in the United States and, under such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong told him at his annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted in the last year the “great measure of goodwill” such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling nuclear trials and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see a corresponding response from the US, however,” said.
"Without trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm one-sidedly."
While Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints on Washington’s opposition to the “regressive” approach to denuklearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every progressive step, his statement appeared as significant in not rejecting unilateral denuclearisation only because Pchjongjang had gone through the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Čong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the American President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working on the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally terminate the war conflict from 1950 to 53, but the United States said that Pchjongjang must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed the challenges for the release of hard international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “the first denuclearisation” and increases the pressure on sanctions to force their goals, and even object to “the end of the war””, said Ri.
“I feel that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our disbelief."
Ri did not mention the plans of the Second Summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader emphasized in the United Nations earlier a week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings of Kim and the South Korean Moon Jae-in leader in the last five months and added: “If a party of this denuklearisation question was South Korea and not the US, the denuklearisation of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a pathetic situation.”
However, Riho’s tone was dramatically different from last year when he said the UN’s General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles in the US is inevitable after “the evil president” Trump referred Kim to as a "raket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations Trump, who threatened “total destruction” of North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that many work must still be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is completely denuclearised.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame for it, he said: “If it lasts two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.”
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should turn Pchjongjang for the measures taken.
However, the US Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and without stopping until we realize the complete, final, verified denuclearisation"
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in attempting to suppress the financing of nuclear programmes and programmes of Pjongjang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo and Ri met at the United Nations General Assembly, and Pompeo said that next month they would visit Pchjongjang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey has not ended well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress was made only to the North Korea declare it “gangster requirements” within a few hours.
North Korea has undertaken this month to meet the Moon to dismantl a rocket area and also a nuclear complex if the United States adopts "requiring measures".
He said that Kim announced to him that “required measures”, in which he hopes, are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and aims to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard take part in a course to teach them sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University, this year, he made all his students sleep more, trying to fight the growing culture macho studios all night, when students don't sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics found that students at the world's most famous university are often helpless when it comes to self - care bases.
Course suggested Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who believes he is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he was lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?’
She said that no one has ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," said for The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains basic information to students about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's medical services, said that the university decided to set a course after finding that students were really really unsleep during the week.
The clock course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of students' tracks where students click on coffee cups, curtains, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how the athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
Participants are informed in other parts of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as well as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “study all night” still exists, added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep is growing.
The lack of sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said - even to avoid receiving, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a hunger regime, so it is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old California student of chemical and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design a course that graduated one of his classes last year during the first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended students to consider setting the alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as when he wakes up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can decide your circular rhythm, which leads to the problems of sitting.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gól potoped Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy trefa made Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Page Ibrox tried to record her first victory from 4 to 1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers group seemed to be inspired and determined to settle.
While the Rangers are now dropping to the sixth place, Livingston is climbing to the third and right behind the Hibernian team apart from one goal.
And there could be another problem with the Rangers after the bar judge Calum Spence had to be treated with head injury after he apparently hit the object from the perspective.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that crossed Ayr into the semifinal Betfred Cupu.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who took the Hearts point last week and would be happy how his well-trained manhood choked his opponent on every step.
Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's gate, but the backbone buried his big chance.
A long free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have had a quarter-hour penalt, when Steven Lawless and I got hit, but judge Steven Thomson dropped the Columbia challenge from the table.
The Rangers only managed two shots at the target in the first half, but the former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibala and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening could have been against the running of the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the work.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to the easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the recess and swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost immediate result when the wing hit Morelos, but imposing Kelly fought from the line and the attack blocked.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game exactly the kind that they like when Lithgow and Halket metals one long ball behind the other.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final phases, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
The replacement of the Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to be punished when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back again.
Almanach: Explainer Geiger's counter
And now the page from our almanache "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years, and it still comes... the day in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention which eventually led to a device known as Geiger's counter.
The Geiger Counter Stallion also became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: “Yes, now he's really in it!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system “see” dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
Then they can “see” protein that is common to many cancers, and then reinject
Test vaccine has promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells, disappeared ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can “see” protein common in many HER2 cancers and then be re-used into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “manipulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs and colorectal carcinoma, explained prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immune cells were taken from patients and “such” is to focus on cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of leukemia type.
Kanye West attended pro-trump preaching, in his maga hat, after his performance at the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whispered at Saturday Night Live after a confused performance during which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After the third song was sung that night with the name Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he started spitting on the Democrats and repeating his support for President Trump.
“ I speak to white people, ” they say, “How can you like Trump, for he is racist? ”
If I had trouble with racism, I wouldn't have been in America anymore," I said.
SNL started a show of parodium with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star was making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court of Requirement of Christine Blasey Ford rape.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's theatre talk was recorded on social media by Chris Rock's comedy.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to laugh West.
West also complained to the viewers that he had a nicely eaten his head ornament in the backstage.
“ In behind the scenes, I was bullied.
They said, "Don't go with the hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued to say, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and he added that he would have put on his superman suit because that means you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only earned the banging of the audience twice and the members of the SNL looked distressed, in embarrassment, says Varieta, and one person even said: “The whole studio completely sat down.”
West was invited to a late replacement for Arian Grande's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many presents by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: DAY, SES DAVIL DAVU.”
But the visiting talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West was “just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing.”
“But I will turn the NECHCI into a world of ideology that is harmful to my community by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “umbrellas”.
He's single.
Just like us," she added.
He told the rapper on Twitter that he changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and goes in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, previously named Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

Game Thrones Star Kit Harington got into toxic maskulinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in hand in a violent medieval fantasy series of HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, however, came out of a stereotype macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to earn respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that “something is wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic maskulinity in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his star of Rose Leslie's throne, also 31, admitted that he expressed a strong expression to this issue.
“ At this moment I personally feel quite strongly - what happened so bad with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach a teenage man about the problem we see here?”
Kit believes that TV can partly be responsible for the rise of toxic malehood thanks to its very male figures.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do you guys learn on TV, on the streets, make them feel like every man needs his side?
I think it's really one of the big questions we have in our time - how to change it?
Because I'm sure something's changed to worse.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Games about thrones after the show was completed, because he had enough 'bojes and horses'.
As of November, Kit will play in the restored west of Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robbers.
The actor recently revealed that meeting with his current wife Rose for the best that came from the Throne Games.
“I met my wife in the filming series, so he gave me my future family and my whole subsequent life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Kit's character Jon Snow's love, in this fantasy series awarded by Emmy's prize.
A couple of married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China shows a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country according to official numbers.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred by sex, which meant a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected HIV in this way was almost reduced to zero, the Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people annually.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT people is allegedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transfers come from insufficient sexual protection during these Januarys.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of the effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would have escaped the data of the Senators of the GOP, provoking the term "unsafe lies" and "conspiration theory"
On Saturday, America's Ms. Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of its employees sent personal data to three Republican American senators on the victorian legislators.
The L.A. Democrat claimed that the accusations were supported by "ultra-regional" scientists and websites.
"The lies, lies, and other repentant lies," said Waters in her Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for American senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on the internet and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's meeting on sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometimes after three Senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of contributions, is connected with Waters' office and published information on Waters personnel, says Hill.
“This unfounded claim is completely untruthful and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“Membership of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false charges - in no case was responsible for the escape of this information.
This unfounded statement is absolutely untruthful and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned an online criticism, including the one from the former White House Prime Minister Ari Fleischer.
"This affirmation is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that there is no temperament to be a member of Congress."
If someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He must not be rebellious.
He must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and not excite."
It seemed that Fleischer compared Waters' response with the criticism of the Democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too angry during the quarterly hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the elections against Waters, also expressed his ideas on Twitter.
"If it was true, it would be something," tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that her office pointed out “the competent authorities and bodies active in criminal proceedings on these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the offenders are exposed,” continued, “and will be legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous for everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English again interfers with reviews – the weaker spy parodie Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to search for Brexit in every new film with British tendencies, which also appears to be the case of this renewed Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this rude satira be about how bad the nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face was to repack this thing in a completely new way - that name more than any other signal that is a wide comic production intended for non-anglics talking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre demands for smoothie glamour, has a little of the Inspector Clouuseau, a jewel from Mr. Bean and a great piece of the guy who has given the only tone in the Chariots of Fire in London 2012.
The figure is also originally based on the traveller and international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in already forgotten TV advertising Barclaycard, and left chaos behind.
In this final edition IS there is one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the medieval armor and the rotor's cap shortly cinema about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but the humor feels quite subtle and strangely excess, especially when the “seriose” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are now offering comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like he's intended for children than adults, and for me the crazy trampters of Johnny English are so inventive and concentrated, like Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
The cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spys and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field, to scare an agent in the service - too little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and intrigued figure that has already suffered under a complete collapse of political inpopulation: Emma Thompson this thirst Theresa May plays the best character, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy is at risk, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director in some luxury facility, but at the same time passes record lessons about how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency squad and met with his long-feeling partner Bough, who played Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an infected figure on which Vicki Pepperdine may be a little wasted with.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in packing tasks for her Majesty's secret services and meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to solve British computer crimes: the evil Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyseau full of fragrant patches: masked as waiters will burn the French restaurant; create chaos when they smuggle Voltovy's luxurious yachts on board; and English will start a pure anarchy when they try to get to know the interior of Volt's house with virtual reality.
I'm sure all the aces are ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and thrilling, she has something in her child TV.
It's a pretty delicate matter.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Ronovi Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourists deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan where the British will work four days a week and get paid in five.
The Party allegedly wants the bosses to hand over savings to workers, resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they'd still take the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would "fit" in the party's economic agenda and plan to accelerate the country in favour of workers.
The transition to the four-day working week was approved by the Congress of unions as a way that workers can benefit from changing economies.
A long-term member of the workers said for Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be notified by the end of the year.
It is not going to happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a wish that falls into the positions of the party to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support this idea, the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by a working party as a total.
The spokesperson of the Working Party said: “The Fourth Week of Work is not our party's policy, and the party is not taking it into account.”
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell declared he was determined to return the energy from the “anonymous directors” and the “scientists” in the use companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the water companies do not have to return to their overall share, as the labourist government could make “reductions” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed the plans to place workers in the management boards of companies and to create funds for own ownership, which will transfer 10 % of their own capital to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in the '60 minutes' show whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, and calls upon the question of whether the findings of the Office might swing some Republican senators to pull their support.
In a conversation from Sunday '60 minutes', the correspondent, Scott Pelley, asked the Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the accusations came out, and he said, "Have you done it?"
He was decisive, determined, unambiguous."
However , Graham's decision is intact .
"On Brett Kavanaugh, I have made my decision, and it would mean a truly explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett said it hard," he added Graham with a link to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the ones she named could have been able to verify.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see anything would change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and what did he do to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place every year in New York, offering a very impressive number of stars and an impressive mission at the end of world poverty.
Global Citizen Festival welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goals of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, presented in 2012, is an extension of the Global Revenue project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To be able to obtain a free ticket for the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, telephone or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goals to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert really in a way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clicktivism" - people who feel that by signing the petition online or leaving tweet will change something?
Global Citizen says that, since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million “reactions” by its favourers, he seeks to achieve different goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to the fact that world leaders will notify commitments and measures of more than 37 billion dollars that will affect lifes of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secured funds still have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
The key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the UK partnership of investors and the realisers who have undertaken to "help children grow to their full potential" to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the subsidiary in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens such as you, we can only make a comment in the form of unjustness in history," the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 events which called for U.K. to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which would address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on our website with a question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as well as the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we will succeed before us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jacksonová, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belongs to one of the working on this year's year in New York, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to "block" to defend Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may "in case of need" depart to the Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from invading the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s engagement in Syria - especially where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern abdomen of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States have the opportunity to make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not marketed,” said.
Zinke referred to the participants in the action organised by the consumer energy alliance, which is a non-profit group that is considered in the USA as the “hlas of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they were practically the same.
“Economic possibilities for Iran and Russia are more or less investment in or replace fuels,” said, while referring to Russia as a “single” player with a economy depending on fossil fuels.
Declaration comes because Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen exports of its stained natural gas to Europe and replaced the Russian, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump's administration, including the U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to depart from the "unsuitable" project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made of Berlin's "rumitor" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that Nord Stream 2 gasvodium worth $11 billion to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's zealous resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US took a position from Germany, who reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of the German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimire Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises that “a close look” at the Presidential Candidate in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the mid-term, the "blind look" will be looking at the president's candidate.
During the meeting of the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about the candidacy.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top female position," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll be looking close to the President's Candidate."
Warren mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that “he leads this country in the wrong direction.”
"I'm afraid to the bones of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened in her critique of Trump and his appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday Warren on Twitter said: “We need a FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, anketa published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think she should be running in 2020.
Fifty percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the opinion Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidature.
The survey has shown greater support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidature and 48 percent against it.
Other highly built democratic names, which were discussed in relation to the potential candidate by 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Tracka Fuel to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq following the listing in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son is going through after his return can be involved in other families who have the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injury that our soldiers are returning with,” said the audience at the meeting with Donald Trump in Tulse, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest with “the sun in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that “they return a little different, come back, come back, come back, and ask if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen give their country, and every other member of the army.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of a domestic violent attack on a woman, interfering with a report on domestic violence and holding weapons in drunkenness, said Dan Bennett, the spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. supports the challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen States and District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new measure of the American government, which empowers asylum to victims from gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 countries and the period of Friday in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, said the NBC.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case, which, in August, has not been revealed by the Organization of Civil Liberties of Americans against federal politics.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang” abused her, but American officials refused her on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the state supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing all-time problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has revoked the decision of the Board of Appeal for Immigrants from 2014, which has allowed illegal immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. in the fifth statement stated that the new measure “ignores decades of state, federal and international law”.
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers argued in a brief way that a politician denying the entry of immigrants harms the US economy and says it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “additional jobs”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the field of immigration not to grant asylum to victims who run from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azyl is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or for political reasons," said the Sessions in his statement of 11 June.
Asyl was never intended to mitigate all problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate Rescue Trials in Palo, where the number of victims has risen twice, races in search of survivors with time
The situation was getting worse and worse for the survivors.
“It’s very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her hot boy in the evacuation center in Palo’s dusty town.
“Every minute, the ambulance will bring more bodies.
Pure water is rare."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, picking up things underground and trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were paralyzed.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulders, rested at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of continued strong concussions.
The tears filled his eyes when he showed the feeling that violent earthquake shattered the hotel's room on the fifth floor, who shared peace with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save himself.
I think I was dragged into the ruin of the wall," Haris said for the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
The US Ambassador accuses China of propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese journal published a four-story advertisement in the American Journal, which devoted mutual advantages to trade between the US and China, the American Ambassador in China accused Peking of using American press to disseminate propaganda.
The American President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the paid surcharge of China Daily in the register of Des Moines - the state of the largest sales newspaper in Iow - after he accused China of trying to mix into the US Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Peking tried to interfere with the American elections, indicates what American leaders said that Reuters was a new phase of escalating campaign by Washington to raise pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to provide commercial advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a escalating commercial war that is shown at the level of mutual imports.
The Chinese retaliation sanctions at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American Ambassador in China and former long-term Governor Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the opinion in the Des Moines Register Sunday that China now doubles this bully by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the valuable tradition of free expression and free press by placing the advertisement paid to Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, in the newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited disagreeable voices and you will not see any real reflection of the unfair views that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic path of China, given that the media belong to the company “China Communist Party”, wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish“ his article, although he did not say which newspapers.
The Republicans leave their votes before the elections for the debacle with Kavanaugh, warn analysts
As many top republicans defend the candidate for the Chief Judge Brett Kavanauga, who faces several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that during the upcoming elections in the mid-term they would know a response, especially from women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse.
Reeher said that he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will endeavor to investigating the FBI will be sufficient to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - not forgetting it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the head adviser and spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, the newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning the protesters scanned “The November approaches” at a demonstration in the hallway of the Senate, where the Republicans who are responsible for the judicial commission, decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"Democratic excitement and motivation will break records," said Stu Rothenberg, a impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already tall, that's true."
But it could be higher, especially between the weighting women's voters on the suburbs and younger voters, for 18 to 29 years who do not like the president but often do not go to elections."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, specifying her sexual assault charges on the candidate of the highest court, the analyst suggested that if the Republicans had confirmed it, the opposition could be followed.
"He was afraid of this confusing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh is used on the table, it is also about how the Republicans managed and treated it," said Guy Cecil, the head of the US priorities, the group that helps vote Democrats, pointed out on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided into the opinion of whom to believe in the light of the Ford and the Kavanaugh testimony, with somewhat more sympathies for the other appointed.
The new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claimed that they were or likely trusting Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent claimed that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake's FBI, he's currently investigating the charges raised by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified in front of the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the party during his studio at Yale University in the '80s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet and run Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, starts the startup trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open source platform of Berners-Lee, called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who people have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the Inrupt project was the "worldly domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology that enables people to create their own “personal online data storage” or under.
It may include lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Disc, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all simultaneously.
What is exceptional in the personal online storage site is that it is entirely on the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
This is called “personal authority through data.”
The purpose of the Inrupt project is to bring sources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some of the employees working on the project, cooperated with the project and community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down the night.
"We are not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his contribution to the media published on Saturday that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the website," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A spiritual celebration who received Victoriin Cross during World War I
There have been celebrations for hundreds of years since the only spiritual English church has won a cross of Victoria as a fighter during the first World War.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, the sniper killed him, and he never found out that he received the highest British military appreciation.
His two grandchildren revealed him on Saturday at the Rushden festive parade, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “genial symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s winning act.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his batalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very thick fog and strong shooting from field guns and guns."
Later, he got into the first line and with the “highest courage” led the line forward before he dumped himself into the firefield and knocked three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that was humiliating.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the show that Brentwood Imperial Youth Band was led by, a prisoner.
Michael Vann said that “he felt a great honor that he could participate in the show,” he added that “the cramp of the true hero is manifested by the support of many people.”
Fans of MMA stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got the pig Peppa
Imagine that, you've been waiting all night to watch the Bellator 206, just to be denied your main event.
The reading from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main chart and live broadcasts, took place in Great Britain all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a mutual match, the audience in Great Britain remained in amazement when the news was turned into a Peppa pig show.
Some remained unintrigued after they were awake in the early morning for the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in the show for children as “a certain form of a bad joke.”
"As according to the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6:00 a.m., and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, the higher Vice President for Marketing and Communication of Bellator after he was asked for this transfer.
"Peppa," yes.
The President of Bellator Scott Coker said that they will work on the programme so that the audience in the UK will be involved in the future.
"I think that if I think about the broadcast, we can probably make it," said Cooker.
“But there is six o'clock Sunday morning, and we can't do it by Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were lots of texts back and forth, and not all of them were very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to five matches instead of six – as we usually do – and we have tried to keep all the promises given to our fans and we failed.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “male” for sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, says that he grew up with a sense of less value to all because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to follow success.
A 24-year-old athlete said that he did not realize that “not all are like him.”
On the first discussion, Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, said he spoke loudly about the rights of gay people to give others "nature."
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympiad because of the possibility of becoming a parent.
The regular director of Kirsty Young's long-term show had a few months off because of the disease.
Daley, who appeared in Lavern’s first program, said that he felt “lesser” than anyone who grew up with him at the same time because “not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls.”
He said: “At so far, these feelings of less value and the differentiation of the real things that gave me strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said not to disappoint anyone who, if possible, would find out how it was with his sexuality.
A double holder of the bronze olympic medal became a fighter for the rights of the LGBT movement with a high profile and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he had heard because he had a feeling that he could live openly without consequences, and he wanted to give others a “nature.”
This triple world champion said that he was in love with a man – the American film director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “sealed unprepared.”
Daley had Oskar's holder, which is 20 years older, took last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was in his first Olympiad when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later on cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar rises and falls.
In June, she adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley said that he was “the whole angle of view changed.”
“If you asked me last year, it would be all in the way “I want to get a gold medal,” he said.
“ You know, there are more things than golden Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son got his name after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't want to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets for London Olympiad in 2012, because he wanted to be in front of them.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be first, Dad," he said.
“I kept him behind my hand when he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
Daley took part in the Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze.
“I knew I dreamed about it my whole life – jumping in front of our homes at the Olympic Games, I did not know a better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first composition – the Proud of Heather Small – which resonated with him when the Olympiad began and still triggered the goose skin in it.
The Desert Island Discs is sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape on Saturday at Ryder Cup, ended up on the bench
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47, Ryder Cup game, but he would have to draw a form to prevent it from being a miserable milestone.
Mickelson, who played events held every two years on a double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday four balls and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as often he used to be in the US, he spent a five-fold major winner his day alternately between cheerleaders and playing in a row that he hoped to repair what he had suffered.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National field, where a long member terrain routinely punishs the devastated missiles.
And if the golf course is not very disturbing about itself, Mickelson faces the ninth Sunday match of the exact champion British Open Francescu Molinari, who won all four of his matches this week in the team with the newbie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped quickly, Mickelson's macho could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and said nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, crying on my back, gave me his hand around his shoulder and said he was ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
“ He believes so much.
He's a member of the Hall of Salms, and in the past, this week, he was so beneficial for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine playing two men.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to attend, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Fald's record in most of the wests of Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of the career in Ryder Cup, which has never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson reached 18 wins, 20 proms and seven draws, even though Furyk says his presence of the team has brought some intangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes people to make fun and he's a great companion in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players have enjoyed the fun when they went to see him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving much more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, from experience, knows that the large leadership of the singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily change to a uncomfortable ride.
The data was debuted at the match in 1997 in Valderramo, where the cooperative headed by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they got to the target plane completely close winner 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You must remember all the time that we had a great lead in Valderramo, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderramo, where we won, but just closely,” said Bjorn, on the picture, after watching when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday in 2018 to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So, history and every member of the team showed me it wasn't over.
Tomorrow you'll be totally bored.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's how we try to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased by his players on a complicated golf course, added: “I would never do it myself.
We'll have another animal tomorrow.
Individual performances are preparing tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's good, but if you're supposed to be on your own, your golfer's capacity is fully checked.
This is the message you have to hand over to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind you, and he's got to go and get the best out of you, too.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will care to play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points in four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great vomits when he was part of the winning team in Brooklin to end up as defeated when Europe reached the “Clamping in Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," answered the question Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to head to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to start quickly like Brooklin, like in Medinah.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
According to that, we set up a set and ensure that the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to be charming tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked to try to lead the attack and face Rory McIlroy in the top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half of order.
“I went with this group of boys in this order, because I think he covers the whole way, said Bjorn about my choice of singles.
The German new warship is again postponed
The latest German sea fregata was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available at least one year for the misunderstanding and snowy coast systems, indicate local media.
The operation of the headship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, a completely new fregate of Baden-Wuerttemberg class, according to Die Zeit's quoting spokesman's journal, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after delivery have been displeased with the fate of this ambitious project.
As a substitute for the ageing Bremen class fregats, four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which has already ordered the Navy in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-load ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to put the latest fregats for up to two years outside the home ports.
However, constant delays mean that high-sea shipyards – which were supposedly to allow Germany to send forces to the overseas – will be obsolete until the date of entry into service, notes Die Zeit's journal.
Neblaze famous fregata F125 got into the paper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the producers after the shipment.
There were few reasons for return, but the German media quoted a number of essential “software errors and defects on metal elements” defects that would make the warship unusable in putting into the fight.
Software attacks were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will operate the crew of some 120 sailors – which is half of the workers who were needed on the Bremen fregats.
It also showed that the ship has a considerably excessive weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7,000 ton ship Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as ships similar to the classes used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to the defects on metal elements, the price of the whole project – including the training of the crew is also a problem.
It is said that from the original €2,2 billion, the price of EUR 3,1 billion came out.
The problems with the latest fregats have gained importance in particular in light of recent warnings that the German sea power is dropping.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the Naval Army really “the ships are capable of deployment.”
The representative said that the problems were continuously packed because the old ships were removed from operation but no substitutes were granted.
He commented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates were able to become part of the Navy equipment.
National Trust Organization listens to the secret life of bats
New research aimed at exploring how bats use the landscape in hunting food at the Scotland Bats.
There is hope that research findings will give new light to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help to manage future activities to preserve this kind.
The studies carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by bats of starving and small and brown long and water in the Botanical Garden Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas in this bat house, which will monitor bat activity throughout the year.
Staff and volunteers of NHS will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings finds the frequency of bats calling and what individual species do.
The map of habitat will then be issued and a report that will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, adviser for the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the production of meadows, and the best procedure for maintaining forestry areas for bats and other related species.
Bats of the population in Scotland and all of the Great Britain in the past century have fallen greatly.
They are at risk as a result of the construction and territorial development that affects colonies and the natural environment.
The risk can also represent wind turbines and lighting as well as flies traps and chemical treatment of construction materials as well as cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, they are more useful in hunting their ears than their eyes.
They use an excellent echo-locating technique to track bugs and obstacles on the flight.
NTS, responsible for care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, colonies control and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even created the first and only reserved bat reservation in the Threave settlement in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of the seat David Thompson states that it is an ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Threave," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand what they need to survive."
It underlines the importance of controlling bats before commencement of maintenance works in real estate because it is possible that unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and youths, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to attach her hand to work and help.
She said: “O our bats and a lot of species that we don’t know how their populations are doing, we must learn a lot more.”
Ronaldo refuses rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to a rape charge as a “false report” and said that people want to “violent” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German journal Der Spiegel, who informed these charges.
This Portuguese and attacker for Juventus was accused of the rape of American Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, informed Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the information on the accusation, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and referred the information to as "false news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold award holder of the Golden Ball to the camera.
“ They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they call my name, but that's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," the player said smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to charge Der Spiegel's journal for unsubsidised charges, which they have referred to as "unacceptable statements of suspicion in the private area".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will require compensation for “moral damage at the level of a corresponding serious violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past.”
The alleged incident was expected to occur in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel suite and in the Las Vegas casino.
After seeing Ronaldo and Mayorg's nightclub, they allegedly returned to a room where it was allegedly raped in the Clark County Court district court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told her that he was at the '99 percent' of the "clause" and "one percent" disappointed.
In the papers, Ronaldo confirms that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extra-soud settlement, because she was afraid of revenge and feared “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman claims that she's trying to renew the procedure because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronalda, at the time of the attack of steps from the transfer to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United, bought it this summer for 100 million euros, bought the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Great Britain will regret the losses of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom will “will regret forever” if after Brexit loses its status as a world leader in car production, said the secretary for Greg Clark.
He added that it was “untrusive” that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain had left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop the production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"The deal is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car said that the impact of the border delays in the absence of a Brexit agreement may be of employment.
In the Burnaston race, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured by Toyota, nearly 150,000 cars produced last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain had suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have recorded a stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, in Great Britain, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement as regards the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW states that he will close his Mini car production plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what producers call a risk to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The production line of Toyota is operated on the basis of the supply “righteously in time”, while parts from suppliers in Great Britain and the EU are supplied for cars produced for order within 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom had left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in stock at Derbyshire, the company said, and there would be a halt of production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans to revitalise future relations with the EU are “just calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
“We need a deal. We want to have the best business that will enable, as I say, not only the current success, but also the understanding of this opportunity,” said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"Not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the stopped production will be, but in the long term, it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the union at the race, said that they are more concerned with the union: “I have experience that once these places disappear, he will never return.
The government spokesman said: “We set a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be late again, says the White House
The meeting of Donald Trump at a high level with a representative attorney, General Rod Rosenstein, could be ‘a next week’ because the fight for the highest judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein reaches up to Robert Mueller's Special Council, which examines the interventions of the Russian elections, the ties between Trump's subsidiaries and Russia and the possible judicial obstructions by the president.
Whether Trump releases the representative of the general attorney and thereby jeopardizes Mueller's independence, the Washington rumours have been going on for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times journal stated that Rosenstein was discussing the wearing cameras to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of seating the president through the 25th Appendix.
Rosenstein denied the message.
But last Monday he came to the White House surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump declared that Rosenstein would not let go of the "radiance" but then the meeting was delayed not to intervene with a hearing at the Senate Court's Committee where Kavanaugh witness statements and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a weekly investigation of Kavanaugh's accusations, making the full vote of the Senate again.
Trump's press speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox channel news.
She replied to the question of Rosenstein: “The date has not yet been set, it may be a week, perhaps it will be necessary to move for another week in view of everything else in the highest court.
But we'll see and I'll always communicate the current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not due to the advertisement of television reporters, even though she said, "I disagree with the fact that they are coming out."
She subsequently suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President has more questions and answers than any president before him,” she added without showing evidence. “We have looked at the numbers.”
The conference will continue, said Sanders, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than interviews with me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and that a press conference will take place where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with attending universities.
The independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre view of the gathered reporters.
The Ministry of Health writes EU staff in NHS Scotland to fear Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written staff from the EU who work in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter not six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scotland Government has already undertaken to deal with the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “There are negotiations between the Great Britain and the EU on a distant basis over the summer, and they are heading towards the expected decision in autumn this year.
However, the British Government also takes steps in preparation for a possible withdrawal scenario without agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I would like to reassess you how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Collectives from all over the EU and outside bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our cruel desire is that you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie proceeds an emergency surgical procedure after head injury
The eliminated defender of Tigers from the State of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie took an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in Saturday defeat 31-27 from the opponent Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main coach of the state of Tennessee Rod Reed told the reporters that there was an injury shortly before the half-time.
“He came to the sideline and he just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline and then put it on a stretcher and prepared it for further assessment.
The Tennessee State functionant told Chrisz Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone a surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no “no details of the type/range of injury” and that tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in red shirt, graduates the first season for Tennessee state after transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday he had five total actions, which means 18 actions in the season.
A higher property tax will be charged to foreign buyers when buying real estate in Great Britain
A higher property tax will be charged by the foreign buyer when he buys real estate in Great Britain, with extra money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's move, whose aim is to attract young voters
Increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
Establishment of the Treasury by £ 120 million per year – to help homeless people
The buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy real estate in Great Britain, with extra money will be used to help people without home, announce Theresa Mayová today.
This act will be called an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters with a plea to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property purchase tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, while money will further strengthen government efforts to fight sleep without a roof over the head.
The surcharge, which is an additional to the current purchasing duty, including higher levels established two years ago for other homes and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the funds of up to £ 120 million per year will be increased in the Treasury.
Estimates say that the newly built properties in London purchase 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which makes prices more difficult to buy for the first time, to get to the ladder home.
A lot of the rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become the “town of spirits” just because of the high number of buyers from abroad spending most of the time out of the country.
The new principles only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after he reduced the real estate purchase tax to help more young people to their own first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding high prices of real estate by taking care of land, but not using it, and insisted on Mrs May to withdraw quotas from the prices available homes to repair the “non-precedented homes” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a striking number of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rentals and the termination of the "unsuperfect" evictions.
He also wants to increase the powers of the committees to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “I said last year that I would like to take my efforts as a premiere for the renewal of the British dream – for every new generation to have a better life.
And that means remedying our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and make life.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for those who do not live in Britain and foreign companies to buy houses as well as the hard-working residents of the Great Britain.
For a lot of people, dreams about their own home are too far away, and sleeplessness is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that his "highest ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of renewal of the Northeast Club, which currently stands third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren led the Scottish Premiership League back in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country like a player.
I got rank B and it was," said Ross on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that brings me back.
Such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in leading the club."
Ross' leaders in Sunderland's role were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Chief of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxious about following such names in such a big club before rejecting the pre-plays from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success would be the question for me at that time if I could return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I think I'd look successful if I could get the club back."
Ross's only been doing a career in leadership for three years before he was an auxiliary boss in Dumarton and spent 15 months as he was among Hearts coaches.
Then he helped Alloa's club recover from the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning of the collapse to the winner's title of masters immediately in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he ever had in his career players in clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“They were probably real crossroads,” he recalls the time when Allo was taken.
“I really believed that leadership was more true to me than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and enjoying proper heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I'm still going through them in terms of stress and pressure, but I just have a good feeling in leadership.
I've always wanted to be the manager, and now I'm doing it, I feel like I'm feeling the most in my entire adult life."

Research found that the great time for pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer wave of veder increased the income of British pubs with difficulties but increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures show that the groups of pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July – but the revenues of the restaurant have decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultative company, which created the final report, said: “The stable sunshine and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when the visit of the pub was increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
In June, the restaurant market decreased by 1.8 percent has worsened.
The hobbys and bars luring for drinks have been doing the strongest thing as the restaurants have worsened.
Hospodys whose main purchases are from food, also suffered by the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the sale of food was three percent diminished."
Paul Newman of the analytical company of leisure activities and hospitality said: “These results are the continuation of the trend that lasts since the end of April.
The weather and influence of significant social or sporting events are the biggest factors in terms of sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual decline in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer cannot be a worse time for food and time operators to tell whether the lighter temperatures we have experienced in August will bring so much necessary relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the British sector of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an established industrial scale in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hides from his parents
Every fifth child – at the age of only 11 – has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and teachers, shows research
Research between 20,000 high school pupils showed an increase in “false instagram pages”
Reports raised the concern that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of pupils have said that they have a “main” account that parents know about
Every fifth child – at the age of only 11 – creates accounts in social networks that hide from their parents.
The survey between 20,000 high school pupils showed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” on which photographs share.
The reports point out that there is a publicity of sexual content.
Twenty percent of pupils have said that they have a beautiful “main” account that parents know about and have a private account at the same time.
One mother who ran into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found that her teenage girl would ask the others to “be raped.”
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters Association and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, while half admitting that they hold private accounts.
Chief of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that he has so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them.”

Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an ineffective director at the annual General Meeting of the Management Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated light athlete and the President of Ian Beattie described the transfer as a great opportunity for those who are leading sports like those who will be useful for its far-reaching experience at international level in the past decade.
“Eilidh has extensive respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that for the athletic in Scotland it will be of great benefit when he is a member of the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the vote of athletes and I hope that I will be really useful and that I will help to lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four gold medals at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, and now is a regular BBC expert, could not walk after the transitory ischemic attitude.
He wrote on Twitter: “I've had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's just time to show me whether I'm recovering or what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've done full recovery, he's learned to walk again, and I'm doing exercises today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Suctioner of milk causing maternal comparison to cows divide opinions online
The company involved in the production of suctioners divided the online opinion by advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milking coats.
In the context of placing on the market the “first silent dishes in the world” company with excise technologies, Envi released a music video with an oversight on which the freedom that the new sucker gives to breast-feeding mothers shows.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows on a song with a text: "Yes, I'm finishing up, but you don't see any tail" and "If you didn't notice that I don't have villages, my boobs are here."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk.”
Advertisement, which was published on the company Facebook page, but caused an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw him, and many of them pointed out that it was throwing light on the “horors” of the dairy industry.
“A very poor decision to use cows to advertising for this product.
Like us, it must be pregnant and born so that they can give milk, but children are taken away a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
Suctioner Elvie is placed discreetly on breast-feeding (Elvia/mother)
Another comment: “It is understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise the breast pump for the mothers they keep their children?"
Someone else added: “This advertising is completely out of line.”
There were those who defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that the song was considered “infectious.”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I kept breastfeeding.
I feel exactly like a cow when I suck.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's a big deal.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement focused on mothers who suck milk ( often at work or in toilets) and feels like “crows”.
It's not an ad to praise or lose the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet dishes hidden under the bra.
The campaign concept is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck their milk says they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's sucker is absolutely silent, has no wires or hoses and hides beautifully into breast-feeding brass so women give freedom of movement, the possibility of keeping a child and even while sucking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Summer Elvie is so much revolutionary product that deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and cows, we wanted to point to milk sucking and all the challenges associated with it while showing a fun and reliable incredibly unreliable sense of freedom that will ensure the new suctioner.
It's not the first time Elvie's suctioner got on the debriefing.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mothers appeared on the mole was Mart Jakubowski's designer who just used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to the state camp to the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly border transitions remained relatively unchanged, in particular because tough rhetorics and principles introduced by Trump’s administration have eradicated the placement of children with accompanying them.
Most of the visitors were traditionally formed by immigrants without evidence that were afraid of being threatened by the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members had to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the immigration and customs department, testified to congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who requested the status of a lonely adolescents.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the under arrest had no prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue their prosecution," said Mr. Albence.
According to the staff of the asylum facilities, the representatives in an effort to work faster on children's matters have introduced new rules that will require some of them to come to court within a month before detention, instead of previous standard 60 days.
A lot will appear through the call within the video conference instead personally to declare their case legal status for the immigratory judge.
Those who do not have the right to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely anxiety or depression occurs in him, which may lead to explosions of anger or attempts to escape, claims asylum facilities workers and report from the system over the past few months.
The lawyers indicate that these concerns are increased in a larger device like Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is old, more likely not noticed, just because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children into a tent camp without enough time dedicated to emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that a lot of children are already fighting.
Syria announced that the US, French and Turkish “accountries” have to be withdrawn immediately
During the speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Walid al-Moual also called after the return of Syrian refugees to homes, even though eight years of war in the country has already been held.
Moual, also representing the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in the Syrian territory under the prerequisite of combating terrorism and that “this will be imposed.”
“They must surrender immediately and unconditionally,” said at the meetings.
Moual insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over and more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fire in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreigners present.”
The United States have some 2,000 units in Syria, which mainly trains Kurdian forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advises them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of the slaughtered country.
During the issue of Moual’s refugees, he declared that they were good for them to come back and accused “some Western countries” of “proliferation of irrational fears”, which caused refugees not to return.
"We have spoken to international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicians of what should be purely humanitarian matters."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be available to help recover until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations Diplomasants point out that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a protection zone in the last attack of Idlib has created an opportunity to move further in political discussions.
The Russian-ture agreement prevented the large attack of Syrian forces captured by Russia in the province where three million people live.
But Moual pointed out that the agreement had “the clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military procedure would focus on jihadists, including the fighters from the Nusra Front, with the connection to Al-Qaeda, who will “be destroyed.”
The United Nations messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee will soon take place, consisting of government members and opposition to design a post-war constitution for Syria and to rigour the way to elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee with the words that the panel’s work should be limited to the ‘to control the articles of the existing constitution’ and issued a warning before the action.
Why the Trump will win even during the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in other elections in 2020 if, as probably hoped by many liberal observers, the prosecution and scandals prematurely, his office as president would not end.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of foot-and-mouthing fatigue.
Since 2014, the main broadcasting time has been more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average rating of 2.4 million in the main broadcasting time, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago by Nielsen and "The Rachel Maddow Show" to MSNBC increased the rating of cable TV to 3.5 million watching the main night reports.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designated Survivor" show on the ABC drama about the secretary of the cabinet that became president after the attack destroyed Capitol.

He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.

Why? She asked.
“ He said, “Because he's funny with him,” said Ms. Scovell.
It's the significance of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story of the story in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether the families of immigrants can reconnect and for the benefit of the global economy.

Outside money flows into the quietest home races medium-term elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district has been taking financially through the reorganisation of congressal circles, which have generated two office holders in the fight against the same chair.
This recently led to the reconstruction of the Pittsburg suburban district by the district of the Democratic Republican Conor Lamb, who received another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania district, which is strongly overlooking with the new 17.
After the highest Pensylvania Court published in January the opinion that the old districts were inconsistently divided into the benefit of the Republicans, there was a recast of the maps.
The race in the new 17th precinct started a sharp financial breakdown between the financial branches of the main party, the Committee of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
In Pennsylvania, the name Lamb became known after a tight victory in the followed March special elections to the 18th congress district.
This chair has been taken over decades by the Republican and Donald Trump won by 20 points in the precinct.
Experts in politics give the Democrats a mild lead.
America considers to penalise Salvador as support for China, then withdraws
The Diplomas have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under a mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panamy Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in the hotel in Panama until the partners have evicted Trump's management team in court.
Ministerial Directors of Foreign Affairs decided to call off the U.S. Director of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “new decisions to continue to recognise Taiwan,” said the spokesperson of Heather Nauert in the statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But fines were considered against Salvador, which received estimated USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial assistance and focused on visa restrictions, would be for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of painful murders.
With the ongoing internal negotiations, the North American and Central American representatives of the high-level conference focused on safety and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was referred to as a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants headed to the US.
But by mid-September, the leading administrative authorities explained that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively complete any considered fines for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution to the conference currently scheduled for October halfway through the signal that the administration puts on the meeting, said diplomats.
And three American emissaries returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without having any new circumstantial news from Washington.
The White House spokesman Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debates described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the terms of anonymity.
Their resources have been confirmed by an external analyst that is close to government exekutely and also spoke on anonymity condition.
Study History
A definite nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possibility of defending Mr Trump in law enforcement, which is now in public records of many evidence.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller is allegedly turning to see if Mr. Trump's campaign had no secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If there was an exchange of sides in Congress, Mr Trump would have to apply for responsibility before this authority, just as he prepares to re-entry before the voter, and, in the end, the jury of his colleagues would probably expect it.
That's a series of "if" and I don't want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, just like those in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to organize a pup against Hitler, all they needed to build the west power and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years full of bloodshed that followed.
History is spinning around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the unnecessary movement of democracy.
The Americans now stand before several similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who runs the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's had it on his feet since the report announced that he suggested he had secretly recorded the president last year and speculated that he was not in a state of health so that he could hold the President's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times are inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing sexual assault charges and a crooking statement?
And what's the most important thing, are we going to vote in the middle of the term of office to Congress, which will judge Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe we're not failing, and that's because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, she emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn the candles on the swasty table.
How could I not be optimist about our future with such inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the Rapide Vienna meeting
The Rangers on Thursday, Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory over the Rakusans would give them a great hope after an impressive draw in Spain on the Villarreal field earlier this month, for the G Group of European League.
The knee wound prevented the backup Graham Dorrans from appearing on the field for the first time in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal. However, they believe that the Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with faith that we could take something away, and we took a point.
Maybe we could reproduct him at the end, but in general, the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, but in the other day we got better and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be hard because in the last match they played a good result, but with the viewers behind the back, I'm sure we can push and make it good.
Last year, it was hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team's strong, and the boys really enjoy it, training's good, too.
I hope we'll turn into this now, throw the last season behind our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about saving their pension.
Even though the participants had a clear idea of how they should be taken care of, few were talking about it with family members.
About half of the people in the national study declared that she had discussed the cost of long-term care with her partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of them in the family, but do not decide to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Together with your adviser and family, discuss where and how to take care, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Invite your financial adviser: Advisor can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed by traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance, which will help you pay these expenses, or by using your own insurance – until you have money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as you can.
Set up a representative for medical care, which will be a credible person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You will choose a credible person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in the event that you will not be eligible for this.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details into a written plan for you to be prepared.
“In the game, they are not just finances, but for example, what are the names of nurses?” Martin asks.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan ready for your hand."

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from Donggal Regents, which is a region north of Pala, which is closer to the epicentre of earthquake with a force of 7,5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the catastrophe exploded.

Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for suspects from a terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saip, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died, is a special punishment that has not been granted for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly in October, attacked a cycling along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan district using a rented truck Home Depot, which he ditched the walkers and cyclists.
To defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “indefinitely” killed eight victims and caused a number of injuries – thus defining the conditions of the intention of granting the death penalty in accordance with the document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to the court documents, both these figures would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal large jury accused Saip of 22 criminal offences, including, for example, murder charges for extortion, which the federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “a significant planning and preparation,” claims the prosecutors and describe the way Saipov did, as disgusting, cruel and perverted.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholase Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diega Mendozy and Alejandra Damiana Pagnucca,” is mentioned in its intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York has given the last death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually, in September 2009, was sentenced to a lifetime sentence of freedom.
Last time, the death penalty was actually executed in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a couple of spouses were executed by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, which were demonstrated a conspiracy for the purpose of spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs used to be an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan native, demonstrated minimal regrets during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's accusation, he told the authorities that he was inspired by watching the Islamic State's video on the phone.
The police also published that he also demanded the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal advocates representing Saipov, said that they are “obviously disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of accepting the guilt and detention of life without allowance will only extend the trauma from these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The team of Saipov defenders had already asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
According to Members of the Conservative Party, it should be entrusted with negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage was committed to mobilising the army of the people during today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom's independence Party declared that politicians must feel pressure from the Eurosceptics, as suggested by one of their own Members of Theresa May, should lead negotiations with the EU itself.
A regular conservative Member Peter Bone declared that the United Kingdom would be out now, if he was the secretary for Brexit Mr. Farage.
But the problem that Mrs. May faces in order to set up its ranks, where deeply disrupted, has highlighted the conservatives fighting for the persistence in the EU who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her compromise plan from Chequers under the attacks of thetáns of Brexit, the defenders of the Union and the EU alone.
The partners insist that they will continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Euroskeptics and Labourists to choose between its package and ,chaose.
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group will gather in Solihull where he wanted to drop off on Chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
,If he was headed, we would be outside today," he said.
Wellingborough added: ,I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to quit Chequers.'
To show his opposition to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight the world war to have to listen.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.’
Mr Bone has rejected the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British citizens would change their mind and want to endure is completely vicious."
Conservative Advocate of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told the reporters: ,One I say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and do not like it by members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be chosen at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In the sharp report for Mrs May, he says, "Minister's Presidents will keep their place while keeping their promises."
Mr Farage declared that conservative politicians must be in an unpleasant situation if they wish to betray their decisions taken on the basis of a 2016 referendum.
,Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
,They try to betray Brexit and we stand here today to tell them that we will not let you."
In the report of an enthusiastic crowd, he added: I want our political class, which is at the edge of Brexit’s injuries, to feel the pressure.
,Now we mobilize the army of this country's people, which has provided us with a victory in Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Britain that is held by itself.'
In the meantime, the Persistents in the Union marched Birmingham and then organized a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had transparency of the Conservative against Brexit after the weekend start of the operation of this party.
Mr Adonis, Labourist Member of the Conservatives, laughed at the security problems of the party's application after the opening of the conference.
,This is the people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for unproblem boundaries, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
,Celé's a farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to think carefully on the president's candidate.
American senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after November, she would “goodly think about the candidate for the president.”
Boston Globe reports that the Democratic of Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at the town hall in the West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting a November re-election against the Republican Deputy Geoff Diehl, co-president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself in the centre of speculation that Trump could stand up in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voter at the town hall since Trump settled to the office.
One of the participants asked her whether the president's office was planning.
Warren said that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that means a woman in the highest place.
He was arrested by a suspect of the shooting of Sims from LSU.
The police at Baton Rouge, La. on Saturday, announced that she arrested a suspect from the Friday shooting of the team LSU Wayd Sims.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video was released from the Friday shooting with a request for an identification of a man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday mornings near the campus of the Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury to the head, which did not conform to life," said the police chief Murphy J. Paul medial through the web 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his boyfriend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was moving at the crime scene, had a gun and admitted the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was injured without incidents and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 inches high Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, of which 10 were in the last season, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps for the match.
Great price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the World Master when the team regime played him in the hands of victory over Sebastian Vettel
The moment Valtteri Bottas ended up in a Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team regime would play a big role in the race.
From the field of position, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two corners he defended his position and called Vettela to attack the team partner.
The vettel went into the depa first and let Hamilton catch up cars circling to the guts of the group, which should be decisive.
But Hamilton went forward and in a tight fight, the rider of Ferrari had unwillingly left the inner track free to defend himself in the third corner after double manoeuvre.
Max Versappen went out of the back row of the bicycle and at the end of the first round was on the day of his 21th birthday in the lead.
Then he led a large part of the race because he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the fast final and could capture Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Eventually, he went to the depa at the 44nd round, but in the remaining eight wheels he couldn't increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got commanded, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad word of the body.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday meeting because she insisted that she had not published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with the accusation of the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at the meetings in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement provided by Ford in front of the Senate Court Board, instead of saying that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “wise and disgusting and lying.”
“One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that's been going on in Senar for the last days, when you see that anger when you see those people as angry and evil, and disgusting and lying,” he said.
“If you look at the release and publication, they will tell you: ,ach, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, would you like to escape for that leak?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document-- , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , y , y y y y y y y y y
Oh, no.
She didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
No, no, we didn't," he added and imitated in the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped from the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's commandments, I didn't even publish the case," said Klomisi Feinstein, as The Hill informed.
"She asked me to keep everything secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, it seems to her words that the president, who, at Saturday night, expressed himself at the meeting, did not believe: “I will tell you that it is a really bad speech of the body.
She may not have, but anyway, it's the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend a candidate for the Judge of the Supreme Court, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democratics use these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take the power back with any means available.
You see the villain, the disgrace, they don't care who he's gonna hurt, who he's got to fuck in the ground to get back to power and to the corridor," he quoted the words of the President's Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars corrected the fifth loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants wins in Saturday's retaliation in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
Soon the Giants took a two-branch lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's intervention.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for their homes before Dwyer returned Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard then again compared for Dundee, whereby two goals of Lukase Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's team, who managed to defeat 2-1 on Friday in Belfast Dundee.
Both teams met in the fourth season, with all three previous games dominated the players of Giants.
Dwyer's first gate came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendal McFaulla's assist, while David Rutherford joined himself at Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got his home back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the cabins for the first break, but only in the lead when he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The housekeepers regrouped and the Bouchards managed to recompensate the goal from the cross-country game at time 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcorana helped later in the second third of Nielsen for the first time in the match to turn the lead to the side of Dundee and the same player insured the leadership of his team in the middle of the final third.
Giants, who have lost the fourth of the last five matches, will play another match on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic manager died to allow hundreds of people on board a plane to escape earthquake
The air traffic manager in Indonesia is glorified as a hero after he died when he watched to manage the plane with hundreds of people on board safely to fly.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the big earthquake that caused tsunami in Friday at Sulawesi.
Strong concussions flooded the area and many were trapped in the wreckage of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung was running to save their life, he refused to leave his place in the wilderness with a denial control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He stayed in his position to take care of that Batik Air Flight 6321 flight, which was at that time at the ranch, can take a safe flight.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said to the TV channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We've prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed the concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The Agency responsible for disaster management said that the access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
“The number of deaths are increasing because many bodies remain unprotected under the wreck, and many of them still have not been delivered,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesperson.
The waves in the devastated Palu reached a height of up to six meters, and a mass burial in town will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are transporting assistance and supply to affected sites.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are robbed everywhere."
John Gelfand, head of the international red cross in Indonesia, told the CNN station: “The Indonesian red cross is trying to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will actually find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the military members of the country: “I ask you to work on the day and nights and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" she said the CNN station.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now claiming that one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon.
A flight company operating in a lagoon on one of the microne islands in Paacifik has now stated that one person is missing, and at the beginning it stated that all passengers and crew of a total number of 47 people evacuated safely from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini in the press release stated that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find one passenger.
The airline company stated that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in finding a lost man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements of providing details about this passenger, its age or nationality.
Local ships helped to save other passengers and crews after the aircraft entered the water when attempted to land at the airport in Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials claimed seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in custody on Saturday and all were stable.
However, what caused the crash and the exact follow of the events remains unclear.
The US airline and Navy said that the plane was given in the lagoon before the landing track.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very small height.
"That was so good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that along with the others he managed to get water through the deep belt to the emergency exits of the diving aircraft.
He also said that the board staff panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a lighter head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that seafarers who worked near the harbour mound adjustments helped to rescue using an inflatable boat transported passengers to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network reports that in the last two decades, 111 persons died in aircraft crashes with the PNG registration mark, but no accident has happened to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of the woman who was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday ended its speech in this case, in which a man is repeatedly judged of the burning of a woman alive in Mississippi State in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Ministry in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for several hours and has provided expertise in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury has reviewed the script as he used his cell phone records to the 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers of the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received localization data from several mobile phones, which demonstrated that Tellis was at the night of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, said The Clarion Ledger.
When on the basis of the mobile phone data, he was able to spend the night with Chambers, he found out he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford was standing in court in the courtroom and testified that the day in question was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford said, “he's lying because my car was in Nashville that night.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
However, the cell phone records indicate that the two of you knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that the moment after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, call and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it completely out of his life,” said Hale.
The defense will start its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he was expecting the case to get before the jury later on the same day.
High Breed: What is an conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions on this genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that the hip hop moved from its beginnings with political messages and social problems.
They therefore want to return to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists, like The Fugees and Common, have already met the resurrection in recent past thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey in Great Britain.
Another black girl?!
The NY educator sues a couple for his release after a “rasist” text message
The New York educator sue a couple for his discriminatory discharge after having received an incorrect text message from her mother, in which she was referred to as a “there's black girl” text report.
A couple refused that they were racist and compared the lawsuit l "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed terrifying when she first day at work in 2016 found that her new teacher, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEÉÉÉÉE, OTHER ČERNOŠKA," wrote Pi. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text report.
However, she sent her husband twice to drink.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman had fired Mrs Maurice and said that she had just left her teacher who was African-American, worked really badly and that she was expecting Filipino, said the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job, and Uber was sent home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for compensation for discharge from work and demands a compensation of $350 per day of a six-month engagement for which she was hired at the beginning, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that this isn't happening," said Post this Friday, and she added: "I know it's discrimination."
However, the two returned the strike with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employed was an appropriate measure, as they feared that they could no longer trust her after that offense.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco of Post.
“But would you confide your child in the hands of someone to whom you behaved gross even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Oh, come on."
Plasco liked the prosecution for "extortion" and said that his wife was only taking care of two months old and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you be chasing someone like that?
It's not a nice thing at all," said the investment banker.
Although the court continues to persist, the jury on social media has very quickly condemned the couple for their behaviour and logic.
Publishing stories about Paddington's bear feared that readers were untapped with a talking bear, show the last news
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said to the rapporteur: “It is difficult to feel in the situation of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know now that we know the great success of Paddington's bear."
She pointed out that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before letting him inspire to write a book about a small sleeve bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the book publication, which became a "sweethorn" drop after his death last year.
To Paddington, which he described as a “very important member of her family,” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was quite a silent person, he was never bragging,” she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real figure for him, it was like you had a child that achieved something that you can really be proud of.
I think Paddington's success was looking at this look.
Although it was his simple creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all successes only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louise Pasteura 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he did not expect to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“I had a call from Nada, where she told me she was gonna die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did it.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to keep her heart in progress slowly lost their effectiveness and abandoned her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to just keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now a grieving loss of her daughter, entered the plane together with other passengers without showing what a hard test she's going through.
"No one knew about it," said.
“ I kept my head down, and they kept tears on my face all the time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt a tremendous understanding to Nado.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he could love her."
Smuggling women send postcards to prevent each one on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved persons as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers on which people can search for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was only 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and, as a result, he took his life in 18 years.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up every room."
However, before he died, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found his sibling's inevitable body after he took his life.
Ms. Davis says: “I'm constantly afraid of what this will affect his life.”
Mrs Davis suggested a postcard, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they were their friends.
Don't be silent - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies' summer friend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt at the bottom, or depressed, nothing," he explains.
“ A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst was on Christmas Day – when the children opened presents, neither looked at them, nor looked at them."
She pointed out that the death of her partner was a tremendous trauma to them, but that she had to get through it gradually: “This thing can do a complete hole in the family.
It broke us up.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of the FBI's investigation.
“I thought that we could get something that he really asked for – an investigation at a limited time – we could bring a little unity into it,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, and he said that he was afraid that the committee would “shoot down” because both sides of the party would bury in the conquered positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
Elections in the mid-election period are only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if the Republicans do as expected wrong, this will lead to their major weakness in attempts to enforce the desired man at the Supreme Court of this country.
George W. Bush was on the phone with senators, haunting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and his way to meet his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI draws up his report?
The Senate will vote on it and now there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which was possible for vice president Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm in the Supreme Court.
Numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim “sick”
The number of refugees from North to South Korea since the beginning of the Kim Čong-Una government fell seven years ago, claimed by the South Korea legislator.
The Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry for Reunification, said that 1127 escapes occurred in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that there are more strict checks on the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates required by smugglers at the borders.
Pjongjang didn't give up any public statements.
The great majority of refugees from the North today receive an offer for South Korea citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans exceeded the border.
Most of them run through China, with which North Korea has the longest boundary and is easier to cross it than in a hardly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China is staring at refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between North and South – technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pchjongjang to talks that focused on stopped denuklearisation negotiations.
This was the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Čong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on the extensive conditions for cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US that there is no progress in the issue of sanctions.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in advance of the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the Democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, "hysterical" and said that because of her temperament, he is inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this note in the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help myself, but if any woman ever demonstrated such a theater, they would call it "hysterical," she said Pelosi in her reaction to Kavanaugh's quarterly statement before the Senate Court Board.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all the charges that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was sexually attacked at the time they were both at adolescent age.
During his introductory words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost screamed and choked in dealing with his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and said that their charges against him are “grotesque and coordinated attacks” by organised liberals who were unable to transfer through the loss of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was suspicious against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he was relying on Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi replied negatively to the question of whether she would attempt to appeal Kavanaugh in the case of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House.
"I will tell you this – unless he tells Congress the truth, then he is not not only qualified for work at the Supreme Court, but also in the court that he is working on now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. district court.
Pelosi added that, as a democratic, she was concerned about the potential returns of Kavanaugh in the law of acceptable care or Roe vs. Wade because she was considered a conservative judge.
In the course of the hearings preceding his confirmation in the office, Kavanaugh avoided reply to the question of whether some decisions of the Supreme Court would be revoked.
"There's no time for a hysterical, interconnected person to join the court and expect us to just say, "Oh, that's wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After vocabulary, months, and years, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who made the principal somewhere helped me, and she said she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique, meaning that when she was angry and she started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “You may think I'm crying because I'm sad.
But I'm angry."
And that's how she kept it going.
And I think that's great."
The tears are acceptable as an anger reaction, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in the office where my men dominated. I once expressed my inexplainable anger with crying. But the older, always a cold manager who I always feared a little, caught me behind my neck and dragged me to the staircase.
"Never show them that you're crying," she told me.
“ They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congressman from Colorada, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a non-human affair on a ship of Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she couldn't examine the idea of her own presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well-thinked decision," she said to me with laughter after 30 years.
“The other seven candidates have already been running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow and Seven dwarfs.
Because at that time, the campaign has been running a long time, she couldn't keep up with getting contributions, so she committed to not letting her go into the game unless she gains $2 million on contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm gonna get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made her harder to obtain money and focused on the voters rather than on delegates and from anger over sexism, that she was completely strangled by anger.
"Maybe you think I'm nervous," said Mrs. Schroeder, on how the press responded.
“And perhaps you would think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they'd probably write to me on the tombstone.
"Pleaked"?
Why can a Chinese-American Trade War for Beijing be good
The initial trade war hall between the US and China was delusional and even though the battle is far from fighting, according to experts to being a crack between countries in the long term beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the USA, gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the most important escalations have seen the light of the world this week, when new tariffs have been declared for goods of USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), which is practically the taxation of half the commercial exports from China to the US.
Peking has responded every time, the newest imposition of customs tariffs to five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China has tried to repay the US with the same coin and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world would be kneeled.
Although China would want Washington to go back to the original tracks, it would mean retreat his demands, but publicly subjecting the US demands would be completely humiliating for the Chinese President Si Ťin-pching.
However, professionals think that if Beijing could play his cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in a long term because it would reduce the mutual dependence of these two economies.
“The reality is that the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic culpment in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have yet triggered,” said Abigail Grace, research co-worker, who focuses on Asia in the thought tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, said the Foreign Minister
Syria argues that she is ready to volunteer return refugees and asks for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven-year war.
During the talk at the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moual said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in combating terrorism," said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal conditions.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life.
The UN estimates that Syria has left over 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by rebels.
Europe strongly responded to the victory in Ryder Cupu in Paris
The team of Evria won in Ryder Cupu in 2018 by defeating the U.S. team with final score 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field at the edge of the difficulty in France.
The US has now lost after sixth in European soil, which has not won the Ryder Cupu in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn and its team reached 14.5 points needed for the U.S. defeat.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then fired the ball into the water at 3 pairs of 16 holes and released the victory of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of 4 players and achieved the best result of 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most evaluated player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who probably graduated his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points gained for his career.
“ I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave the cup to his krajan John Ramp, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel the incredible pride that I defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," Rahm said, 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cupu.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who has earned 14 greatest titles, which can compare only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend trying to find fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated top golf throughout the tournament.
Captain of the United States Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of these boys, they have really fought.
This morning, we really warmed Europe up at the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm packing a hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We'll regroup and, in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cupu Committee, move forward.
I like 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really have to go.
You played us."
Updates on red flow: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Committee on Florida Fish and Wildlife points to the overall decrease in the concentration of red flow in Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC communication, stains of blooming water are now reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts – this suggests a decreasing concentration.
The flowing water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coast from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
Stains were observed about 10 miles from the coast in Hillsborough, but last week it was relatively less places.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
The average concentrations at the coast or on the free sea were reported last week at the Pinellas period. In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, the lowest to high concentrations at the coast or on the free sea in the Sarasota period, the lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte, the lowest to high concentrations at the coast or on the free sea in the Lee period and low concentrations in the Collier district.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in Northwest Florida last week.
