What's going to happen?
The new CSSD Council will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old-fashioned colleagues from ODS in the Prague Council and the representativeship.
The journal Aktually.cz members of the new advice from the ČSSD "tested" as they know the notorically established slang, which was born at the town hall during the last few years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which introduced the Prague political smetan during the previous era of primate Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and caus in the metropolitan.
Surprisingly, the new councilman did not understand much.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politician," responded to the "clotrovsky" councilman's test for the culture of Lukáš Kaucký.
And while it was a political veteran, councilman Karel Březin responded similarly.
Like the term "holf hole."
"It's the only expression you're giving me, I sometimes use."
"No other slang in general."
From the vocabulary, whose term of the journal Aktually.cz published this year in June before the ODS election, she selected six examples, mostly those who are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The socialists were supposed to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the candy shop", "being the neck", "trayal of the capital city" and "smoking".
Trinity from the council with the quiz agreed, fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is supposed to be in charge of Prague school - first promised the interview, but later he didn't take the phone.
Fifth Councilman Peter Dolínek has rejected the test.
"I'm not dealing with these things at all, and I'm not going to appreciate how civil Democrats enjoy."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand ourselves within our programs," he responded.
As it has already been said, Councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not, in the title above, allegedly, noted that the talk is about the influenced entrepreneur and friend of the exprimator Beem Roman Janouško.
"Voldemort" Kauck doesn't tell him anything, and the only term he properly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the tunnel of Blanka," says Kaucký, and he says, "but I know it more from the newspaper."
"I'm gonna have to pay for some language course," he's joking.
The golf hole then, as a tunnel Blanka, deciphers not only matador Karel Březina, but also radical for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both social Democrats know who Voldemort is, and Lukáš Plachem is familiar with where to find this character - has the meaning of the expression "to go to the candy shop".
"I mean to go to some Prague business," it's flat close to deciphering that it's the headquarters of Janouškov.
In comparison with the March, he reminds us that he's got knowledge out of the paper rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy according to the test frequencies, there is no similar slogan of slang expressions.
"I've been dating my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like this."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes they use shortcuts and collaborations," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský, whom the uncles call Huld.
"The school called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits to his own nickname Karel Březina.
The journal Aktually.cz has tested the name and works.
Radní Weinert is for the grandfather's uncles, or less friendly old man, deputy Miroslav Poche, who warned himself before the elections of the party's sponsorship, has a nickname "Igráček" with some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing social democrats admit in the interpartial talk.
Hulinsky says he doesn't like to hear Huldu, but the journal Actually.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague President.
He said that Peter Hulínský won his title JUDr. at the brotherlyslav police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of the witches, gave the brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso have several common characters as witches.
It belongs rather to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one with the witch "stans" is sent to isolation so she doesn't threaten the rest of the village.
"This fate can only rarely be done."
"Not even young healthy women are moved away because they help at work and they give birth to children," describes the regular sister who is in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, aged in a special house by over a hundred women who have expelled their associations from their ranks.
The local government now decided to take action against the unusual social action.
She gave out an information brochure that should help chase the witch.
But the thing is a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," he pointed out the disadvantages of written awareness of Die Standard.
Witch charges are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, who is neighboring with Burkina Faso, last week, Ammy Hemmah died two-seven-seven-year-old after three women and two men tortured her, polished her with petrol and burned her.
He informed the BBC server about the case.
The perpetrator says it was a unfortunate coincidence.
The woman's version of their version started the oil that is used for ritual anointing.
Said he sailed after the group wanted out of the woman to expel the evil spirit.
The insulation of the witches promotes people regardless of the level of education.
Der Standard quoted a twenty-fourty-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The eating of human souls always meant danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso chasing for a witch, the government tries to calm down, in Gambia, the president himself participated in it last year.
"Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, started a wide chase for witches, which allegedly were to participate in her death and tried to kill the president himself with black magic."
"In order to help, he invited the shamans from near Guinea, who accompanied policemen, soldiers and personal security guards of the President, who had taken randomly selected men and women from the Gambi villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International.
At the farm, people had to drink a herbal potion with halucinogenous effects, which in addition caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were released to freedom.
Bakal's tenant: Topi in stones, higher rent signed
The older underwear man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG apartments "uhlobaron" Zdeňk Bakaly, the largest private owner of the apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried a file under his arm and in it a new lease to three apartments: his, his daughter and his son, who is in charge of punishment.
All three of them just lifted their rent.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for the apartment of 2+1 second category of CZK 4100 from next year.
"And there is no warm water and must toast with petrama (the foam on solid fuel, notably red.)," shows a man with a finger in his son's new covenant, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half annoyed and half resigned.
The Citizens' Association of BytyOKD.cz, which has identified new rental conditions as "neureal and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they publish instructions on how to act against them.
But a man's only got his hands on it.
"One says it, the other thing," it clouds.
Ostrava becomes a great deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, there is a large majority of apartments that still have non-market rentals in the Czech Republic.
That's why it decided to visit the Laboratory personally.
The Havířov waiting room RPG is one of a total of four in Ostrava, and on Tuesday, 9:00 a.m. is already full.
There's a security guard right next to the door, and she's got an incinerator.
"Najej 2011", lights a special button on its touch display.
One knocking, and the machine's gonna pull out a number paper.
You can't even read "157" and your cip is already on a large display under the waiting room ceiling.
You're up in half a second.
After a while, the old married couple comes to the rent, but apparently no new hires are involved.
Most people came to solve common problems like others - applications for repairs, insurance events and similar events.
Letters with new lease contracts are received in Ostravsk in postal deposits by the tenants of a total of 44,000 flats of RPG portfolio from around half of November.
RPG The apartments in their letters propose to increase their rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new rent was opened at the client centre on November 18th.
"It's been running over a week, so it's just in the run," they're responsible for the worker behind the counter for a while to hesitate when the client is presented as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local compressive topic.
Before the elections, he was haply taken by the Vice-President of Parliament and the Ostrava Families Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD, and now the local newspapers are full of it.
"Two years after them, I want a new floor."
"Not even the pose board in the toilet," the man mentioned in the introduction relieved.
As far as the workers say, pensioners come to see if they get the rent discount if they sign in time as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
The half discount on February rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Hammer's "deregulation" counter, but the questions are definitely not absorbed.
"From yesterday, 360 clients here for rent for 2011 were only about 40 to 50 people," estimates the workforce at the counter.
However, the RPG proposes individual agreements where necessary on the web and its walls.
However, if both parties fail to agree on rent, they will have to establish an independent court.
"It is not a threat, but information about only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," notes the RPG on its website.
"No one will judge here," thinks one of the RPG apartments and a man in the street in front of the client centre gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have five grand left to eat, I don't have to judge myself," he says.
But the worker will only disagree in the same way.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
The lease regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG, their economic necessity is increased.
"The current rent does not yet reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, the director of the residence portfolio of the RPG apartments, that just an angry tenant, the negligence of the housing fund, is the main reason for increasing the rent.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it would be 5.2 billion.
A large screen hanging at the ceiling across the pilgrim seat of the Haviř waiting room repeats several redly highlighted information so far.
"The increase of rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 flats, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by CZK 7.50 per meter and a month," it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from RPG portfolio will rise by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," notes the RPG.
2600 apartments stay the same next year.
RPG The apartments promises that deregulation will not expel the rent in jump, but will be distributed within four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase of the rent (see chart) will give the company back to the apartments, especially in heat savings - new windows and warming.
First of all, they're supposed to be given to people who will sign a lease increase agreement.
The offices include a preschool, they understood architects
The administrative building of Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with color walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design may visit her.
The project-architekton company Arch.Design, of whose studios came up a number of major Brno buildings, counted with space for its corporate minischool since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and cared for women of designer and architects to get back to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of shortages, a kindergarten is a benefit offered by Arch.Design to its employees under the social programme.
So the stables and architects have the opportunity to lean on demanding jobs with childcare care.
The Minischool has developed the employees of Arch.Design, and with the support of leadership, they have managed to obtain the grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment and State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of CZK 2.8 million) they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
Arch.Design has the obligation for 3 years to operate the mini-school for its own costs after the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years).
The preparation of the project lasted one year, and with applications for grants, Economy Rating has been substantially assisted.
Care is provided by qualified staff, nurses and teachers of the Ministry of Health, so they can walk children without age limit, yet most of them over 3 years old.
Because it's a minischool, there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but there's even more to change during the day.
The operation of a kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use a preschool regardless of the position hierarchy in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme filling in the mini-school is comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation to school benches, they are also taught English.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and fall out of stress situations with late picking up children from a nursery away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents use working time more productively.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal relationship between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design thus included the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and has strengthened personal marketing through this programme.
The house of the bone fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the cereal of the right lizard, the staircase reminds the dinosaur's spine and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house, thanks to its organic shapes, he earned a nickname of the House from the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, slices of tiles and mosaics, facades reminiscent of the drawers and all-time soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The front of the house plays a dream line, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
For detailed observation, geometricity, rhythm, and precisely thought order is visible.
In the night the facade sounds even more dramatic, it is glowed so that the impression of the gloss of color is still strengthened.
Violation and twisting shapes with the same measure appear in interiors.
The wood in waves copys window frames, rails, ornamental elements of doors, coaches and belts.
The house Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district on the busy Passeig de Grácia street 43, was rebuilt of the house from 1877 from the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on destroying old construction and building a completely new, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló business house, but Antoni Gaudí did not propose himself.
Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
On his design board, there were decorations for the representation apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaic in the facade.
A number of other artists and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of the Casa Batlló house has begun a successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the building of the Gaudí house Casa Milá and the Güell Park, where there are other works of Gaudí.
From the locals, the house has earned its organic shapes the nickname "The House of the Bone".
Others started to call it a "reasoning home" because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, the patron of Catalan, is similar to the top of the construction.
Other sculpture elements of the construction include hidden religious motives.
Gaudí at home designed a unique central heating system for his own time with spherical passages and typical chimneys.
The bizarre may seem to be their 40 degrees tendencies.
When Gaudí was forming, he absolutely did not respect the construction regulations of the day and did not let them be bound.
At the beginning of the construction, though he received a construction permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so important that two years later, the city council was endangered and claimed to be corrected.
For example, the Council disagreed that the construction interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
There was never a remedy: only 15 days after the challenge of the city part Josep Batlló requested (and successfully received) permission to rent two highest floors of buildings.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the galleries on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor the bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The whole six-story house is swept through the staircase, which can be climbed up to the very roof terrace.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and direct lines and the replacement of them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the living doors and the larger society can communicate conveniently without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí's rebuilt also gained untraditional roofing and two extra floors.
It is also impressive for Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is covered by the inner court, and lights.
The game of two colors delivers maximum light on all floors of the house.
Simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which is absorbing the sunlight.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most expensive apartment available to the public.
The owners decided for this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the fifty anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They persisted at the tour as they found that it was a very beneficial business and, moreover, they extended the tours of common and suburb areas, including the roof terrace.
It is certainly not negligible to the monument, it is 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist license holders have a 20 percent discount.
The total exceeds the price of the entrance to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of the house with the dragon towers, you have to quickly make friends with some of the people of the maker and visit him directly at home.
How to choose mattress and pearls: women have requirements other than men
Not a chaste frame of bed, but the quality of the lodging area, i.e. mattresses and pearls, give the foundation of really good beds.
However, it must be complemented harmoniously in order to comply with a particular user.
The choice decides a lot of things from the weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Important is also the type of interior in which mattresses and pears are arranged.
Typical example?
For example, for the weekend cottages, where they don't regularly drown, they're not suitable latex mattresses because they're slower "heating".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than the standard polyurethane mattress.
It is therefore necessary to rotate regularly.
If they do not have a lot of air channels in the core, and still lie on a solid plate, they hold moisture: the fungi may appear under them.
It also determines the custom when choosing.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses are often used with softening layer, it will be difficult to feel well on low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey people who came back from NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"For their shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes that have a nervous system disorder, so they mislead, information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in aquatic furniture.
Many of the hockeys, but also other customers, that's why, years ago, the mattress with lazy foam was looking for.
"Today it's okay, the appropriate mattress needs Tempor, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "crazy" works simplely.
Optimalizes its thickness and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't turn around at night like after a hard fight.
You'll just get better sleep.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against proleases.
When selecting the size of the mattress to your height add the length of the feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman with a height of about 180 cm so they need beds 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm, together 180 cm.
For individual beds, such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For the comfort and possible visit.
"One is the rule for the width of the bed simple: when you lie on your back you should have your hands comfortablely tightened in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the mastermaster of the Cech of the janitors and decorators, which has been devoted to the issues of healthy sleep and ergonomy furniture for many years and has been lectured in professional schools.
For double beds, each needs their own peat and mattress, but here, be careful when buying, so you can sweeten the heights of mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing other than fitting the pearls into different heights, but you don't have to do that with each bed frame.
The foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm height, Types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters shall be counted on the forming and circular layer.
"In touch with your hand or dosing on the mattress, you must certainly not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokop.
Each mattress requires a certain type of pearl.
All-wheel beds, where mattresses and foundations are like grown Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are badly winding, they can't wash their coating, which is now common.
And since we usually pump 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat at night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to remind one large (and stuck) net.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogans on mattress life for up to 25 years or even life assurances.
But everything has its own but.
Therefore, the Sellers' Practice Board: for mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and the work of a sniper coating do not give up, but rather add a mattresses protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Even though the mattress covers are commonly produced today in the whole perimeter, we get two parts (for the washing and size of the washing machine very important!), however, the manipulation of larger types (and at one person) can remind when you see a fight of light weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead?
Never!
Toply on a bed intended for visiting for one night.
However, you will have the board (if it no longer has) by winding holes and use the spring skeleton mattration and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (with them).Taschenfederkern) and a boiling layer.
Polyurethane mattress doesn't belong on that basis.
14 to 18 lamels will be suitable for latex or sandwich mattresses (meaning of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid for roasts with a larger number of lamels, 28 and more where lameles in the beder area are doubled and they can be regulated.
The positioning lamel pearls do not belong to the mattress with the spring skeleton, because they do not react to the positioning.
Aside from the setting of the lamel ribbon, the so-called shoulder cradle may also be allowed.
It's a special lamel sealing that allows you to press or even clone the lamela so that the shoulder sleeps nicely "boot."
For men who have "rears across the back", definitely important thing.
They even remember it by the mattress producers who began to use the soft zone in the area of the shoulder.
Women also remember - they give soft surfaces in the hips.
For the most demanding customers, wing or distillation roasts are intended with so-called multitorzing.
The pressure is spread to more points and the voltage decreases.
But beware, as soon as you use the wrong pillow on the right mattress and pearls (big and "duced"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should sign the head and the tips to interfere only with the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
For example, 50 x 60 cm is recommended as suitable size, preferable in Scandinavia.
On the side climbing, the pillow should balance the height of the shoulder (with the shoulder collar of the pear or the soft zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original grass filled with grass.
Their producers are still more often using natural materials or at least substitutions.
Trend is just bio mattress.
Oil raw materials from which polyurethane foam is produced are replaced by natural oils, for example from the jump and soybean.
The soybean may have been used by all known producers.
"Bio in mattress means that the core is made of purely natural origin," explains Peter yourek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also have microcaps to relax the fresh scent of the forest or the lavender.
There's a breakdown for men and women.
While a man "impresses" a plant extract from the brick to absorb the mattresses and cool the body, women on the contrary, they're drowning.
The extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, so it's a weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made from cold foam (has larger pores with broken cell structure, is so much more prosque than normal polyurethane and offers even better elasticity.
Combinations of various fatties of cold foams and "linen" foams create multi-zone mattresses, which know exactly where the head, beads and heels should be.
You will pay from seven thousand crowns and above for quality mattress.
Those that meet the health parameters have a lower rate of VAT are taken as medical aids.
First in the Czech Republic, he reached the advantage of Gumotex.
Saving on mattress and pearl isn't easy.
Sometimes, such events can be used by manufacturers or vendors who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattress with all memory foam Memory into a trunk for 11 990 crowns.
But the other one can already be given free.
Éru lazy or viskoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density started the "cosmic" pace of material Temper.
He originally appeared as a material for NASA because at the starts astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
Temper softens in warmness, in the cold is ripening.
The warm human body is adapted perfectly and optimumly dissolves its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of leisures, but also to increase comfort while sleeping.
Viskoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as on special pillows underneath the legs that relax with the legs and the vein system.
For example, domestic producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similarly.
The equipment to track people wants more parents, so they want to charm their children.
Fear of his own child brings more people to the idea of watching over the GPS.
The system originally created for car search can also follow the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of Nine-year-old Anitka Janatková.
The device is so far large as a box of matches, but it can only be a watch.
Many people frightened the case of the missing angels and began to drink after means to protect their children better.
Even for the cost of disturbing their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that it is not a spy, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in some case, abuse of such equipment may occur, for example, when they put in a bag of someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't encountered a case like this."
"In most cases customers buy it for security reasons," said Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "crab" serves and how it is used in case of an emergency.
The child's psycho Dana Bočková warns that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like this, she'll just get rid of it.
"And very small children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose if they don't want to be under control."
"Great expectations have evoked mobile parents, but they can be switched off as well as these tracking devices," says Bočková.
According to it, it is also disputed whether in the event of assault, such an establishment would actually help.
"If it's a kidnapping, the perpetrator will make sure that the child doesn't have any electronics that could reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When they start expanding the tracking equipment, they'll be looking for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says a psycho.
However, it admits that similar devices may help in the event of improper assault with pedophiles.
According to Robert Bohemia from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, even if there is an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, it may help.
"The arrangements may be set for regular dispatch of the position after a certain period."
"If its damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Dear devices have an enclosure and accelerators, so even if a person just slipped and remained unstable, he sends the device immediately a warning with a position," says Czech.
According to him a similar service, smart mobile phones with navigation can also take place where they need to record a special software.
The problem of the current tracking units is that it is either a device similar to the trailers of the size of the matches or smaller mobile phones.
That's how their loss is always at risk.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why a device that looks like a normal digital watch is now being tested.
"It will have the greatest advantage in the fact that the possible aggressor doesn't have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he will know them after some time and it can give the police an extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are developed into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology that they use to guard cars.
This is a combination of detection of positions through the GPS system (which use normal autonavigation) and the mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army's got a burning line that he'll smother the Czech Republic, but it's only going to last two years.
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of strings that are exploding canvass.
Since last year, the Ministry of Defence has added 224 kilometers of strings.
That's how the army has stocks for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the cord is two, up to four years.
The army bought a burner line from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justification for the purchase of such a huge amount of inflammatory lines MF DNES, wrote that soldiers use 60 kilometers of burners per year in training.
However, from the calculations of the military pyrotechnics that the MF DNES addressed, it shows that all the generals, officers of command of the army, secretaries or cleaners, would have to go through a very intense pyrotechnic training every year.
The Minister of Defense of Alexandr Vondru and the Commander of the Army Vlastimil Pick is not excreted.
It would just be possible to justify the annual use of the army for 60 kilometres of lightning.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was really, the military supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that every new professional is sufficient to do at least two meters of the burner cord, as the experts say, so the army has provided fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of the gem or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
The soldiers of the Brigade of a rapid deployment recently complained to the Minister Vondre that they had almost no bullets in hand weapons, so there are limited shootings for money need.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"So I don't think they're buying a lot of burners from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they sure as hell know what they're gonna do."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we are trying to do as a businessman," says the business manager of STV Group Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometers of purchased strings even by the military having stocks of this "munica" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký ze STV Group only talks about the four-year life of the lighthouse and police or military pyrotechnics, even two years.
"In perfect storage, it may be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish a name for the criticism of the army.
After the end of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested whether it is still reliable and does not threaten the soldiers of life.
However, these tests are not free and costs more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a quantitative discount to 445 kilometers of burnt lines.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred fourty-five miles," explains spokesman Pejsek's opinion of the buyers' Ministry of Defense.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of the launch line of police pyrotechnics who are destroying ammunition from World War II or the Soviet army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only so much to use this ammo before the end of life.
It was good for the safety of the pyrotechnics, and it could also get more flexible to get more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence has already had considerable problems with the disposal of dozens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the Czechoslovakia army was prepared to pull to Rhine.
The Czech by the pyrotechnics that the MF DNES addressed is waiting for the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometers of old burners that "lacino" buys today.
To this day, I'm pulling out of contacts that I've gained thanks to the competition
The winner's position in the Živnostník of the year helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the Živnostník of the year became the eighteen-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberca.
His success story is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And in abroad, he realized that there was no quality accommodation in Liberec at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigade and using bank credit he bought a semi-developed house with five apartments.
For being a third-year student in college at the time, that was a great courage.
"This time's the ratio between quality and the price of accommodation with us, he didn't give me anything to do," says Luke Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment started renting to foreign workers.
All the profits he invested back to a house that gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years, he gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most complicated of them was a four-star Pytloun design hotel recently.
But another one came to him this year, as good as it is.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrova near Tisé, where we sold our francšízing concept and other interested in Pytloun's franchise is reporting," says last year businessman number one.
"And in this sale the hotel's license was largely involved in a victory in the competition of the Živnostník of the Year," says Pytloun.
Victory brought him more knowledge and popularity in Liberec and the surroundings.
"People knew me on the streets, often congratulated me further and I must say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
The competition definitely recommends everyone who's trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win, each visibleness is good.
He says he's been pulling out of contacts and knowledge that he might not have gotten to.
"With some who I met in the competition, I started to deal regularly."
The glory associated with the success he believes was a little bit of a result of every employee.
And he's got about 70s.
"I see more loyalty with them and the pride of being involved in something that gained general recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work all of us together."
"Only my name is cast to the forehead," says the modest Luke Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
Euphoria from victory quickly altered the impact of the crisis.
But due to the goal of the winner, Farmet has worse times over.
For the price for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Companies last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, arrived in the Slovan house last year.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts that he built from a small tool workshop in the Czech Skalice company with stamilione turnovers.
"I can say that appreciation encouraged not only me, but all my associates and increased our confidence in the competition struggle," says last year the winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered the father of Karl Žďársky to rent a small workshop as compensation for the Communists of confiscated property, he did not hesitate long, refused his career at the company where he worked, and with some friends around his dad founded a company on plastic baths.
Soon later, they started specializing in plant oil presses.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
A greater awareness among the outstanding public has been made to the company after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"One of our customers began to perceive Farmet's brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that achieved a greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
The last year, however, was not only in the pharmacy in the sign of the euphoria of the winners.
The valuation was based on the economic results of the company by 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year to sell engineering goods.
It has raised a crisis that has not yet touched citizens so much, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict the purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, has not avoided us."
"We have to reduce production, and we have been released," explains Karel Žďárský.
A life-sufficient company must sometimes be able to do such unpopular measures.
But they managed and kept the company profitable, even smaller than the crisis.
However, the investment in research and development is not discounted in the Farmet.
"We built a research and training centre, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, gained the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
It all suggests that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
Anket that removes non-resolute regulations
The Absurdit Anketa is the fourth part of the business clown.
Some nonsense regulations have already been revoked.
An unfamous winner of the next year's Absurdita surveys has become an obligation to carry documents that are also available online to officials.
She decided more than a third of less than four thousand voters.
For example, social security management required a paper statement from the business register, even if the official can get it by two clicks of mouse.
It's gonna change thanks to the survey.
"The Czech Social Security Management will no longer require a statement from the trade register in the case of insurance payers," said Ms. CSSR Jan Buraňová.
Enlighten all the regulations and regulations that firms and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to do, and the nonsense to cancel is the sense of the competition of Absurdita of the year.
This year is the fourth part of the business clown organised by the Economics News, and it is increasingly popular among the public.
If there were about 3,000 votes last year, 4,000 votes were no longer available.
And there's no wonder, the different legal obligations that are just for holding up the business, there's still enough for us.
"The number of lejsters for tax confession in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Central Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business becomes a failed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, in terms of business conditions, the Czech Republic has placed in the 74th position, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdita competition of the year was first announced in 2006 and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Reporting administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone every year from April to the end of September when the competition is closed.
For login, the website address www.firmaroku.cz Afterward, the competition organizer will select seven candidates for "antiquen" and will allow the public to vote for it during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdita who gets the most votes winners.
More than a hundred, more specifically 105 regulations and regulations lacking senses have been reported to this year's survey.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" contests, for example, the requirement for vehicles for maintenance of motorways and highways to be paid tolls, or for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals this year is published on the page of the competition.
The competition, which is always held at the beginning of November at the Václav Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Central Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic, assisted Eva Svobodová.
"Hospodary prosperity cannot work where the state throws the businessmen underneath the legs, so it is my goal to cancel every year at least three dozens of paragraphs that just unnecessarily complicate business today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to disrupt the meaningless regulation does not stand empty.
In 2007, the businessman’s obligation to report three days forward to the business office at the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention of going with a stand at the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation has been eliminated by a new trade law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was the report by the Office for his foreign staff of service travel within 30 days, was removed by the law on the so-called green card.
And to the third of all good things.
The Absurdity of 2009 became the regulation to the physiotherapys to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two sloppy weights in the office.
This has been mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen out.
New category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
The fifth year of the competition of the Economic newspapers this year is the category called Responsible Company in 2010.
The sending of this competition is the promotion of a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies in this way that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, who is a proclaimer and a guaranteer of competition as well as in the case of a rebellion of the year.
By this year's first year of this special subcategory, Vodafone's main competition in 2010, companies, for which success in business is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each one is very inspiring and would issue a separate article.
Although the subject of its activity is one from the other, the aid and consideration may be considered to be the common denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, people with disabilities and others, personal problems or health of their own employees.
For example, the Prague software company Et Neter, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who are then participating in a series of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the Pardubice company is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contribution of the Foundation fund sponsoring hendicapated children for 17 years.
The paperwork from Poděbrad has more than 70 percent about its disabled staff, and thus obtained the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and in the Vodafone Competition of the Year has been placed in the region as a third.
In Olomouck, the accounting company won MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, even reduced to average 35 hours a week but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The title of the jury also awarded it for the first purchase of Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to make our business and our administrations have the least impact on the environment," explains the actuator Milusz Ryznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecké region again thinks about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards to each notebook, supporting their work from home and its corporate events, using catering services provided by a local protected workshop.
"With this, we support the foundation of Man in a distress that helps specifically the local Roma community," says the representative of Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní and cleaning from the Karlovar region, which contributes to their employees in the form of surstandard bonuses.
"We give us back diet, transport, increase qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapač from the bruntal construction company Timech, winner in the Moravian region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Competition were automatically logged into the category of Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the question of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Inappropriate or incomplete questionnaire replies were then removed from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competition of the Responsible Company of the Year, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone Company of the year."
"The autonomous entry only in this competition is not possible because it is a subcategory of the company's main competition," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's organizer's agency.
Police arrested at the Land Fund in Pilsen during the public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzni, she arrested the anti-corruption police in recent days.
The detectives planted a local businessman in the media field and a businessman with real estates Luboši G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle the restitutional rights so that the land offered in the competition can be gained by a particular candidate.
That's what Luboši G was supposed to pay half a million crowns for.
"I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offence of the pleas in the public contract and in the public competition," said the law chief of Pilsen State Prosecutor Antonie Zelená, saying that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Sixty-thousand-year-old policemen released their freedom after 24 hours.
The way he could have influenced the public competition can only be speculated in view of the minimum official information.
The spokesman of the Land Fund Lubomíra Černá, on the right question, stated that the police actually arrested in a separate workplace in Plzni during the public competition.
"There was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to the Black Public Competition, the name "The call for the provision of ground transfer rights under the soil law" is right and is held where more legitimate applicants are interested in the offered land.
"These persons in the context of the challenge offer a higher value of their remnants to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the order of acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Luboš G. seems to have had information that joined the challenge, and because he is also a legitimate person, as he has purchased a number of restitutional claims, he has offered the landlord that he will not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he's incredibly erased the distance for that.
That would explain that he had so much money while he was holding.
Luboš G. had overstandard contacts on PF in Pilsen in the past.
In the case of former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing in replacement land restitution on which a decision on the location of the building has already been made.
That's when Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, the land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the arrival magistral was to become in the industrial zone Borská pole.
Later, he changed them very conveniently with the magistrate behind the house in the very historical center of the city, which had much higher value.
That's when the town hall had to come to it, because otherwise, by blocking the land, the building would be at risk.
Households pay hundreds a month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and slopes, the supply of heat and the rents will grow somewhere.
Since January, families will have to extract hundreds of crowns a month more than now from their wallets.
Electrification of health up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, until you have to pay a ten in some cities for water supply, and much also irritates the supply of central heat.
The healing of electricity should be the homes in apartments annually about the corridors of the corridor than now.
However, all main suppliers have decreased the prices of electricity, there is a significant increase in the production of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaics, on the blame.
Although the gas healths slightly, however, at a time when people toast most and have the highest consumption.
Therefore, hundreds of extra crowns must also be counted annually.
While electricity and gas health throughout the Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned for larger communities.
For example, homes in Pardubice or Hradec Kings will pay from January for central heating by about 50 crowns a month, they will pay for more than 1,000 crowns a year to the family in Liberec.
The people of Prague are again at risk that they are more than 9 percent of water and shipping health, if the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, the Praženo pays 6,8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still include a whole-republic comparison between lower.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it has a 7.4 percent water and roller coaster.
For example, the rent price may rise in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation has ended since January.
For example, CPI Flats, which in Ústí nad Labem owns about 2500 flats, intends to increase the rent of up to a hundred percent from January.
Those who won't agree to the new hire will put the company in court.
Regulated rentals that people pay around 300,000 flats could increase by up to 10 percent next year.
The Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is from fashion, acting slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally and better whiskey brand stolen by parents.
These are drinks, after which the drinking ends most often in the care of doctors, a drunk who has not yet been 15 years old.
The exception is not the children who are treated repeatedly from the monkey in the hospital.
It comes from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at hospitals' incomes.
"Some beers or wine are totally unfamiliar because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Trendem is definitely hard alcohol," said Prime Minister of Children's Hospital of Hořovice in Central Bohemia Ludzěk Pelikán.
"When they can pull a bottle to Daddy out of the closet, it's like whiskey, otherwise, but it's supervised by fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage that they pour it in the juice and there's no so much to feel," the prime minister explained.
And for the truth, the spokesman also gives him the University Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"For the most part, it's a fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases it was the slivovice they brought from home," said Jurin.
According to the Prime Minister Pelican, 13 or 14 years drunks in hospital income are relatively common phenomenon.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked ten years on a pediatrician in Motole, where ambulances bind undercutch schoolers from the wide area.
"One girl was lying with us about four times."
"The cariéra began in the 12 years when she was brought to us with 3.5 per mil of alcohol in the blood additionally in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a show in Holešovice at a dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't seem strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the prime minister said.
At the moment, parents’ disinterest or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring is considered the main cause of growing childhood drunkenness.
However, dependence in the right sense cannot be spoken by experts in children.
"The concept of alcoholics means a several-year chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomenons that belong to it, and that is not in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a remarkable non-social family background," said Prime Minister Pelikán.
According to spokesperson Jurina, this year at the paediatric clinic in Motole, they hospitalized some 40 drunken children by mid- November.
However, only those with severe intoxications that had to stay in the hospital will get into statistics.
Children's drunkers who take their parents away after an ambulance, or they can be transported home by the police, don't count.
In addition to the cases where children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of bulbs, there are three seasonal fluctuations according to Pelican, which can be relied on: witches, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"This will either drink the grief of the wrong testimony, or they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"I've seen seven children's drunks on the witches at once," said Pelikán.
The monkey who spends the night detoxating under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in advantage compared to the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover at home the other day.
In the morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are caused by induction infusions with glucose and nutrients that are missing.
"They are actually better at it because they have a good evening experience and a good awakening and nothing hurts them."
"Only they are confusing from where they are," Pelikán admits that sometimes he defects patients with a pleasant mood at least by reading the costs that they requested for treatment.
The transportation of ambulance and hospitalization into the acute bed will also come to tens of thousands of crowns.
"I sometimes used it as an educational means when I was directly to those children at the vision of how much their drunkenness was, and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to make money for the one party," said Pelican.
However, medical insurance companies according to him are subject to regression procedures in which parental costs for treatment would not be required in the cases of paediatric drunks.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two aircraft L-159 of the total five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS is headed.
It's the first time that machines of this type appeared owned by someone other than the Czech army.
They were only at exercises or demonstrations in the foreign country so far.
This is a two-digit version of L-159T1, which has still been operated by the Czech army and which have been airworthy.
The remaining three machines are L-159.
They are currently reserved in Aer Vodochoda and trade broker - Omnipol - took them over last week.
When the planes are physically expelled from the Waterfall, John Pejsek has not yet been known from the press defence department.
"The L-159 single aircraft for the change has been allocated from the long-term aeroplanes, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry."
"The two-digit L-159T1 were changed in the current state and form," said Pejsek Law.
He added that the army would not stay without two-digit aeroplanes because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth 200 million crowns to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two two-digit machines.
One new aeroplane took over in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Beijing, the EADS has committed itself to planting aeroplanes into the armor of some aliance country.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of L-159 aircraft is EADS and will serve for training of NATO pilots."
"That is why there is a customer's way of realizing this thing," said Pejsek.
The economic newspapers earlier indicated that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159 was not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 per plane Casa and the purchase of another three aeroplanes for 3.5 billion crowns last year approved the government of Mirka Topolánka.
The Ministry of Defence did not write to the purchase of a selection procedure and spoke directly to the EADS.
Today, defense leadership argued by supporting the future L-159 exports abroad by the exchange.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would want to sell.
The purchase of Casa's planes is likely to have a court-martial deal.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court because it should have chosen aircraft on the basis of a European tender and not by a single producer.
The army has already taken over three planes Casa, the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely within 14 days.
Longer insects than rings mean a lower risk of cancer
Men with an insect longer than a ring are exposed to a smaller risk of prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of the study published by the British Cancer Magazine on Wednesday.
It may be associated with male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men up to 60 years old," said Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Research of Cancer at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine who men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, added Eeles.
In 1994-2009, more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and more than 3,000 healthy men were monitored with their colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had an inflammatory on their right hand shorter than the rings.
She paid for them the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were equally long.
However, in the case of those who had an incinerator longer than the rings, this risk decreased by 33 percent, even 87 percent for men to 60.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - shaped during the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sexual hormones that the child is exposed in the matrix.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Earlier research has shown that testosterone is supporting prostate cancer.
The leading Czech genetician and former Chairman of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that he knows commonly about this study, but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer would be "full proven".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, most of the snows were driven by roads and roads all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89. and 93. kilometers in direction to Rozvadov due to several car accidents and passenger cars and also D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
Newspaper said that to the Central Carmotoclub (ÚAMK).
Two trucks fell down at 900 miles, an accident claimed an injury.
Several passenger cars also ended in the trunk.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
There were two cams.
Drivers should be on their way to Brno at 190 km or drive through Brno and then ride to the 182 km on the Cyclave.
There are severalkilometre columns.
There's an accident on D11, too, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a several-centimeter snow layer, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsia.
The wheels of cars are created, for example, on the Prosek, which is also covered by Štěrboholská.
The most secure means of transport is the metro.
Trams are late, for example, on the line between Karlovy náměstí and the Town of Peace.
At 8:00 a.m. a.m., Prague Emergency staff is supposed to meet again.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech tracks had to cancel seven fast connections because of snow.
Problems, for example, have a line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 hours at night to 5:00 p.m.
Most roads on southern Moravia are already high, but only with increased caution.
There are no three side roads in Vyškovsk, the seats in Brno are snow languages and in Blanensk are necessary to conquer certain communications in the above-level snow chains.
The most affected places belonged to Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed paths: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
We'll have to put the frescoes in their retreat.
When they're out, they can't be estimated yet.
In Hodonsk, care is needed in the White Carpat area.
On the roads, which are kept there for the protection of nature only by inert humidity, is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, the Czech Republic stated.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow, the most rained in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian Silesia region, it attacked about 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowing in the Czech Republic gradually stands.
American soldiers have a new "cluster weapon"
The American army put a new "chytro" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and the "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is something like a little super exact cannon.
Its projectiles are channeling a laser with precision to a few meters.
Special rounds of a calibre of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a high explosive rifle, actually operate as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed by exploding not only when impacting the target, but at any point of their ballistic track.
So it can be used against an enemy that hides behind any obstacle, behind the wall or in the hill.
Because Shora is not usually protected, and when the murderous rain of steel clamps can stand on him, it can remove it from the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in XM-25 development, the new rifle of the first weapon for infantry that uses smart technology.
"The soldier treats her in principle by finding the target, sends a laser beam to him, which determines the distance, so he gets a clarified intentional point, according to him, adjusts the direction and presses the cock."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun will charge and fire the gun at 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
400 jobs will be moved
The Fujitsu Concern will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace in July next year from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader suburbs in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In the middle, as the giant in the field, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, will move 400 men and women's workplace from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader suburbs in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the Fujist spokesperson, there should be another 100 jobs in the region at the earliest time.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and large space offices in Astro Park are more suited to the working way of staff.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
The competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is very important to the global society such as Fujitsu.
Recent moves of an important enterprise within the region led to joy last night with winners and disappointment in the losers.
The head of the economic referencer in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this managed to get a "global player".
It says it's a "fantastic expression of trust in this location".
They say Fujitsu fits the city, and the seating is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi, regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was reported to be informed in time by the company's management of his intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the problems of computer manufacturers with a property renter on Marienbader-City.
The result was the decisive economic reasons.
It is now about preventing a long stay in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and renter of the building will be cooperative."
The house in Rathaus-town, which used the Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" belonged ten years ago, together with other buildings on Marienbader-town to the most discernible construction plans of the spa town.
The railway station and the town hall were created as a joint project of the city and a private designer called urban entree, which was criticized, however, because of a massive construction of areas that previously served as a parking and also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company moved to the home of Feri's investment consultancy and rating, software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the manufacturer of the Fujitsu computers, which was then associated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu together acquired Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and after a year were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concerrn from Tokia is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers available and cares for the necessary service.
The branch in the region of Rýna and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the most employees of Fujitsu are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and the TDS.
The administrative building of Astro Park was rented for this purpose by 7,000 square meters.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the starry design, which is twenty-year-old, is located in addition to the central association of the electronic and electronic industry.
Amazon disables the server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting narrow.
Amazon Internet service has disabled the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that it happened on political pressure after the publication of hundreds of hundreds of secret diplomatic dispeakings.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly staying in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, the detection platform, gets under more pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, he called for the prominent American senator Joe Lieberman other countries and businesses to fight Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is in charge of the Interpol searched list, is to be held according to one newspaper contribution in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the Free Lands", the activists told Twitter to publish short messages on Wednesday (local time).
A short time ago, Amazon’s Internet company downloaded Wikileaks’ documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic transmissions in order to manage a high number of documents accesses.
With the Twitter service, Wikileaks explained to this step: "We will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after the co-workers of Senator Joe Lieberman made a search, published CNN television station based on Lieberman's information.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Defense threatened Amazon with a fightcot, informed the British "Guardian".
"I wish that Amazon would come to this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called to prevent the platform from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, incredibly and recklessly, and our national security is exposed to danger and threatened by life on the whole planet," said in one statement of a non-stranny senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should not help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by Swedish authorities because of suspicion of rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on the report in the London newspaper "The Independent" is held by the 39-year Australan in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has always referred to an investigation in Sweden as intrigued by his opponents.
Speaker Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"They were challenged to murder Julian Assang."
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson probably responded to the statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked for the responsible person to be published in Wikileaks for treason and executed.
In Canada, one counselor told Stephen Harper, probably ironically, Assange should be murdered, and Obama could use the target aeroplane.
Meanwhile, there was a gunshot between the White House and Assange.
The spokesperson of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "speakable and absurd" that Assange asked for resignation to the Minister of Foreign Hillary Clinton, if she was responsible for the recent spy calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than his website."
The US government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
A special commissioner was appointed Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorist Measures, Russell Travers, told the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "reforms necessary in the structure", which are necessary after the publication of the reports from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to explore how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that he wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were to get into danger because of the publication of Wikileaks.
"We submissed everything to get in touch with them," said the Foreign Minister Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them, if necessary."
Ice cream University
At the "Gelato University" at Bolona, ice cream candyers are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice creamers that last three days is great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where is the ice cream coming from?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, Czech a little outdated ice cream, makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes out a slice of ice cream from the cooling box, shakes it in the wafer and sells it.
In order to find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, it will not avoid the "Gelato-University" Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines set up an ice cream university to match the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days special courses for chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream.
Someone desires his Midlife-Crisis for a new career, others take the thin ice of their insecure desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the industrial Ice-Cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one of Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian woman in Julia's home arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also silk silk silkness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the Southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a notable dose of romance."
The first step in production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts basic milk ingredients, strawberries, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer, which heats everything by a 85-degree electronic program and then cools to four degrees.
Then they turn on the machine with a cock and runs pasterated white basic cream, the base of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The docent is immediately covered with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experiment alone?
Luciana warns to be carried away by a ghost of time until unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently also used stabilizers - most of the natural product such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will fall down and the customer will have the same ice grains.
Certain variations of basic matter are holidays.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes in the ice cream taste by ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the department with fruit or in the department of candy.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to force you to a lot of flavoured ingredients."
"You should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream from white base matter, which changes eggs to yellow cream and cocoa to the base for all sorts of chocolate temptation.
Now they can attend the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano always leaves them to produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and cherries - either with eggs or without them in basic matter, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is performed with fruit ice cream.
More flavouring substances, more fruit pyré - given the flavor, it's not always better.
Lovely ice cream doesn't have to taste more nuts when it contains more folic nuts.
The most popular ice cream from kiwi will produce a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only until the balanced mixture raises the right taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a purely numbered task: If a peach pyré is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, extra sugar is needed.
Luciano will remove an instrument which determines the content of the sugar in the fruit (such as swines measure the must of grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much body effort as it had before.
It does not only support an automatic production device of basic material.
There is also an ice cream machine, which simultaneously adapts to the cream and cools to the negative temperature.
Despite all automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo will pollute himself and also his colleagues from the top to down the fruit pyré when he gets out of control of a huge mixer.
"Every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time when something like this happens."
Two-light reviewers
The European Food Office of Efsa is linked to a industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been expressed by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an independent institution for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well", said on Wednesday in Munich, the chief of Testbiotech Christoph Then.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another expert of Efsa has been contracting with the Ilsi band for several years.
He's funded by concerts like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way in the Efsa control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interests, criticizes Then.
Efsa's rules are said to be consistent in all paragraphs with Ilsi's documents and thus carry a manuscript of industry that should be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech points to the conflict of interest.
Recently, the high manager from Efso has passed without supplements or temporary time to the Swiss agri-certain Syngent - and thus changed the parties.
Also, the Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has recently revealed a personal link between the EU-Inspection Authority and the Industrial lobby, which has raised interest in both the Ministry of Environment and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize the conflict of interests.
He works with all serious data, i.e. those of industry, if they are high-quality, is listed in one statement.
Experts who work for Efs are not required to be in contact with the industry.
But they have to add.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It itself is referred to as the neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - in addition to the risk assessment of biotechnology without the lobbisty contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that they are currently genetically modified plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and that the reaction of genetic plants on the effects of the environment is not tested.
"We want to know what genetically modified maize will do, for example," says then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how could they be found?" he asks the prosecutor then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
The research worker has examined the gentechnic since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry as well as in the US is attempting to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who would not be connected to concerts.
Most of them do not publish studies that are critical to companies.
"The idea controls security research," believes Hilbeck.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 pounds.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tub on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: in September the bagers arrived and began to throw a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands were demonstrating against S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the construction stopped, most wings were in the wreckage.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Cruilsheim vapour, soft rough stone, which was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of these pieces.
"These rocks are relics."
"He can't disappear."
"Lighty and poor stone, simple and original."
When he cut one, he smelled like a cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with those pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The footprint of the stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former depopulation of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all the people that were born during the crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed into a barrel or disappeared to a deporium," he says in his office, a wooden booth, which was an earlier watch house.
He tells him that they put him on and threatened him when in September all the newspapers stood to buy the remains of the North Wing from the company that executes the demolition.
But he's been talking to the opponents of S-21 all day.
And he explained that he couldn't be behind the demolition at all.
And now that it's happening, then it's the most understandable thing when the stones continue to use.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents every one of about 80 pounds a heavy block, a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some of them also hope to return it in reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 large trucks.
Maybe half's still in the woods, the rest of them sold out a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all over the corners and pulled away what fits into the trunk and the trailer.
Stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long been transformed into "crowds" or as the edges of herbs.
"This stone isn't really special," he says Rongen.
"If it wasn't the political drawer."
He's in his field car and heading for a ride after his 20 hectare kingdom.
First he studied rights, breaks study, later biology, then he was interested in computers, and eventually became a rock dealer.
And a rock lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones.
He's taking his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest man with old stones in the Republic.
He's shy.
In the snow there is an artisticly worked sandstone.
"They belonged to Marien-most in Dresden," he says.
The sandstone from Labe, yellow, warm, thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We're moving on the way up through the woods.
It points to the pile: red sandstone, earlier part of the Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Nice travertin."
Once they belonged to the Neckarstadion tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from a police presidency in Stuttgart, red granite from Sankt Blasien Temple, a tub from a hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones broke manually and transported with simple hammers and bull cars, it becomes completely respectable.
"It would have been a scandal if something like this had been crushed."
He hasn't become rich, very rich any more.
However, a stone dealer employs 14 people today and, besides, he settled up in the woods, a sculptor, one sculptor, one glasser and one gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says whoever evaluates the residues.
He has to go to Cologne at the earliest time.
There will also save stones.
Fighting talents for High Potentials
There's a lot of people at the refreshment.
16 students are pushed by salmon breads, tomato soups and candy.
Technical University in Braunschweigu and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students to engineering and workshop design.
Together with VW developers, they have to talk about the car of the future - and, by the way, to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying at the smartest head race, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, to recruit the earliest graduates before they get to the labour market and will be interested in others.
Since universities do not give any lists of successful students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in projects oriented to practice and acquire them.
On TU Braunschweig is trying to get the car company's talents the second day.
One young lady from the personal department gives pens, rubber bears and plates with VW logos.
He tells the promising young talents about the programmes on practice, student jobs and suggests routes to the company.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with the VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and get experience."
"The VW can at the same time meet students, meet interesting candidates, and think about who would like a coworker."
Such co-operations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
But the news is that he's so openly fighting for students.
"Because he was a more important professional project," he says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies no longer can choose their employees from long crowds of candidates.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly qualified workforce.
First of all, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German engineers' Union data, the VDI remained in October unattended 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the prediction of the VDI, the lack of engineers will grow.
Roman Dykta is hunting talents for the auditor and consultant KPMG.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, the kind of modern treasure race, where participants must find a way according to GPS coordinate.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can also check KPMG branches and meet the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many candidates will fly to the US.
In the High Potentials fight in universities, according to the Dykty, the harder laws will apply.
"We want our Race different from the others."
"The single swimmer trip was too little for us."
Looks like a Dicta talent hunter is lucky.
"We've stayed in touch with all participants like this last year."
"There are some going to be a study soon and they're planning to go to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented classically on labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"For example on Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, head of the staff department of the Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonn company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are written on the company's website.
"Now it's just complicated to occupy free places."
"It's a lot of time and money," he says.
Another possibility is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors inform that we can do practice or write a diploma job."
Solar specialist doesn't organize any expensive advertisement.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"The big concerts can't often offer it," says the head of Stübe's personal department.
For a long time, the money has not played a major role in finding a job.
Flexible working time, child care or good options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld took over a study of the Great Place to Work 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up a yearly list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks coworkers how happy they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The manager of Stübe's personal department hopes that the location will bring points to her in the employment interests.
"I believe that the applicants are informed in particular of the external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this mainly means internal action.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer leads through its own employees," he says.
It's called the internal employee Branding, which is the deployment of the employer on the market within its own employees.
"Happy employees are the best emissaries."
When the company cares well for their people and they identify themselves with the company, then they're gonna do advertise themselves to their employers among friends and friends.
"It's like a game with a string," he says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drills
During the following years, the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico will not rise in new oil drills.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding prohibition, thereby canceling the previous plans with final effect.
Also before the Atlantic coast, the new drills are forbidden.
Minister of Interior Ken Salazar told me on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which should be paid for at least five years, is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drill tower in April.
Before this misfortune, which cost eleven employees of life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure of opposition and industry's willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Contributors try to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Today, it is not clearly explained who bears responsibility for the destruction of oil in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British Energy Conservation of BP, which is confronted with billions of applications.
Obama's investigative committee should submit the results in December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar canceled the drilling ban that he paid from the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil concerts submitted applications for new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters with stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At the moment, the control authority has substantially reformed itself, which has brought attention to many of the corruption charges.
At the same time Obama announced that it would abolish the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
Industry now openly warns that more stringent regulation will substantially decrease the volume of oil spent in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the largest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry", the result of the current survey in the field of BDO - even before the curriculum on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation changes."
Investments in new mining projects are moving at the expense of growth until the appeal.
The area of Ogoni burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like the pump: billions of liters of evaporated oil have destroyed nature in the area of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People live with stealing, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestin Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," calms the ecological activist journalists: "Today you'll get enough oil mud before the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerians watched the attempt to photograph a boy who beards on the breasts of water surrounded by smuggles: the scene works in a water gloss with rainbow colours almost as nice as it is.
The fact that under the surface the brown oil clots swim is not seen.
She used to collect enough garnel in the containers, tell Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, slowly flowing water completely dead.
Five years ago, it spilled into a huge flange area from a broken lead of a large amount of oil.
The fishermen of the nearby town of Bodo must fall for at least six hours to reach the waters where fish are: the region of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger delta river belongs to one of the worst infected areas in the world.
The whole range of triggers is only known on the way along the river with mangrowce swamps with a lot of side flows.
The motor on the boat cooks instead of light water with brown cough and who puts his hand in the water draws oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrants are rode out of the country like black bars of pharmaceuticals, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sadly hanged.
We're looking for a flock of birds that usually occur in wet areas: As soon as the engine shuts down on the boat, it's going to blow up in the former paradise where it smells like the pump, scary silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological leadership of war," says Celestine Akpobari sadly, "We live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with the war is justified.
The area of Ogoni's seat has been a battlefield, where it has been fighting for decades: for more than 60 years ago, the first conquests from Europe have been recorded here, there in the 1980s, the first resistance with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the company Shell had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while daily spending from the entire delta area with three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 mining drills and 7000 kilometers of leading more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the area of Ogoni by lad, for the company is too unstable.
Every few hundred meters, the steel construction of the water, such as bizarre statues, "Child trees," is called the heads of drilling holes too tenderly.
They're 50 years old, most of them are resuscitated.
Every moment, the head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then the constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to the estimates of experts, more than two billion liters in the delta ecosystem for 50 years: every year, the amount of oil that came into the sea at Alaska in the supertanker accident "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes that continue to be responsible for ecological disasters.
While the company Shell refers to sabotage and organized theft of oil for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors speak of the cracking heads of drills and unsatisfactory lines as a major cause.
Shell demands much less security regulations in Nigeria than in the world's habit, said the company in 2008 US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only a number of lines disorders is said to be "more than others".
In a place that looks remotely abandoned, oil-stained workshop under the wide sky, the figure mangrimages are emerged: they are completely naked and to the neck of oil.
Under one of many barrels, which are partly connected by the leadership, partly distributed around the earth, burns fire: illegal small refinery.
Oil warms up in a barrel over the fire for hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, he leaves from the lead to the catchy pot of gasoline, later a cap at the end of the kerosine line and finally naphtha.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters every day: "We'll make $34.000" - around $22.
Residents of delta use chronic deficiencies in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
A mixedly low price of EUR 40 per litre of oil can still be overloaded by illegal producers: because they have free raw material.
It comes from "bunkers" who join the leadership everywhere in Ogoni: according to experts, the entire Niger delta area loses the country every day at least 16 million liters of oil.
But only the negligible little part of the provizorly stored raw materials is illegally deprived: the largest share of the organised criminal networks to be included in politicians and highly positioned leaders of the army, to tankers and sell it to the world market.
The debate on whether the residents have caused a disaster and their interventions or a lax method of production, the activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
"If oil companies were not considered intruders, and if they had not destroyed the life of fishermen so perfectly, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refinery."
Meanwhile, however, the relationship of Ogoni is especially so humiliated with Shell, that only the departure of the company is considered: "They may show other nations like the Chinese as better."
Michael's gonna get upset.
"The best time to disappear," says the muscle producer.
"Every minute, soldiers can come."
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't be in danger of prison, but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers who usually come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from raw materials.
"The cursed thing got our ground in all respects to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in the A380 engines
A380 obviously has a major security failure.
The investigators found a possible construction error in the engine tour that had landed emergencyly, which could lead to a catastrophic engine failure.
Qantas Airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas airbus travellers had probably more luck at the start of November at the emergency landing, which was known to us: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety failure on the engines of certain A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns about a possible construction error.
Perhaps the failure would have a severe consequences: on one oil connection, cracks could arise for wear, this Thursday in the published ATSB statement.
This could lead to a catastrophic engine failure.
These are engines made by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them there is also a Qantas airbus that had to land emergencyly in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British Turkish producers.
He filed a justification for the action of the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows further legal action against this company.
The head of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would request compensation for an incident at the beginning of November.
Parts were released during the engine fire, and the parts were damaged by the nasal areas.
Rolls-Royce referred to as the cause of damage to the burning oil.
After this event, 40 engines must be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further security tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said spokesman ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency has been considered to be important enough to inform all of the concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline has left its fleet A380 for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa switched the engine to one A380 as a security measure.
Two-story aircraft is the biggest personal plane in the world.
The national snow will cause chaos in transport
Germany all in white: almost in the whole country snowed overnight.
There are chaos on many roads, connections of trains and planes being disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: almost the whole Republic fell on Thursday at freezing temperatures by snow - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several highways and many roads there is a strongly restricted transport.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still deployed, but she couldn't handle the new snow.
There was still a strong blowing wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Joint Authority for the cruise and hydrography (BSH) is waiting for a stormy shore at the coast of the Baltic Sea in Šlesvik-Holstein in the morning with a water condition of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snow curtains have caused significant problems in Saxony on highways and state roads.
According to the centres of the bad weather, Meteomedia was therefore a degree of alarm on the purple - at all.
From the part there, it attacked 30 centimeters of the new snow, the strong and fresh winds caused the veils.
A few cars and passenger cars remained there at night.
Also in Saska-Anhaltska, the police reported a lot of road trouble.
The A2 caused the wind and the snow slow operation and suction.
There were troubles in Duryn because of snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German track, there are major problems in Saxony, Saxony-Anhaltsk, Duryn and North Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on tracks, twisted trees on tracks or broken upper lines and rinses.
There must have been a remote operation in Saxony from Lipska to Norimberka.
In the Danish Saalfeld, one ICE had to stop to Munich.
165 passengers received firefighters and paramedics with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
The snowy wind was over the road.
Many years have been cancelled on large German airports because of snow winds.
According to the spokesman's headquarters for information about years have already been reported from Munich's cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt nach Mohan, the Fraport spokesman has been repealed for 40 years.
The maintenance of the roads is in constant deployment.
There are only few passengers left at the airport without connections, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
One truck driver died at the downstairs with a train on the rail crossing in eastern Holstein.
The engineer was easily injured.
Due to the snowy road there was a similar accident near Norimberka: there was also a truck captured on the rail crossing because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Norimberk remained closed until morning hours.
And a 30-year-old woman died after she turned to a slip road at Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, the meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of a light question, and that is why the wind will rise even in light porns.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea will the fast winds of the strength of the wind.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for two towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the main office in Frankfurt.
Inability could amount to up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters of the company: the two towers in the French banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have had their old jobs again.
But now he seems to want the financial corporations to renovate again - and he is looking for a buyer for both the marbles, as says "Financial Times Deutschland" with appeal to the spokesman.
The speaker didn't name the reasons for the sales planned.
"We are constantly investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell properties and then to rent again," he said.
Thus, the largest credit institution in Germany is renounced once again after a short period of time.
The Bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of the own fund and then renovated them costly.
Energy reconstruction has swallowed around EUR 200 million according to data.
I guess the sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts from the field estimate the value of the "Greentowers" to the cost of around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper text.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be resales to the assets of the fund or an independent investor.
Thousands grieve for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the monument of the fallen miners in New Zealand, who have been declared dead after several explosions down.
Still haven't been able to release the dead because the safety situation is still complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were inflamed downstairs.
There was no probe in the shaft where there was disaster, but there was no trace of life.
Due to the high concentrations of poisonous gases and the following explosions, the safety of the rescue forces could not come down.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts were based on the fact that miners had no chance of survival.
Still haven't been able to free the dead.
Now they worshiped the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, the southern island of New Zealand, 10,000 people gathered in sunny weather.
They've been silent for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, lamps, and the name of the miners were built to worship the monuments of the fallen miners.
Also pictures and personal things, like clothes and surfing boards found their place here.
There were flags in half-frank flags in government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come back from the "depth of the country" on the surface, said to the participants of the memorial event minister John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swooped downstairs.
Remembrance took part in several foreign diplomats, except the Prime Minister and the related victims.
During the explosion of 19 November, British and South African miners were also inflicted.
Rescuemen started by burning fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases are dissolved, it starts cooling high temperatures inside the mines, he told the journalists the police president Gary Knowles.
Damn it, warriors!
Is it a horror for an art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is attempting to regain the old boundaries with his battle epose "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he was filming "Walhalla Rising"?
The captive Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from his tortures and in great killing with almost supernatural strength of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young male viewers who are looking for bloody action, because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and their enemies even their innerities from the belly alive when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-One, as it is actually called, will not say a word throughout the movie, and even the other figures will deliver at least one or two sentences, or they will be pushed to the stubborn dying shouts.
Otherwise, they are silent and sinned in a terrificly beautiful hillside landscape of Scotland, offering a scene of the world of Vikings about thousands of years ago.
The film is ideal for adult enthusiasts of the cinema with interest in existencialism and very quiet videos of the camera.
It's good when the film has more target groups, it's just a shame when they rule out each other.
The director of Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy on drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantina, stands standing, but defending himself to bring his work closer to either the humor of the mainstream or less brutality of the art audience.
Most of the artists' cinema seem to be distracted everywhere by squirring brains and innerities.
The leaders of action films are tired not later than when the One-eyed is released for freely explained reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will remain hanging forever in the windless and mistress, before it seems to come to America and continues to remain silent.
No wonder in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get into the cinema and was now released only on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the wonderful shots, but also because it's a personal facade, places up to the collected blood, it hides an exciting cinema, which deserved a little attention.
This film is not about dialogues or accurate events, everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn will not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly strangle him with his freezing shots and a cloudy hypnotical soundtrack, especially the insignificant hatred that says from the heart of characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-One will keep something like an innocence, all the others are driven by an evil.
Of all the most elephant heroes whose motives will never be explained, which will become the time for enemies and transitional allies by a warrior from hell, perhaps the Messenger of the Devil.
He's making ruins, maybe, but only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
A pleasure.
Mysterious earthwork
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has a new warning to the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the earth is prevented from expression - and will not allow control.
About midnight from September 6th to September 2007, at least four Israeli battle aircraft F-15 I will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrat; the nearest larger town is 30 kilometres away and its name is Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA) the name appears when it is a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley that is turning away from the current.
On the basis of the US-American Secret Service of the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village el-Kibar, was well thrown into the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
A 50-year-old tech would be no good for anything else.
The CIA was presenting a video with unaffected satellite images.
By means of computer animation, it explained where the components of the reactor before destruction could have been, it should be a reduced copy of the North Korean nuclear model of Yongbyon.
In addition, the photographs were still submitted that showed the building close to or even from the inside.
He said the reactor was shortly before the launch, but without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after bombing, they don't know much more than that, even the puzzles of time have grown.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memories that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building in an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some rapporteurs in Europe are even more careful and they only talk about an efficient reactor, even though they consider the CIA's presentation "confidential".
They miss clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
On the question of how certain he has a reactor, he answered a high UN diplomat in the summer, the IAEA has said that "sufficient material to ask questions".
The "unused military buildings" allegedly was the Syrians quickly dissolved and also properly aligned the terrain.
Yet, he managed to find the IAEA team in June 2008 under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar the footprint of uranium, which was made by humans.
In addition, IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial dealers from the time to time after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not marketed because they are exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria always claimed that she had never had a secret nuclear program and didn't even build a reactor.
Uran comes from Israeli weapons, expressing himself to Damascus.
But that's what turned the IAEA off after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss things, just like the satellite footage.
In addition, he forbids revisions of the second inspection in the el-Kibar and access to the wreckages of the demolished building.
But also Israel keeps silent.
"We will never comment on this", recently confirmed the official opinion at the time of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has been unsurpassed since June 2008 and "increases to a serious problem in view of the credibility of the Authority", as the High Western diplomacy at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - it is a serious violation of the nuclear weapons ban that the IAEA is supervising.
The IAEA considers it a key to progress in the case of another three devices to be "in functional connections" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it still exist.
The auditors have not yet indicated either the device or the function they have or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA is inter alia referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, brought again by close cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images of buildings, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA access to these three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent to the US in advance to seek military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the U.S. Secret Service facility.
The IAEA has foundations and satellite images that between these three places and the squares at the Euphrat transported the material here and there.
In Vienna, the high west diplomat said that at least one contracted should be "in connection with fuel production".
But there are no "no evidence of sensitivity", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; the processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where this uranium comes from, and where it should be later dissolved by the plutonium on the bomb, there are only probable estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the wreckages that could hide important tracks are stored in these three places.
As if they disappeared from the surface of the Earth's hundreds of costs of trucks, no one seems to have the information where the nipple came from.
Only a few kilometres away from the el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrat lying the salt mine of al-Tibni, which allowed Syria to check as an appropriate warehouse for radioactive waste in 1998, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Earlier inspector IAEA Robert Kelley put him in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the images from the universe show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out the work of the earth in all suspicious places and removed the large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help explain the suspicion.
In addition, the diplomatic circles are talking about that the IAEA has spent many months drawing up a review plan that would allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets - only this effort shows the great interest of the auditors.
In the meantime, Damascus refused this proposal.
If, a year ago, they calmed the Western diplomats in Vienna that the reactor is destroyed, and therefore it does not burn, the Ambassador of the United States Glyn Davies speaks of so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest resources that has the Vienna Nuclear Authority to enforce controls.
The chief of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who had to propose an inspection, already spoke of the "possibility that I'm afflicting in the future", but so far hesitates.
This option is at risk: On the one hand, most of the IAEA Governing Council are needed and many of the 35 countries represented are not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, how does one diplomat warn: "What happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love at the time of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working in the summer, there's been a problem with the still nameless primitive director.
She wrote the script herself, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and the man from Serbia.
There's much more to know yet, but it's also causing restlessness.
They are constantly talking about the woman who is Muslim will fall in love during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bossen women protested immediately, so the planned shooting from Sarajev to Hungary has moved quickly.
In the meantime, the film was made in Hungary and is in postproduction, but in Bosensk it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN-organisation to help the refugees of the UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, now informing the Bossen newspaper - Jolie is also an UN-organized ambassador to help refugees.
It's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a week ago to meet in Hungary, which they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where the rape was raped, the love stories did not do, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals enough about the script.
Therefore, her organization recommended the UN-organisation to help refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, inform Guardian.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bossen Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, allowed smaller tahanics in Sarajev's filming - is not quite clear why Jolie did not come yet.
The young author stresses that in her film there is no political intent that she has dealt with the conflict in Yugoslavia that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give space to all stakeholders.
In view of the content, it remains indefinite.
There's another version of the film on the internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the beginning of the war, and they meet once again when she's like a Bosnian Muslim put into the Serbian camp, where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds different than "the rape victim will fall in love with his martyr."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war is true.
Jolie suggests that the pressure on her is being raised, which is "not fair and based on misleading information".
Now they can release her already are hectares from Hollywood: by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done so many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening is once again good for Iry.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates too much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans screaming joy for sound loud music, ass legs.
Bailey-Pub in Southeast Corka blows up because players throw tennis balls on a distance of three meters to beer cups - and hit.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and for that ticket to Las Vegas to the world championship in a beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screamed beer game and a restraining informative, that doesn't make much together.
Yet, a 26-year-old man is trying to entertain himself from a difficult question that will bring the future.
His plan is not playing passion in Las Vegas, he's in January for a New Zealand interview.
"I have such a weird feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there."
Yet, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She has obtained her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Two of the three Tanner siblings have tried their happiness abroad because of the wrong prospects of home.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as IT consultant in London.
The boys leave, like Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100.000 Irish leaves the country at the earliest time, predicted by experts of the Scientific Institute for Economics and Social Affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They even count until 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small land with only 4.5 million inhabitants, it is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, a similar exile wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980s will occur.
For decades of the rise that brought great well-being to Ireland, displeasure is now expanding again.
The economic crisis highlights young, educated Ira, who have experienced only an increase.
The loss of employment and social retreat seemed absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, there are three out of ten women and men under thirty years without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters of readers who complain, "In Ireland, everything goes from the hill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away, and our land loses the whole generation."
"Leave the lights, please."
Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish student union, sees the future blackly because the government only deceives and offers no views to the future.
"They have a minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates swing from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, work abroad is an excellent opportunity to make first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website there are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: working abroad are not galleys, but freedom and joy.
He knows what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months, Sean O'Donovan.
Since 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he's going to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home a loan for the house.
"Situation is sometimes a little crazy," he says, when the first time after a long time, it crosses the threshold of his own house.
"I'm living money in Germany for a house in Ireland, which I'm basically not in at all."
She laughs embarrassed and walks through cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with a kept garden, there are large expensive cars in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago in EUR 380.000 - 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions," he says.
Is she worried that it wouldn't have to make a good deal with the loan?
O'Donovan's thinking for a while, and he's putting hot tea down, and he says, "I don't have kids I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn't like scrubbing that he hears so often now.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not quite as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"It's not the worst thing we can do to work abroad for a while -- maybe we'll just feel like the Irish."
She laughs and then tells about her father who left for the last economic crisis to England.
"After seven years he was back again, and life went on in Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait for life to evolve elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be good in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But there's one more thing that really bothers him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might get screwed up at a bachelor party.
"Deeply no emotions," he says, and he drinks a beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a party of departure, quite simple, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Continuous practice of democracy
Democracy support in Latin America is growing as well as support for private business.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more powerful than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and came exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been regularly conducted since 1995, changes in positions across the whole area can be monitored.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things are dominated.
First of all, Latin America has quite a happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
Democracy support in several countries at the border of Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is an average of 6% per year since 2002, the aid for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
She also grew in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the questions asked in Mexico and Brazil, two human areas, are the democratic beliefs, which downloads the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents across the area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, is a large increase (point 3).
A total of 34% indicated that they trust the House in their country and 45% trust the government, again they are the same numbers as last year, but it is a great difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy undermineed the economic crisis in Latin America.
The support was likely created during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, a stronger social security network helped to protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% in this year.)
However, the attitude is changing in a wide range from the country to the ground (see Chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its departing President Luize Inácia Luly da Silva is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime has worsened.
Only the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America are seen as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% says that either they or their close relatives have become a crime victim last year, but this is a decline compared to 38% of last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the whole area says that private business is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% from 2007 (see Chart 6).
Approximately 58% agrees that the market economy is the only system that allows their country to develop, this percentage has increased from 47% of last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leadership in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (as compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States are considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and in the large part of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nikaragui.
Criticalised elections
No one expected the general elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to fear.
The elections meant a full-fledged urn and recurring vote, voting posts broken down by channels, broken election rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haiťans, including many moved because of the ice earthquake, were wandering around and trying to find out where they could vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several predicted predecessors, yelled that this was a fraud and called after the elections were cancelled.
Protests, some of them were violent, spread all over the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a highly built UN official in Haiti, said that "it was a pretty good choice in many respects."
Observers from the United States and the Caribbean community carefully said that "he does not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority, whose opposition votes are obliged to René Préval, the unpopular departing President and his candidate, Jude Célestin, shall notify the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive fight is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former first lady, have resigned from their original challenge to be declared void.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support between the voters, is identified by the election committee for reaching a decisive fight.
Because of a hell of a epidemic, and more than 1 million people who still live in tents after earthquake, feared that the election participation would be low.
In the end, many Haiťans wanted to vote, but because of the deorganisation they were prevented from doing so.
Some 250,000 IDs that are necessary for the vote remained unseparated shortly before the elections.
It's a lot of stakes.
The donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear that the Haitians are going to do it themselves.
After the tips to the center
During the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, a Argentine president, has benefited from a public sympathy when her popularity has increased from 20 to more than 50%, since she was elected in 2007.
Still, reversing this success in a successful campaign for the second term of office in the next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernandez will give up the inconvenience of her late husband, the predecessor and political partner of Néstor Kirchner.
And all of these significances will be founded.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had in the habit of making budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional revenues according to pity.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost the majority last year in Congress.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at Mr. Kirchner's death on a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the Peronist political movement have joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (in which the government was accused of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for the next year, with the president will have more space to spend according to liby.
Economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate now reaches 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about a figure that is approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina was experiencing economic collapses, set priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the INDEC, a statistical agency that joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernandez now die this policy?
She called for negotiations between private enterprises and professionals.
And her officials say they want to reduce wage growth to 18% next year.
Economy has been supported by the growth of world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation has distorted growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández has known that she wants to restore the Argentine financial bonds to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government made an agreement with the bond holders who previously refused the restructuring of the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
The President Fernández is now facing a agreement with the creditor governments that are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted on not having this fact over the IMF, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer-censorship index to remind the introduction to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to stay in politics after the end of the term of office when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of cyrchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentinians from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall down.
If he wants to win another choice, he will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to break down quietly many views that her husband held in politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to connection to the land.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother over the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the legitimate, voted for Mayors and councils of the city on 27 November in five urban districts, which can be considered to be a wider evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is the leader of the feelings that dominate the land and have a strong engagement in business relations, including a part-free trade agreement, in the largest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but just close.
Although his side Kuomintang (KMT) ended with the winning of three of the mayor's five offices, she could not win most votes.
In addition to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has increased the independence of Taiwan, it has gained almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were the presidential election, the President would have had trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the vote of his party decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with the KMT in city councils.
The elections were played as most of the Taiwan elections, including loud election cars and mass meetings with flags, which will be saved by girls.
There was even a compulsory mysterious attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, an honorary chairman of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates in the pre-elections.
The man from the crowd shot Mr. Lien purely over his face, hurt him and killed the viewer.
It was not bizarre to determine whether the armor was going to injure Mr. Lien or to deal with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of DPP, claims that the shooting influenced the election, suspicion falls on DPP and leads voters towards KMT.
Perhaps the only big campaign winner was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates scrambled on plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys his de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
KMT therefore has a tendency to avoid vacancies on the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also dropped from stimulating anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and realization that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
President Ma confirms that China's policy is acceptable for most Taiwan.
From the Beijing Government, it can be expected that it will continue to continue in commercial bribes, together with its strategy to attract Taiwan back to the herd.
China did not waste time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to establish a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Surely they would also like to see political integration, but first.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a robber and advocate of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for the president, such as Su Tseng-changem, who held the office under Mr. Chen.
Their side now does everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes which serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that they can be held without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taivanian public that her party represents a "confidential alternative" to the challenging approach of Mr Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In his duties, he expressed the opinion that the DPP candidates would be better if they insisted that Taiwan was a country of individual.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist not to run for the president.
But without Mr. Chen's intervention, DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were bad, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; KMT candidates didn't want to go to the campaign with him.
Its displeasure seems to be based in particular on unemployment and deepening disgrace between the rich and the poor.
Speaker KMT says he'll reorganize his cabinet as well as the local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwan citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonia Chianga, the prominent publicist, "the point from which no return has passed."
Grammy Prize nomination: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category the best new artist
The speech at the request of the President and people must notice the legality.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and a singer President Obama chose to perform on the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is referred to as one of Grammy's surprises in this year with nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came a little late, but it is in line with the rules of Gramma, when the artist must not issue more than three albums before "it is established by the public identity of the artist."
Her ambitious album of 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to its careless vocal style and humble hand with elements of pop, fungi and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the voter in Grammy, looking for similar jazz work in this category in the last years.
Other judges Grammy appreciate the Vijay Iyer Trio "History" album in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of the experienced saxonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and the keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a christened favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in the HBO show "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise adhered to Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk has gained several merits in the category of large files, where in competition the chamber jazz of Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octopus "Pathways" has created a beautiful example of how bassite can have free hand as a band.
Nomination Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classical music category
The nomination on classical music has a wide picture of musicians and composers from all over the world on the 53th annual prizes.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", eclectic orchestra, with a number of three points.
Among the nominated members of South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted in Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to award.
Nomination in classical music is divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, congregation and solo recordings.
The category for the manufacturer of classical music of the year has five nominated Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was awarded by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" showing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the category of the opera, the nominations are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated for the Grammy for the courtroom compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered in Disney Hall in January 2009 for the performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen tax.
Approximately 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for an instrumental performance by the soloist with an orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said that he wrote a 15-minute work specially for the mandolin interpreter Avi Avitala, who performed on a concert with Metropolis Ensemble with a headquarters in New York.
"I wrote it through tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," said Dorman in a phone conversation.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, received nomination in category for orchestral performance, with the head of Chicago Symphony in recording the work of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental solists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; warrior Paul Jacobs; violin Julia Fischer; and harp Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists this year only women were represented by Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, the nomination of the sopranicist Jessy Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecule receives approval from the planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours often a passionate public testimony.
The critics attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to trade suspension.
However, the jurors decided on the Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, the chairman of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of this as an American citizen."
"It makes justice always win."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are opposed only shouting loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting started at six o'clock in the evening and it took almost midnight when most of the time took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were equally divided, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no America anymore," one comment appeared.
"We're the planet of monkeys with the Statue of Liberty fallen into the sand."
"America's down."
The planned Islamic Centres also triggered protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, the places of tragedy held on September 11, 2001 when the terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community, counting about 135 families, used for years without incident, but wished more and more suitable space than the warehouse space that he rented together with the filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque with dimensions of 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minaretes and grows up to 43 feet.
It should take a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents may still refer to the City Council on the project.
Microbeams with resistance to arsenal increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
Discovering a strange bacteria that can use arse as one of its nutrients, extends space to search for new forms of life on Earth and maybe even further.
Researchers discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claimed that it was a sign that life has the possibilities that stand outside the main elements that have yet been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a double ability."
"It can grow either due to phosphorus or arsenal."
"This fact is very special, but it is not evidence that this is a form of really 'mimozemic' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies from Arizona State University, a co-author of the report that appeared on Thursday on the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake in California are able to continue to grow after the arsenic replaces phosphorus.
"It will start to amaze you what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, the co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, caused widespeculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of an alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider "standard" may not be absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake, because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so it considered that the microb that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one another.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"Nevertheless arzene is so different that as phosphorus does not work. When it gets into the body, he starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exhibit them an increasing concentration of arsen that are bacteria able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but given that they can also survive with an arzene replacement, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic can appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or on a month where the arzen is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a professional microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, declared that the idea of arsen that could be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but there was never an example on which this fact could prove.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, said, and so scientists speculated that they could use it as earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could be other ways of creating life, not just the way he created in the early period of Earth," said Foster, which was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute
The rest of the stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two akits and the big pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, where they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, told the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and two other dogs were left on Wednesday late evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson of the Los Angeles Police Department.
"Good news is the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say where exactly the dogs were found in which location, so did not share detailed information about their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard, and David Peek, were not entrusted to comment on the case.
They were very happy when two of their akits were found in a shelter in Downey Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriffs found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, the three-year-old Dog Trace and the 10-month female Didi, were injured, told the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to participate this week in regional competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their discovery was late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs were supposed to compete in other competitions planned days before the AKC/Eukanuba show exhibition, said the Peek journal The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop at almost a month traveling couple after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered to the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a boxer puppy, Parson Russell Terrier and a Bretanian heater - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in a car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They've opened the windows a little, so the dogs have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car robbery at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who's taking them to the missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it wasn't clear whether the prices would be awarded.
Lev is ready to scream again when the MGM restructuring receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of concussions and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so she could start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvent Judge of New York officially blessed the "pre-packed" plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt and clean the way for 86 years old entertainment society, which focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
The quarterly return that the plan meets the requirements of the US competition order does not remain any legal obstacles to re-start the founder Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the heads of the study.
The number of employees drops to about 320 from the originals over 400.
MGM does not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
Now it's a connection to the investment bank that needs $75 million itself and funding is expected around half of December.
The restructuring process started in May 2009, when Moelis & Co was hired by the investment bank to advise the management of how to solve its finances, as management was fighting to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
On August, the President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron, and a turnover expert, known to my work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial problems of MGM and 140 students of the study took a much longer than expected.
Following a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that at the end of 2009 they would be able to sell the company.
Although the auction attracted several candidates, none of them were willing to pay two billion US dollars plus the finances the creditors demanded.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the ripping board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreement, the plan was finally approved by the creditor by the end of October.
When MGM will officially rise from the audition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive many million dollar bonuses for his work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will be paid $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies that collect for their services that run the company, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, called "success Fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to restore production in MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, whose predecessor will be the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
Studio needs a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share of these two films that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM debts, looked at the possibility of merged study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your budget for gifts in balance
This year's candidate is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by the video-here system, but in both cases it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game of Kinect costs just as much as 10 coral shafts or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there's a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy dealers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; this year's technology toys have much more energy at the same prices, if not slightly lower than last years.
While the relatively fewer new toys with associated websites appeared, two of the most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin offers more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increased as well as toys with chargers.
Here are some recommendations.
(All these prices are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are pets that sing when you press their belly.
At one push, the animal will release the tone, and the second press will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Attention: Once you start macking, you can't stop.
The best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, since 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animative doll on Elmo Live technology, who can play Simon Says game, and he also knows a monthly walk through his innovative clothed leg with wheel blocking.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child in the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a bag full of quiz cards, which are designed to change the car ride in entertainment with a self-righteous, funny workbook.
If you're in the smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest variant with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have such an effective lesson as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on SD card that allows you to show family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for children for 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than a matchbox, each of them has a LED display.
The aim is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before the time is up; it's great for competition in improvised forming words.
More toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented at the toys.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include roller skates or Puffle's pet.
A little larger than the puppy of your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children for 5 years), the latest of a number of microrobots on the button battery.
The bug moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun if you make a maze out of the cube and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resistant.
Ours was able to fall down with the kitchen table and spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Implementation of a softer police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked on the square, he strictly controlled his orders and gave orders half-vote with military authority.
He wanted the female members - Chinese static squadrons of urban order, feared and despised for their hard actions and violence - to provide a certain impression on the perpetrators.
Stand straight!
"Come on!"
Show them, she whispers quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted out like the right-hand.
Four head covers fit perfectly on hair that are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"One I think they look average," said Mr. Tang.
"The patterns are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new partners to have higher education.
The Guangdong Province changed grey-green uniforms to allegedly more attractive blue.
In Central China, Wuhan replaced the sealed views for strong armor: in 2009, the report stated that 50 officers were surrounded by an indispensable snack cart with snacks and leaningly looked at the owner until the immersion seller packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, city district with 680 000 people in Chengdu chose surgery for the main image.
Since 2003, the period has added its city police by 13 women, which have been selected specifically according to their appearance, coherence and young age.
The aim is to show, besides the rude side of the police, too, a softer, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have had trouble getting into the secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue the critics for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police are only allowed to enforce a town decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media usually captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province struck an uninvited viewer to death after using his cell phone to film as they began in the procedure in the case of a protest against the dumpster.
Last year, police training in Beijing took place, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, there was a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrator without signs of blood.
This year, a submarine melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five cops and suffered injury to the left part of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the internet shows the Chinese policemen attacking the street seller.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, national edition, screamed last year after further discussion about tactics.
The paper was "really thoroughly cleansed."
Sceptics say that's not enough.
After the district advertised eight new female policemen in October, the editor of the Beijing Evening News dealt with whether women have real duties or are just a distraction.
The answer seems a little bit of both.
The period demanded female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age with a good character and "five face features in the right proportion."
Adepts should be higher than the average - that is, more than 1,6 meters.
The service at 26 is obligatory.
Functionaries say that work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed policeman on Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external quality, which then determines others, include height, weight, face features, etc."
Then there comes a variety of nature and inner quality.
Women are like flowers vases, he said, and he added, "Such as they're vases, they'll also have other responsibility."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the county city, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that the height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like the demand for the symmetrical features of the face.
Which means the question of good expression is the subject of discussion between China.
Certainly disability or irritation is not applicable.
"Can't allow a chrome or humiliated man to serve us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who holds a watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, faces like apple and gently shaped mouth.
She doesn't think that she might have a sexist effect on her appearance, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the city's image."
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just launching traders to the alley where they can do their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers running on foot or bikes and trying to sell as many dumplings and tofu bowls before they are extinct.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu when the marketer started running, and for a time left his wheel with noodles.
Policemen describe their duties as more monotonous than effortless.
"Every day is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studied in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women's policemen have no powers as their male counterparts to confiscate the goods by the sellers.
They can only threaten to report to their male leaders.
The tendency to protect them from sudden public expressions of hostility against the official aparation that are common within the entire China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the main city of Yunnan province, rebelled after the false rumors spread that the police killed the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers have been injured at night; 14 government vehicles have been reversed or burned.
Xinda has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the policemen had that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The police confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop, as required by regulations.
The bike owner could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute distance from the policemen, faced with rabies, with an elbows against the wheelchairs, and quickly off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator attached to the male group, stayed in the back, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like women's police officers, coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in the maintenance and carbonation of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"We sometimes fight physically," said Mr Li.
"Specially, it's the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign's criminal accusation, which involved his affairs with his former campaign counselor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced the Senator's lawyers on the Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican, faced and which was, until the scandal, considered to be a possible Republican candidate for the President for 2012. His affairs had reached national titles and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said it was a decision that followed almost after an annual investigation, "happily pleased."
The Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate's ethical committee.
The lawyers of Mr Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice "we have informed that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of an investigation and that he is not planning to charge any further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who claimed that there were serious evidence that Mr. Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to provide a lucrative lobby which was to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier in Ensign's campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton was employed to be laundered for them, so much documentaries and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently assistant to Mr Ensign, he was excluded from the law of lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Experts in ethics claim that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were before the affair of friends, appeared against the ban on lobbying.
The evidence that was published "has been shown to be a clear case of the preparation of the infringement," said Stanley Brand, the Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are investigated by the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for Senator Ensign's decision, Mr Brand and other Ethics lawyers said that the Ministry was careful in terms of political lawsuits, after a large number of failures, including the last year's decision to suspend the action against former senator Ted Stevens in the middle of the accusation of the doubts of State Prosecution.
The Federal Prosecutors "cleanly hid weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the civilian organization for responsibility and ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), the lawyer's group that filed a number of complaints against Mr Ensign.
"It shows basically that high-risk government officials do not relate to laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign in the interview, told him that the D.A. called him on Monday, and then the next day, he told him that the Ministry did not find any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in the Wednesday statement, "it acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he handed over to the state's attorneys.
"I'm not comfortable to describe the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation by a separate complaint in which the ethical group accused that the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents of 96,000 had violated the federal election law.
The Election Commission stated that she had no evidence to prove that money was nothing but a gift.
One company Mr. Ensign helped Mr Hampton find a lobby work was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr Hampton began to act as a lobbyist, the head of Mr Ensign - John Lopez - communicated with Mr Hampton and told him that he "build" to the Ministry of the Interior on the subject discussed.
Mr. Ensign also took part in lunch with Mr. Hampton and other Nevada client, Allegiant Air and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hire Mr. Hampton to lobby work.
Last year, when the report on the aphere first appeared, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned as the fourth Republican head of the Senate.
After a multi-month stagnation, Mr. Ensign told the reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to attend the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the aim of investigating the crime of his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will be followed quickly by the Ministry of Justice and will complete the investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said.
Challenge of the village of Cheshire turns to Twitter
Half a dozen were written in the courtroom.
One minute after a minute, they sent reports of a terrible witness through Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports were involved in raping and attaching children to beds in the house that was lit.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes was convicted of the killing of three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, family, and had to take place official termination with the imposition of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed appeals with requests and arguments that would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative ones is that the intense reporting of the process - including the extended use of the Twitter of the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this extended, immediate outbreak of information with inflammatory details then introduced the jury in a decision in the sense of affecting the public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to deal with the question of whether new technologies should also require new rules in the courtroom.
"How I've experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that integrating new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair process for individuals," said Mr. Ullmann, the Chief Advocate of Mr. Hayes.
Judge of the process Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State has briefly rejected claims concerning the return of the past week and that the media were "specially controlled" and that there are no evidence that would show that the jury acted under the public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that reporting of notorious cases could raise questions about justice of the process.
In 1966 the United States Supreme Court of Justice, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the media process was "carneval atmosphere".
Some are convinced that this crime was an inspiration of the TV show and the movie "The Shower".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts, which reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later, could be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine how to communicate from the courtrooms, which was in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, law professor Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out at any time.
Professor Donohue said that some judges can be taken into consideration by the idea that the restrictions of immediate communication from the courtrooms can make the process more fair.
The case of Twitter is only one of many of Mr. Hayes' prosecuted lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
For example, the defenders argue that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it may be a predecession when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jurors by showing them crime photographs provoking horror.
Some of the jurors said that they were frightened by the photographs of the victim that Jennifer Hawke-Pet, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenders also claim that they will reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly called the juror who was critical to the nationals and that he misleaded a greater pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury wasn't separated.
But their arguments on the influence of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They argued against the verdict raised last month that the case dominated the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of candidates for the Governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly blowing out the flames of emotions in this case.
"The date of the media, cameras and reporters before the court," wrote a lawyer, "there was something that was not yet to see here in New Haven, and it may also be a national rarith."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more inflammatory than the reports mentioned later and, from their point of view, the judicial police should manage the scope of other processes.
However, some lawyers requested appeal courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court's decisions in the case of Dr. Sheppard's judgment due to the spread of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "The case is Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the gap?
After a campaign that was remarkable about her offence and negativeism, this week in Washington, there was a small amount of politeness.
Is this the first flag of the true cooperation of two political parties or only an illusion moment before a quick return to the party fight in the capital?
The Tuesday negotiations of President Obama and parliamentary leaders have not brought any major discoveries on the essential topics to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a courtesy discussion discussing the differences of two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibility, rather than the other empty particle episode.
The central public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close synergies for several months have built a mutual respect that exceeds the ideological gap that the members are still dividing.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they examine each other's signs of collectiveity and compromise, trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voter patience against the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday negotiations and its subsequent evaluation of the participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the ratios that have been in place for the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after elections.
Elections have caused the emotions of the strings, and then they've gone quiet.
It's good."
In a number of questions, in particular those to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and the Democrats have a small chance to find a solution.
Bush's tax reduction ended at the end of the year and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them on a permanent or temporary basis.
Like the probable compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans cannot see how they support the reduction of property taxes while unemployed refuse unemployment support.
Following the Tuesday negotiations in the White House, more optimism is already seen on possible agreement on these questions, together with the ratification of a new initiating contract.
But William Galston of Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112nd Congress calls to January.
Rather, it is likely that the period of disagreement, or even inevitable, said.
"After things have to be done, psychology will in short perspective return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely extended - to the fact that politeness will lead them to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between current and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely linked to the compilation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters who helped make it.
The Republican leaders now face the danger of exploration, know that they have to act according to their promises and have to reduce government expenses and abolish the new health care law.
These adhesive lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, including the reform of the tax legislation and the increase in certain taxes, the increase in retirement age and the reduction of expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, to raise pressure on the issue of deficit to the public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18th member committee so that they can present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to make the most possible approach to this number.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury who suggest that we have, at least today, little foundations or the will to compromise in the case of financial issues.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first begins next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republicans invite Obama to deal with the budget, taxes and health care to follow the period of greater party cooperation.
What's going to happen?
Public opinion.
There are many evidence that despite the partyity of the last elections, most Americans want to continue to see the two sides that work together.
If it could go to the heel, as it was in 1995, both sides will follow the public’s reactions very carefully.
Whoever threatens to reduce voices, will probably change course and seek compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of the thing.
The Stranicity and directionality are today greater than that in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that the ideological proliferation between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans was more than that in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, an activists on both sides see 2010 as a prerequisite for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the politeness that appeared this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of efforts on both sides to find common grounds on issues that still divide them.
The wrath of the American document indicates Moscow as a refuge of corruption
The city's driving is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues a part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to Kremlin, reported the American Embassy in Russia in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding the protective wings to help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal shops but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - will take his, when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
Records are based on sources whose names have been rediged.
The record was written at the time when Yuri Luzhkov was still Mayor and accused of a great share of corruption.
He was appealed in October by President Dmitry Medvedeveveve, but since then we can only watch minimal changes in cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have been constantly denying corruption charges for many years, and won several charges for cruel charges for such arguing.
In September, he said at the Russian television station when he was asked about the proven testimony of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians with absolute belief believe that if their company is corrupted, it will appear at the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details as such, in the Embassy report, and it is also unaware that they would do so by diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its connection to criminal elements led some to call it "disfunctional," and confirms that the government works more as a cleptocracy than as a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called "cryminal" (the Crimeal and Mafia Term, which literally means "the roof" or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in the Government bureaucracy of Moscow.
"Analytics have identified and a three-stage structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Home Office and Militaries are second degree."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty places in certain areas, because the city does not provide certain services."
The report says FSB takes money from the biggest companies, and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "commerce owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (radio than organised criminal groups), since they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on course."
The record says that while collecting money is complex, protection alone can already be troubled; even those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their shops under different prerequisites are closed.
Medvede spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he made only a little progress.
The Ambassador's report is talking about men taking bags, probably smuggled cash, to Kremlin himself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without dividing power, is inevitable corruption, he said.
Indem estimates that globally costs Russia more than 300 billion dollars a year.
The country ranks at the 154th place in the recent survey on global perception of non-governmental Transparency International organisations (the land is ranked from at least to the most corrupt).
The discovery of the U.S. Embassy report, which appeared in Moscow in late evenings, certainly did not enthusiastic in the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be accused of the Moscow deficiencies, it may be a possibility for Kremlin to argue on the solution of the problem.
During an interview for CNN with Larry King, Putin informed that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeits and responded angryly to the statement that American diplomats called Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is our mutual synergies, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so neethically."
The veteran of the Red Khmers are forced to cope with the past
In a spared concrete textbook with dirty and robbed walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "circuit" for its sustenance during the Red Khmer Government, the commander remains in this distant hold of the Red Khmers in Northwest Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization are still living.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up the government, the long-lasting loyalty is also destroyed in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims in the forum of truth were made possible and reconciliation to confront publicly with the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July bring together the United Nations and Cambodian Court the first conviction of the former Red Khmer member, the judgment of the former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, 35 years of imprisonment.
With each such progress, he grew restless among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts of reconciliation and their attempts to join the Cambodian society again.
"The former Red Khmers are a grudge and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life was beautiful between the Red Khmers, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates the families."
During the Red Khmer Government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, sickness or recast.
When the Vietnamese attacked and rejected the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and his soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started uprising, which lasted until the last move in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were running partisans wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in Western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated uprising in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The great groups of Red Khmer fighters began to go to the government that raised the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 during waiting for a trial.
Their successors have no longer taken care of them, most of the former Red Khmer Warriors have fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgicly remembers the movement time.
Although several elite Red Khmers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people had only a minimum benefit from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads the public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopical aggressive ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"The life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"The Mok's enjoyed them all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to secure everything ourselves."
The ongoing Red Khmer Court also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will start investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of Red Khmers.
The court has the mandate to prosecute the presidency and the persons responsible for crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was just a little to calm down the fears of Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations focused on Im Chaema, 64, which was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Khmer Government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she had been supervising the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project likely to be killed by thousands of forced workers.
The last night Im Chaem came back from work in her wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and the shadows appeared over the dusty grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past between the Red Khmers.
If the court summons her, she'd refuse to go.
"He has peace in Cambodia and is stable," she said.
"If there are other criminal prosecutions, there will be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who crossed from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court would seek another suspect, although experts and historians disagree with it.
"The Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do for moving forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Community in the Khmer ratios means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre issued the first textbook approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, has 75 pages and the title "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that the new textbook helped students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents responded sceptically when he took home a book for study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are going to be prosecuted."
Such opposition makes the process of reconciliation more complex and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, the textbooks, and the court starts having influence, said further.
The Red Khmers still have a powerful spell here.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is the road grown with weed and scattered with thrown plastic bags that leads to rectangles from black belts covered by a residual sheet roof.
The body of Pol Pota was burned here on a bunch of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, cell phone salesman on the edge of the road said she doesn't know much about the man who was cremated in that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pota's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of mature bananas in hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to be its weapons on the basis of uranium
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign regarding the provision of nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would give up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the Security Summit by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has tried to convince Belarus to give up a highly enriched uranium, and it seems that the stone of injury has been hit last spring.
But American officials said The Washington Post that in the last two months a few classified operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared land for the medieval agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement turned out to be one of the most important results of the Obam's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, where Belarus was eliminated.
And apparently, it was a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, the Nuclear Safety Group.
Clinton called the agreement as a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world within four years.
Since then, the American government has helped six countries to get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seven.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obam's Summit on Nuclear Security, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up his uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the base for weapons and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States a few months ago and showed interest in reaching the agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, because the material was lightly irradiated, the officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train traveling more than 1,300 miles into a Russian storage and liquidation facility, said officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday, and it was made by air, said the officials.
The American government spent 13 million dollars on the programme, most of it to deliver a less enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Beniawski, the official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable to the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relationships between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, especially because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But the medieval statement indicates the possibility of graduation.
"We welcome progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government didn't deal with CIA dragon flights
The Spanish government did not do expensive flights regarding CIA flights transporting trapped Taliban and members of Al-Qaida to Guantanam through the Spanish territory, as expressed in his telegram by the United States messenger in Madrid.
This follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks Log El País, where it is also written that the former first Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vegová asked for the Spanish execuation to be informed and "he could show that he had adequate supervision of foreign flights flying through the Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, in which it was accused of dozens of States including Spain from the participation in human rights violations, a meeting between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vegova took place.
The Prime Minister said that the Communication of the Council of Europe "revoked from the game of Zapater's government" insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegová pointed out that Spain had no problem with the flights of secret services across its territory.
"One people just want to be informed" so that they are not "restricted unprepared," says Aguirre in one of the documents.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos also suggested to the American Ambassador that the Spanish government "was to give this matter as low as possible, but by the fact that the case was in the hands of judges, it had a limited ability to influence."
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as it is concerned, he does not intend to block the initiative of the judge to request the secretion of the documents of the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning the CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated component or sensitive information", explained the Embassy after interviewing the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns rather because of the obvious coordination between the Spanish Judge and the German Prosecutors" rather than for the disclosure of CNI information or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to tackle this case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, at the occasion of the lunch of Ambassadors of the United States and Minister of Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the Ambassadors that "Even though Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they will consider appropriate", he has already given instructions to his co-workers, "whether they avoided angry comments with the intention of reducing the tension."
The Ambassador also expresses its concerns about Partido Popular political parties (PP; Czech People's Party - notably) in this matter.
"In spite of its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that Zapater's government has tolerated or intentionally ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if this discovery could have negative consequences for the United States Government," he notes.
Admitted mother-killer complained on the mother's "defense" network.
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog: "Teror in Galicia"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the internet.
With this nickname she used for a while, she communicated with her cousin and at least once a friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruňa, from which a young woman originates.
Reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know a woman's emotional life, which ABC's journal reconstructs with the help of testimony of her family members.
In 1998, a 30-year-old woman from Galicia joined the industrialist Ivan Túnez.
They dated one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if his newborn child was, but his ex-girlfriend never let her do DNA tests.
Soon she found a new friend.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from near Lousam.
Their conviction took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearian Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner who even came to Palma for a week.
However, the content of its communication is apparent that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's alone at the Menorca, and she says, "Alberto's some kind of annoyed that I left for work."
"When I told him, he seemed good, but now he realizes he had to be with a small day and can't do what he wanted."
Then he's talking about the text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send you a child."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave a baby with my mother, I'll take him when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to my place: "I'm going to go this week, but I'm only staying until 19, because I have to go to work to lose the place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to himself.
"She'll be with who he's supposed to be with, with me, and he's never gonna happen again in my life that I'll leave him with someone other than my mother," a doubtful intent in relation to her bad relationships.
In July there is another allowance.
When it draws this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month and was probably murdered by 10 is already dead.
"César is happy on one side, but on the other hand, he's not."
"On the one hand he's with me, and he likes it here, but on the other hand he's going to school almost every day."
They're talking about moving to Mallorc.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'll save some money for the babysitter."
Seventeen greetings and complaints.
"The big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what video he wants to email you, see how he wants to meet me, sex needs."
The 30th next report: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report on Víctor, the current partner, "He's giving me money."
On the Internet there are Munich's contributions on the blocks dedicated to anime and mansion.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revided, where she had to call herself "Muki ex-con. "
"Teror in Galicia (motto)."
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses his pity and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial cassette yesterday in Palma, where she came from the prison center in Menorka.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "that she had no intention of hurting a little."
She admitted earlier that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
The prosecutor and prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric examination.
Humans would have won 4 chairs and PSCs (Socialist Party of Catalonia - noted) would lose 9 mandates.
with the results dated 28 November, PP could have the main word at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the votes received and the number of experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Life Party of Catalonia) already has the idea of general elections, whether or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in national elections is usually one of those against the Catalan elections.
In 2008, Catalan people received 610.473 votes in general, while in 2006 autonomous elections this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, she received a PPC (the People's Party of Catalonia) 384.091 vote.
If this tendency is maintained, the PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House compared to the existing 8, the CiU Party (Convergencia and Unió, Czech Shoda and the Union) also acquire 4 mandates (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia has a key significance for PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Party).
According to this analysis, the People's Party of the ERC (Levi Republican Republic of Catalonia) would have lost one member - now has 3 - while the ICV (the Green Initiative for Catalan) would continue to have one mandate, or another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest appointment will take place in May 2011 at the occasion of the general elections, where the people might also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist domination in the four main province cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the most anticipated budgetary administrations - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both nationalists and humans agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the city hall in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, ERC and ICV parties.
In view of the debacling of the Republicans, it would not be impossible if this party had lost its representation in the Barcelona Representation - since at least 5% of the votes should be obtained.
The PP side increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragon.
The Nacionalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turning in Tarragon, where they ruled together the PP side before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesterose.
In Lérida only received PP by 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy during the last campaign, they met in several occasions.
Humans also won at other important councillors such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
At present, the PP is represented at 34 councillors in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan Cell has provided Al-Qaida with thousands of passports
Apart from the seven detained in Barcelona, another three were arrested in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and one Nigerian detained agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona were a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which arranged passports to various groups of Al-Qaida organisations, among which "Tygrys of the Exemption of the Violian Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second appointed group was the author of the bombs in Bombay, which died 106 persons in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to this issue, aims to ensure that the counterfeiting Al-Qaida Aparate is weakened by the "operation of Kampai" at an international level and to "measure its operational capacities".
Investigators estimate that this cell could have been active in two years in Catalan to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then counterfeited and then delivered to groups forming a criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaida organization, so that their "fighters" can travel unrestly across the borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active network of Jihad in Europe, and therefore, these investigations were also involved in other European police forces, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that in the next days, there will not be similar interventions in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another in Thailand in which they were captured by Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thaiec Sirikanlaya Kibumrung.
They were just those men who drove a Bangkok cell located in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Katalánian network, whose part was destroyed in 2009, stolen in particular to tourists passports that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men from 25 to 45 years of age, had to be valid for a few years and be free of designated visas.
In the investigation documents it is stressed that there are no facts that would be known yet to link the detained from Catalan with the assassination in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalan to the transfer agency by about a thousand dollars that were "included" to buy cards into mobile phones, which later were used by members of the "committee" that killed 106 people.
The police have confiscated a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Maso to stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (Life Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity to personally present to Artur Maso its conditions under which he is willing to support his entry into the position of President Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and renouncement of risky businesses such as an economic agreement, which the leader of the nationalists wants to propose during their mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's People's Meeting with Arture Maso with a certainty of 18 MEPs received in the elections of last Sunday, which is more than satisfying for the popularity, so the CiU candidate needs to abstain at least one of the formations forming the opposition to vote for its commitment to the Office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliance that Nacionalists in the House would like to maintain when general elections are held, but so far, the talks that lead the Mas with the rest of political leaders are held in the Catalan spirit.
As far as President PP is concerned, to get her support for putting in office, "it will have to end with all the sovereign and liberative speeches", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to the one from Basque - about which the leader of CiU even wanted to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to snap a great political aparate of autonomous administrations and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations on Masova entry into the function will be addressed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
The Mas has already met Joaquin Still (PSC), who promised a hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will meet today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The manager of the geriatric facility ensures that there was no death as a result of the "deadness of the measure"
The presentation of the Olot Centre does not exclude that their caretaker killed more than 11 clients
The headquarters of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to address the damage caused by the institution of Joana Vily Dilmé's criminal behavior, a caretaker who, while being employed here, killed at least eleven seniors that he had in custody.
The director of this home for the senior Joan Sala came in escorts with the law lawyer of the facility, Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty" responsible for killing, but "the law and responsibility are obliging us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not revealed the criminal activities of the caretaker in time, the great threat to the home of La Caritat presents the demands for material compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the remaining.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had happened in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since then
The judge ordered an exhumation of eight bodies of home-home clients, suspecting that in many cases he did not look at the dead any doctor personally, but that - given the age and the bad condition of patients - everything was done on the phone.
La Caritat, by means of her director, resolutely refused this edge and pointed out that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
Law attorney La Caritat added that "in the case there is no indication that any third party would have made doubts besides his own accused."
A man now suspected "Anděl of Death" admitted yesterday 11 deaths and stated that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later killed the other old man.
in this case, death caused too high insulin doses, unlike the first case when it was used a mixture of comforting tablets.
Director La Caritat pointed out that it was complicated to control personnel's access to medicine.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases by means of nine people using this caretaker to kill patients in their efforts to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now in the lab should show whether Villa is lying and actually looking for less cruel death for his first victims, or killed them by giving the louh, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims and do not exclude that the number of killed may be higher than he admitted to, and justify his behavior in various versions, which Vila gave to the court knowing that he had to change his actions when it came out that he had killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be justice available to be explained the whole scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of President of the European Central Bank of Trichet, who pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
The regional differentials have been closed by force and the shares of the European Bank have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to mislead - the euro has now risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, although there is a decline, recovers - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
The investor's gonna take a while to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal fourthly in two years.
The Bank requested the termination of the State debt plan for the ineffectiveness and elimination of all exceptional liquidity rates within the time limit and for the remainder of unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to predict "minimum by March" and to receive a three-month licence with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If the expectations are not created, it will re-react the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw liquidity rates, God will be with us!
It was the same at the convention in May where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets - there could be a recurrence of history tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and durable.
In May, the panther fist announced it on Monday, and on Wednesday, she said that she had already purchased many of them, thereby causing further collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the exchange rate was very poor for one year in Portugal.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of previous auctions.
Therefore, the rates in Portugal have declined by 30 points below, reflecting the changes in the mood of the market, which occurred after Trichet.
In Ireland the numbers were published representing the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts represent around 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000, they have the chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be stabbed.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem has not revealed stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable within the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to obtain approval by the new budget by Parliament and still has no sufficient support, so in Ireland there is still uncertainty.
Angela Merkel mitigated the tone of her speech to release the tension in the face for the next meeting of the EU spies held on 14 December, on which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is, Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would rather be Beethoven's Odu for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action that will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - it sounds like the four annual period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5%, i.e. twice than other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the government's reaction and the Spanish national banks were quick and convincing - we seem to have suffered from the effect of surprises.
Today, we have a key bond license for three years, which will be favoured by the effect of Trichet, for which we hope for it will be a great demand that will help to distribute doubts about our refinancing capabilities.
Requesting a rescue plan would be self-defense for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there is 40.000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and the market access would be closed by the sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the Cesar woman's strategy - "not to be, but it seems."
We can do it.
President of the Eulen Group attacks Vega Sicilia’s meetings required by his children
The storm in an open conflict in the Alvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not silent.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, attacks after he considered it "very irrelevant", the legal act of El Enebro planned for the 16th of this month and the required five of his seven descendants, on which they should attempt to force their majority and to reign with the administrations of the Prosecutor Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are in charge of a legal group for the new chapter of their dispute to control part of the company.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to be willing to disagree in his dispute on membership in the El Enebro Group's government authorities.
of its Administrative Committee, five of its seven descendants, who were appointed forefactors during the assembly of shareholders on 18 January this year and whose objection was entered in the Commercial Register.
El Enebro's proceedings planned for the 16th of this month, which was convened by the official of the Trade Court number 2 in Madrid, renewed the mud in the womb of the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means to guarantee the union of the Commission until the dispute is resolved.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pabla, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of Álvarez's Mezquiriz considers David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving through court ruthlessness and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve negotiations of 18 January, which was completely invalid."
This argument will serve as a basis for justification of the legal assault of this act as a "very meaningless".
The protagonists themselves who discreetly remain silent have already tried without success to summon the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned next to other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder requires 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key question that the judge will have to decide when he refers to the question of a court attack. The date of this reconciliation has not yet been established.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
The software proposes improvement in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull entered Formula 1 series in 2004, his history in this exceptional world of speed is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new incoming team, and despite the upcoming tendencies of the recent times, they all put on the Ferrari Fernanda Alons triumph.
Without decreasing the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formule 1, the legend was born - the secret weapon that the multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches which the German company put on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote automotive sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design mounting lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to reproduce the product faithfully or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous used vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this software device enabled Red Bull to perform "on a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements which are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, they were employing stables on average 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four perfections during one period.
in the Red Bull team today works on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with efficient information technology that analyze and propose any type of modification of racing vehicles.
The manager of Siemens explained that PLM is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period in order to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set up approximately 50 km from London the race of top technologies for design and production of its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are limited to visits - especially to journalists.
All that's happening here is considered a "big secret."
The list of 580 participants, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Hero Red Bull is in Formula 1 without a doubt a fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, other protagonists, whose aid is invaluable and no one knows them, are hiding behind the immeasurable technology that the energy beverage brand has put into its participation in the racing circuits.
Steve Nevey's head of production technology claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in vehicle research and development has contributed to a victory of 50% and the rest was a merit of riders.
at present this ratio has changed and technology is worth a success of 85% while pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing techniques because they are "unforeseeable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in cooperation with local distributors over two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the network of 20 trades in the area of 80 to 100 m2, which this transnational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be placed in 16 already existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of the Spanish HP Helena Herrer presented an example of a newly rebuilt store on Barcelona's Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has set up a plan to set up 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish trades.
The first shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Rumunia) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the third shop in Barcelona.
Herrer didn't want to tell where other shops would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP personal systems, ensured that the philosophy of opening shops will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
Severoamerican company here advises with exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
Furthermore, HP also deals with the provision of staff for business.
Helena Herrer said that it would be franchising, and stressed that the exclusive sales network aimed at "to improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in shopping, service, post-sales service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the world-level pilot pioneering programme aimed at addressing any problems with computer instruments in guarantee.
The online service is connected with the technical centre located in Maastricht (Nizozemí).
"We'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes, which may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for common customers, given that large companies already have contractual technical assistance", emphasised yesterday Helena Herrerová.
Sabadell's betting that he's stealing a million clients in three years to his competitors
Optimistic than other bosses, a delegated member of the Banco Sabadell Council, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but reject the new liquidity crisis and predict the end of the passive war.
However, it is calculated by a reduction in interest rates, which, however, will try to compensate for the reduction of bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to be able to get a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to the survival without the need to turn to public aid in the FROB, to obtain a market share by captureing a million new private clients - respecting 700.000, if those who, if appropriate, leave the bank - since until now, and the institution rather moved small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 200,000 private clients and 50,000 companies.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it can also be said sobriety, with a view to reducing the costs of which the challenge will show the bank when presenting the results for the period.
At this time, a few banking institutions dare to set their goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the world banking plans.
Sabadell will close his Optima programme this year, set up four years ago, although originally it was for three years, but the market situation required an extension for another period.
Clients who leave the savings will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
He believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be long."
In addition, in two or three years, "bare difficult to create employment", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, added.
And although he believes that a passive war - which reduces the margin - defers, the price of the burden on the risk that banks and savings pay for their emissions to receive liquidity, it is already shifting to the credit prices, compensating for the reduction of margins.
"The climate of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a pressure factor for loans".
"We haven't closed the cock yet, but the differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase the prices of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also recognised that the tendencies in banking "now is a reduction in commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
The strategy plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not free of charge to ensure that in Spain "they will require more size."
"The next year he won't stay on a stone," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "goodly reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter the red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can complement the collection of funds in the market before the new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it continues to be a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term financing by means of repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of the savings merger
CECA’s Director General refused yesterday that another wave of the savings merger should be created and again insisted on the speed with which the sector’s reorganisation is being reorganized.
When the Spanish savings process started, there were several institutions that assured that the first phase would not take part and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled out that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, Cajasol incorporation to the Banca Cywica Group cannot be regarded as the second round, what is happening is the Conventions."
"The majority is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well in this matter," said the Director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of leading and executive officials of Aragon - he failed.) Olavarrieta said that the process of concentration was carried out at "the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied as shown in the repayments that were not now appeared in the business plans with Spain's national bank", stressed.
"Get out of 45 savings with an average asset of 28,000 million to 17, with 75,500 million is a process that does not compare in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are larger and thus falling in accordance with the Basilian Treaty."
Olavarrieta recognised that "a number of unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is reminding us that we have to be in a deadline before the end of the year".
CECA CECA CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta last night assured Spain had the most strict financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and those who questioned it, he sentenced "a lack of knowledge".
The Director pointed out that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and the savings and the system that managed the "very important" concentration process and which continues "the highest possible speed".
He also pointed out that Spanish banking was very well out of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro but has laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
The tension in the markets has provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from the reduction of taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediaries or the abolition of EUR 426 for unemployed, up to 49% of AENA (Spain airports and air traffic management), the manager of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad with the support of former Prime Minister Felipa González, on the other hand, joined the critics at Chancellor Angela Merkel's address for her responsibility to start the current crisis.
How to interpret this move?
Let me say in advance that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of the euro redeployment.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what his future should be, which reflects the idea of respect for the old traditions, which a large part of the other members hold.
Faced in the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible roads from the crisis.
The first represents a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern countries would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the return to the Marca - although it can now appear as scifi, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German proposals for recasting the euro with a greater macroeconomic oversight, budgetary strictness, fines for guilty states, possible deferrals for some of them, and with an extension of possible regulatory costs for the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a while, so there is no space for the vertigo now.
Firstly, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German Government drew out a constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (Fiscal Structure and Stability Plans) and the practice of its European partners, including France.
The second showed this Central European country when Merkel had painfully stretched her decision on salvation of Greece.
It was already the subject of a sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, was strongly against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in recent October days Merkel again appeared with a clear opinion when she demanded to reform the European Union Conventions in order to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time to have private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because the Irish crisis and everything else accelerated.
However, its proposal, although in a slightly mitigated form, has been approved, and in the next months we should monitor the Union reform process that should enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has set a red line that he will not cross.
And he tells all of us that, although it is now necessary to take measures that seem to be too disagreeable, from this date, the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of the new monetary zone in which the infringements of the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare defer payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we need to take a strict path to growth with an increase in savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another possibility based on claims and construction, with tremendous gaps in the balance of payments, which was ruled in the years of the boom of Spain's growth, would simply not tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not only a 3% renewal of public deficit in 2013.
What they want is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we could be mistaken ourselves.
I hope these current turbulences improve peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statements (reforms promised after meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's notification of new measures) suggests that through critics at Merkel's address, the idea has opened the way of making things right.
However, the red line that Germany has identified is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And from the options that can be considered, leaving the euro area full of unsecured countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that he warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
Finty, which they have demonstrated by Alonso and Ramos in the fight with Ajax, show the idea not to escape the punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alons and Sergia Ramose) in the fight of the League of Masters against Ajax of 23 November caused that the sea ink was written about whether this is or not unsportable behaviour and whether both football players should be punished by the EUFA.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly won) the appointed players one after another intentionally lost time when the faul was to be played to provoke the barrel, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfill the prescribed punishment in the next match against Auxerre - while Real Madrid ends in its group head - and will be able, rid of cards, continue to the next stage.
Finally, she granted the EUFA disciplinary commission to coach José Mourinho's punishment for two matches and the guilty players received a cash penalty.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but it is more or less common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the étos football, i.e. the rules that are not written, but they follow.
The part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the Real Madrid team was participant (which boasts the nobleness and honor in his hymn, and which has already been punished by its players for the similar acts), and as it seems, also thanks to the drama of the led Mourinh, which thus adds to its long history of the comedian and provocator another episode.
in any case, the debate is about whether this type of action, which is not explicitly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a circumvention in these activities; it is indeed an action respecting sporting rules, which, of course, seems to be trying to circumvent.
There is a solution to what kind of damage such a act is made by a sports spirit.
One of the importance of sports behavior is the physical incapacity of players who have not been infringed in these cases, or the violent game has not occurred.
Another of these features characterizing a clean game is to avoid players having advantages against the opponent team - which did not happen here either.
So paradoxic at the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as lest or circumventing the law has not occurred to a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty.
They waited and liked to get punished.
But the next question is, what advantage will the blamers of their deliberate violation have.
Here it is necessary to note that the opponent does not reach a disadvantaged position, and that in the current match there is no benefit, because the evident consequence is that the team itself will have less players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for another game, because the club will not be able to count on these players.
Clearly, the advantage is that players start another stage of the League of Masters without cards that might jeopardise their participation in the future match.
However, this is the advantage of the long-term perspective and with a certain degree of indefinitely, so at first sight the team can be eliminated, and, besides, the players will renew the penalty, and they will go to the second round of cards in which one card is enough to exclude by less than in the first round.
So if the wheels continue, it won't be quite clear whether it's an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the sports spirit, which is part of which is to take strategic decisions, which will make maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case of which we are dealing here, there were no players aimed at avoiding the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but they chose to be subjected to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or avoiding punishment.
Although the border between the oscillation and circumventing the rules is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a matter of concern.
It seems to me that the field is due to two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions, and because of the way the transfer of instructions was made to provoke them from the leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting Offers for organizing Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictate concentrates the avalanche bookings this year on December 16th and 17th.
There are celebrations paid by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros quickly.
Like the Turkish honey or lottery, the coming of December comes again the pre-wave parties that still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and facilities for leisures in Barcelona, but the crisis has resulted in the fight against customers with price reductions: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, they agree with the business and associations from this sector.
In order to complete the complications of the accounts, he concentrated the calendar this year (when the Christmas Day fell on Friday) of the request for a week from 13 December, there was an avalanche of bookings for days in the hospital (16. and 17.), while almost no operation was in the previous week.
As it has been since 2008, when the weighty years have started, many companies have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave the tradition, many employees pay their own pocket parties' expenses.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the level of abundance, the President of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The patronage of restaurant facilities is now not daring to predict what the celebrations will be like this month.
"People will think well before they make reservations."
"They want to go out, but as far as prices are concerned, they're careful", he adds.
Shops will go well to those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", he says and reminds us that customers tend to go downwards thanks to the crisis and most customers want to spend about 25 euros now.
The survey in various facilities shows that the biggest support for reservation applications is for the evening of December 17th.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom of reservations for this Friday, with the most demands for loss up to EUR 30, which adapted the offered menus whose total prices are between 25 and 30 euros.
in another significant company, which is Andilana, which counts 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the speciality of this year calendar more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible even to keep the prices from last year, and our menus, each of which should choose, are going from 19.95 to 30 euros", says.
In the AN Group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen the increase in profits since the second half and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas trades.
The sources of this company stress that also, December 18th will be a busy day, as there will be demonstration celebrations between friends.
to their six group menus added a Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded in comparison with last year the tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spain smuggling wine - noted.).
They also noted that companies that are once again invited by their employees appearing to be a little larger than that, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
The vice-president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Free Time Center in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he starts to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has been "lived", although clients "contract to the maximum".
This impression, even during Christmas celebrations, did not resurrect, pointing out who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme caused great restlessness in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a faster pace than any other country.
Wikileaks documents confirm the ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary negligence that in Washington stimulates Pakistani nuclear programme.
In addition to the clarification and significant details that they offer regarding the content of communication and the idea of representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two States as regards nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "is at retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The speciality of the Pakistani nuclear program - that his weapons are not assembled, but they are stored after parts to make it easier for them to be destroyed in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the vibe of Washington.
This calculates the ambassador in Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before visiting the National Security Advisor James Jones: "Accommodation of certain nuclear equipment against the territory under the control of the Taliban, alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenales and the controlled missile programme is no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and representing reason to be alert.
"The Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the collapse of education and culture levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes of controlled missiles", said the expert Jurij Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the meeting with their counterparties from the USA.
The biggest new documentation published by the Julian Assange server is increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear weapons spread and increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Depees issued by the Embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", argues: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain without response or are rejected".
In the next report Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence worker for South Asia, states that "and through the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to, during the visit of the chief of the army of General Ashfaq Kayani, "very well clarified" that the "pakistan army must end with silent support for terrorist groups".
Hon for Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a highly built worker responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leakages.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track down and determine where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday the "missible challenge", so-called red notice, "localizing and tracking of movement" Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dated November 20th.
And he has nothing to do with the final escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with sexual abuse charges that Australan faces in Sweden.
In addition, he assures the lawyer who created Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "policie knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang."
It was November 20, when the international police congregation, established in France Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, however, did not publish it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries of Interpol have guidelines for identifying or localising Assange "to put temporary bonds on it and to issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned with a red call, many Member States, as explained by the organization, consider the so-called red notice as to allow arrest to be made - this must be ensured by a national police component - especially if the two-sided state has a detention agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange should be found.
This step has worsened Assenge's lawyers who have published yesterday writing where they declare that the nine-year-old founder Wikileaks has shown willingness to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities using a videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Berija, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal persecution," says a letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, Skype provided an interview with the Chief Editor Time magazine - in this interview requested demise from the United States Minister of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out to be responsible for the order of the US diplomats to conduct spying in the UN and to violate the international conventions that the United States have signed, she should resign", he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs, who qualified the requirement of demiss as "scratical and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual that operates the website," he declared for the CNN.
Obama himself entrusted a highly built worker responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Traverse to prevent further leakages of documents.
The objection of President Barack Obama to stop adding Assang on the importance contrasts with the opinions that these days conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chaired by the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks between the terrorist organization, "to be able to intervene and pursue anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance".
Tom Flanagan, a consultant of the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should "be killed", which he had to cancel.
"Obama should write a reward on him or use an unmanned plane or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, the baptist priest, the former governor of Arkansas and the possible candidate for the president.
"Everyone in the government, whoever is responsible for leaking the information, has committed treason and any other punishment than execution would be too mild," said at the station Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC "smoking" on the Caroda parcel
The Republican leader will allow a secret vote on its persistence.
Huguet suggests more plural exekution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós probably found a recipe to fight with several inner revolutions in the series of ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - noticed), without consequent effect due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding demiss seems to be the adversaries of the former leader Josep Lluíse Caroda-Rovira insufficient, and he also knows that the impact of this sector is already as weak as his leader himself, and that he can absolutely not give him such concerns as he had with other dissolved currents.
That's why Levice's leader will try to get new critics by using blinking that will help him to defend himself in the general elections.
First of all, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to secretly speak to his continued office.
By using the voters, not by lifting your hand.
If the advocates of Caroda want to hand over a criminal vote to the chair, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the breakdown and deceive his person.
in several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage that it would also not be a good result of "after Bulgarian".
The followers of Caroda demand more than to give his function available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercós is the largest authority in the conventions.
But since they don't have a sufficient majority to force the demos, they'll try to reminisce the plan from now until May.
They are therefore expecting to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document on which the leadership will be given to vote on the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this congress will be relocated in autumn 2011.
The leader of the ERC has declared that "multifiedness" damages stability, and that its aim is to once and for all, the organization is able to wipe its dirty underwear behind closed doors.
in this context, it seems a remarkable article that the current consultant Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking Puigcercós' ideologist into consideration, he took this innovation counselor for a finished thing that the leader would be confirmed by the "change for several objectives".
And he named five, two of which are perfect.
The first is "compromising" in order to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces that are from the Carod sector.
The second target can be great news.
The Huguet proposes that the ERC should complete its meeting as a functioning mechanism.
It therefore fights for the reform of the statutes so that the congresses can be held through delegates selected by voting.
Ending with the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended objective of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought at the last two conventions in this direction.
However, the fragile 2008 Assembly decided that the meeting had to be assessed at the Special Congress on the Reforms of the Statute.
This matter is still unfinished, as the situation within the party has been discouraged by the solution to this matter.
Now, without sensitive critical sectors, it could be a good time to reconsider this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for November; 390 for 2010
According to the MILENIO's journal, Mexico had a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than the previous month, as MILENIO said.
There are three murders and a few separate bodies found in the Mexico Valley.
In the last month of the year they read a total of 390 killings in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases there is a found body in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, County Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a further wound from grace to the head and had hands and legs tied with the rope.
The next day the body was found in the trunk that was stored in the luggage area of the vehicle above the street of Mixtecas, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, in the county Naucalpan.
Soon on Thursday 4th November, cooperatives discovered a body carrying signs of torture and at least three fatal bullets in the chest at Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the section of the Villa Guerrero district.
A report was signed by La Familia Michoacan next to the body.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight shots after he got out of his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec district.
in Chalco, on a remote road in El Naranjo colony, the body of the man shot in the forehead, and under the body was found bullets from the gun of the calibre 25.
in Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the wastewater channel in the Playa Golondrina colony.
Rescue files have carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but they didn't find them.
The Tepotzotlan residents reported the finding of the body with hands tied to the back and smashed head on the spot of Pena Colorada.
A man had a shotgun wound to the adhesive.
In the mid-month, the murder of two men who were packed in the laundry and left in the luggage area of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza, was also reported in the victim's death threat report.
A day later, she was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz carton box, which contained the human head.
in the nearest colony was found the rest of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
Two dead women were found packed into a laundry in the village of Zoquiapan in the county of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the murdered man was found wrapped in a yellow-grown sheet, which was presumed by the report that the killer left at his body, identified as Mario Ríos.
in Ixtapaluca in San Francisco Acuautla, a woman was found without signs of life with two wounds into a drift.
On the skin of the woman, the tattoo of the sacred character of Santa Muerte ( literally "Sacred Death" was discovered) and also the necklaces with its similarity.
At the end of the month, a man's corpse was found in Zinacantepec's car with at least three shots and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with their head belt, and there was also a message in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations in which it said, "This is what happens to those who don't adapt."
two bodies were found in Ecatepec, which carried signs of torture and bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi at the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month were found remains of two men in Los Reyes La Paz and Unhualcóotl.
The first of them was stabbed and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied up with a tape and had an impure message with him; while the other was tortured and found in a plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juarez.
Together, the agents and the report have been found.
China adheres to its goal to reduce greenhouse gases
This country's representative at the UN climate change conference COP16 has ensured that its country has developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprint and has clarified that it insists on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public performance at the 16th Conference of the Contracting Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Su Wei ensured that its country has developed a huge effort to reduce carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has invested 245 million dollars in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the past four years.
However, he saw that China would not change its goals and continue working on this matter with the international community.
He argued that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and pilot programmes support.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
He also stressed that the federal authorities cooperated in China coordinated with the province and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, as he has communicated, various several years of plans have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is, as he said, a programme for the efficient use of energy that has been implemented over the last five years and has received investments from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial project for climate change is also running, the project for the exchange of lights for austerity lamps and the project for mitigation and adaptation, has specified.
At the same table Martin Krol assured the country’s expert counselor for climate change that China’s efforts were greater than the general thought.
For example, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased by 20% energy efficiency over the past five years and expects further progress by 2020.
Dismissed Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - noted) said that the former chairman of the party is entitled to request his rights with the National Order Commission.
The National Chairman of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientosa has been terminated and that the former chairman of this Party is entitled to contact the National Order Commission and to request its rights.
in the interview, which was taken before the opposition by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, said that the exclusion of Espina is in any event a decision taken at the local level.
"It's about the autonomous decision of the Constitutional Commission in Sonor."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint on the National Board of Supervisors in order to act as a decision made by the competent authority", he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that it was never at the negotiating table on the chairmanship of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN would come from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his follower will be elected, strengthened.
"This (aliance in 2012) is a topic which has never been at the negotiating table, at least not so far, it was an intention for local elections, which was successful and accomplished its purpose", said.
Prime Minister PAN said that 71 years of dialogue is behind it, and therefore, "you do not care for inner competition, on the contrary, we're making it harder and strengthening us", he added.
He said that the committee could choose the best chairman or chairman PAN deserves for the next three years, so he'll hand over the staff of the "who will determine the committee".
"I am absolutely calm and relaxed, so I will hand over to any of those five with pride to the Chairman of the Party."
He foretold that the rise that the party recorded in the last July elections will be reflected in future destinies, although "it is not still time to think for 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany the governor Gabina Cué in this task."
in this context, he stressed that these three governments, having roots in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be subject to observation throughout the country, because "they are put into them many expectations and desires, and I am sure that Gabino will meet these expectations."
When we asked him about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón on the side of PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech Revolution Institutional Party, notably) because of his speeches within the four years he dominated, César Nava invited members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of former Presidents Ernesta Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If they believe in PRI that the Zedilla and Salinase governments were better than the rulers of Fox and Claderón, let them be defended, let them come out of their alley," he testified.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during the speech in the National Audit, since there is no use of gauge or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and insist that they approve this law", the American president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today contributed to his personal social network account Twitter joined the national mobilisation to support the Dream Act, which should legalise students without documents.
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and insist that they approve this law," tweeted Obama.
Its short report draws attention to the Internet link to a more comprehensive document which calls for the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"If it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now has come the moment to let your opinion come," points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened by blocking the approval of any law unless an extension of the Bush tax reduction and government funding has been approved.
Such blocking, which was notified by letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new agreement with Russia against nuclear weapons spread, called START.
When he was asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the president spokesperson expressed that he believed that once the fiscal topic was resolved, it would be possible to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe that there is plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach an agreement on this matter at some point, and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Chamber Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote for the conclusion of the debate" concerning the Dream Act, so that a proposal for the legalisation of students without evidence could be voted in the Chamber from next Thursday, although it is more likely to be next week.
Senatorial approval of Dream Act, or the law of "American Dream" would legalise about 800,000 young people who got into the United States before the 16 years have been completed, remained in the country over the last five years and have been admitted to a higher education institution or military institution.
However, the supporters need 60 votes to be approved, so they need help from several Republicans, so that the organizations of its supporters carry out intense agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats, whose majority of Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebrasky, expressed its vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, consistents of the Dream Act need to obtain several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican Senators with whom the most advocates negotiate are senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the departing Senator from Florida George Lemieux, who supplemented the mandate of Senator Mela Martínez.
The other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they said they wouldn't support it again.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives attaches to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature insert the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en lallaga", translated "buck your finger into the wound" is the likeness of the Czech "develop the nails on the head - noted.)
The second round of the cycle The comfort of the language was promenade, where participants demonstrated the literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... the finger to the wound? What is it waiting for me?", was the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round The pleasure of the language, the cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a header (in another fair they devoted to the topic of Sex in the language at the round table, explained).
The finger was put into the wound "in close" by a lazy Argentine writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the round table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayra Monterová and Luise Garcíi Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she dedicated to Gonzalu Celorio, and which Schultz then referred to as a great story in which Luisa performed in the first person as a protagonist who, when searching for the knowledge of the "in the morning" goes from a doctor to a doctor from whom she was not answered, although the trace of the same story is.
Since the infector leaves her conviction, "patientity is not my strong side, perhaps it will be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the way, but he explained that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalytic that reveals the secret: "the morning is really open and the symbolic is a scar."
The protagonist stepped up lightly and concluded that "the wound had only been able to learn so much that it was actually open and that it does not exist", but it acquired the belief that the pleasures and instalments in the language must go hand in hand together.
The writer Valenzuel was playing with both.
Nikaragujec Sergio Ramírez also appeared with a delightful story called the Praise of the invention in which the finger is not appointed in the wound, but at one moment it will appear.
With the elements of magic realism, she tells about the famous witch who played the clouds, she brought back the people who went far or corrected the honor that one virgin lost, this story, which then turned to speak America, a great novel, in which from the beginning his own cinitors who had not been told, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the overshooting of the captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (the writer), laughed at the foged testimony, which was presented in the stories as real, but in another way, was never able to tell the story of America with such imagination that lacked even shame."
However, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have greater imaginations" and just where the reality and the lie, where they don't know what of the story belongs to one group and in the other, reaches fictional literature of its peak.
That's really called "cervant's tradition."
"Thanks for his legacy, we have what we have."
Following this, Mayra Monter emphasized and commended the diversity of the interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her besided Prst to the wound.
The Cuban-portorian writer has shown her finger on a great blow of social violence that passes through her country - and it is shared by Latin America - and it is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended," said after she said that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of a compromise that is formed between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
He closed the Spanish poet Luis García Montero tonight, whose performance also emphasised "to this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer."
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual habits and consciousness control, which overlooks dogmatism, it is forgotten that "that behind every attraction there is little not, and for every denial is also small yes".
"To be the masters of our thoughts and reality, we have to color: and color it means many times to insert the finger into the wound and harass those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in caricatures, black and white, in fictioned ideas and without coloring, and also to harass authority that prefer this black white world," he said to support the sense of writing.
Romano goes to his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, experiences good and bad during his career, but has already achieved three occasions on the decisive series.
in the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the finals, there are two different styles that are characterized by their techniques, teams that have clearly different results among each other.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the finale, he experienced good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve at three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he left with unobstructed, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian had to be satisfied with the silver medal, remained a step for the winners, and was curious to play with the same team of the following final.
As a coach, the Santist stratég got into his first final at the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he had atěže of the Morelia Club, with which he undergone a total of 4-2 against Toluka; then he went again to the decisive duel tournament in Clausura 2003 and lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna Club in Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" from Toluka, Rubén has suffered again defeat, although his team played against "Uzenaires" (the other nickname of the Deportivo Toluca Club - recognized) after 210 minutes of the game indefinitely 2-2, after a series of criminal shooting got into the advantage of three per single and had two chances to seal the title, but eventually his three players missed 11 steps and so suffered a turnover on 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Black Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and dispose of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm obliged, and the title would, of course, be for me, but it's the first thing," said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
In memory of the previous finale, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we took the lesson that until the arbitration ends, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action as well as players, because the last time with two penalts, we were ready to go out to celebrate, and I think we learned in this until the match is over, we can't celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, believes to his players: "You are never trying to come to a series of criminal kicks, you try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option, and we have to be ready for it, in the last tournament, we have been prepared, unfortunately, but the fate has come to us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, something left and hopefully not to do something like this."
Romano has a chance to stop being the other one and to taste the glory they bring in the titles for the first time.
The United States shall amend the rules on visa granting
People will have to turn to the Centres for visa applicants before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and shortened waiting hours.
From 10 January 2011 the visa procedure for the United States Embassy and Consulates will be amended.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centres of the Visa Applicant (a shortly from the ASC) before an interview at the Consular Department.
Personnel from the ASC shall take biometric information from the applicant and shall be evaluated before the interview by the Consular Department.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The overall costs for the processing of visas will be lower, no longer need to be paid for the agreement of the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and the other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall only pay the only fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to 140 dollars per tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to recover their visas will not have to attend an interview with a consular official, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and will be taken of fingerprints.
Since biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting at the Consular Department will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will be asking for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay extra fee for the service of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of an alien life
The U.S. Space Agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break when searching for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aviation and Space Office (NASA) will notify the United States tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 hours by experts on asthrobiology, science that deals with studies of origin, evolution, spread and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that she would introduce a "recovery that would cause a break in the search of extraterrestrial life", which raised speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures living in non-hospital conditions, which were considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that one of them will become intelligent creatures such as humans, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
It is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono lake in Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in a environment that was considered to be too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arse.
The creature uses an arsenic in some way for his life, and this is what his ability increases the likelihood that life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arzene in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know".
The Space Agency shall notify the real range of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conradová, who is studying the possibility of life in Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with a perspective that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produces opposition "block"
The reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", declares.
The 60th parliamentary period has not yet been launched when the opposition block was established in Congress, led by Members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "Strana democratic revolution" - he did not.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana of Work" - notic.), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda" noted.) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the House.
Before the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period of Felipe Manzanarez, Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "grim" against the reform of the Constitutional Act, as it eliminates them.
This reform, they repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - remarked) and Luise Cárdenase Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo indicated that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality from the PRI side pop (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolution Institutional Party") and PAN.
He stressed that during the following days they would speak to representatives of the parties of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will be resubmitted by these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When the coalition came here, I look at it, because we're out of any decision, they don't even want to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia said that they match the PRD, PT and Patron, and that is why they will form a pluralitarian group.
It is impossible to allow Congress to continue after being monopoly is now "duople".
The aspiration of the law reform is not to be an endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to gain more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, by PT, explained that at the present time the Congress became the "core" of two - in the incision of the PAN and PRI parties.
"Since he was controlled by only one side, two of them are splitting it today."
Patrón Montalvo asked her to respect the personality of the Members to give him a place at the table of action.
"In order for five Members who are likely to be nine, but now they see us in five, we are not left behind because of clamped agreements, each in another fraction, we have united to find a place at the meeting table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed and agreed, we stand outside, and we disagree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos for "addresser" is issued.
The town hall in Mazatlán pays another check discussed by the company owner supplying electromaterials.
Another check for more than 200 thousand pesos was sent by the councilman by Lorena Guadalupe Camache's Palazuelos.
Thus, the sum paid in this second half of the company's company's supplier of electromaterials reaches 1.200.000 pesos.
According to the website of transparency, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16, this year, he was exposed to the sum of 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was stated "compensation of unpaid payments".
The Treasury of Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was followed by the Chief State Revision Office for sale at high prices, another charge.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall owes her, and how many checks will still be sent to Camache Palazuelos.
"The purchased was nothing now, only pays her what we owe her, just like the other suppliers," said in one conversation.
The last checks appeared in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October, and this last 16 November.
While this business has not yet been published in the Government Letter, as it provides in the case of companies examined by the Chief State Revision Office, in order to avoid the use of their services by other administrations, the Treasury has ensured that the supplier has not reused the City Hall’s service.
in the past, 25 July, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the council to its suppliers, which revealed that, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel Lópeze Sáncheze, the city of Camache Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she dropped checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist because of the bad status of Sáncheze Taboady in Mazatlán.
After the fall of foreign tourists to deeply on the Sáncheze taboady belt, the tourist sector in Mazatlan asks the authorities to pay attention to the areas and places that are in a bad condition and do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of destination, and the bad things the tourists find here to replace them with new activities or routes.
He pointed out that the bad condition of the streets and the sidewalks affects tourists who are going through and seeing a mess, which adversely affects close businesses.
"The police don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they don't have the idea of the markets they avoid, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these things for so long and without proper planning."
The hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and prevent such a recurrence from being repeated, he will have to focus on preventive maintenance, not just to correct existing failures", said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, since not only because we are a tourist area, we should do maintenance, for as residents we deserve a clean residence, the city hall should change its city maintenance strategy."
There are also other places that look negligible and poor, noted, such as Mazatlan Emblém and El Venadito (monument, statue of deer - noted.).
"In the present time, tourists don't care only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city swiming the purity of their beaches and streets, where a permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out", said.
"The needy attention has not been disclosed here, and these facts highlight something that is well-known, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places to be handled in cooperation with the council, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and good to be attractive, because it has the potential of tourism.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the subtitler of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is irrelevant because they are not properly used and do not do good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, which, however, will need to be fixed first, so that we can put these places into a list that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results after Congress
Eduardo Dawalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take a great responsibility by taking an example of finding a better Sinaloy, in various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period of full dignity and without agreements between the parties and the State exequencies requires the Mazatlan business sector, because Sinaloa is denied in cramps and faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergencia and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new Congress members is to be able to carry out decent management, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dovalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of Congress take a great responsibility and go an example on the way to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect Members to exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overlay that would move the ruler forward in accordance with the order.
"We want them to do dignified work, and they are primarily obliged to companies and sectors, because they were residents of Sinaloy who gave them their voices in previous elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, expressed that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will take all the strengths to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very complicated.
The most important thing is that they encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
As far as tourism is concerned, he asked the new legislators to give him more weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is unsuitable because it is an important economic activity, which brings walnuts and investments, which, in addition, directly competes with agriculture."
In addition to spending the means of starting tourist projects, Congress should help to provide the state with certainty and help with the Alcoholic Act that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the wish list of children in the Coronad Valenzuel family.
For their parents, the coming holiday of the three kings will be hard to fulfill their imagination, as their home counts exactly 12 people and one barran.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they desire so much.
The family lives in a modest residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as father does not have permanent work.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because husband's not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I'm going out this afternoon with the "crabs" on the street selling," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like doll Barbie.
As for the ten-year-old José Alfred, he'd like a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month brother Jesús would like Cayetana's clothes in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I said to him 'see my son' because it was very expensive', he remembers Cayet's sadness.
For older children who were just in school would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, which is 11, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isaías size 10, while the eighth Miguel wears 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis, so he'd really like a couple of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Searching for the Three Kings", and at the reception of Noroest's journal bring a gift or money in cash.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
Tens of tours were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, in the liquidation of the network for production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced with different charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"approximately 750 guilts of Indian hens, four kilos of hashes, money and equipment used to produce was confiscated", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Quebek Police.
Overall, eleven men and three women were arrested, both of which suspected the bosses of the whole network, two men from Sherbrook.
Arrested persons had to come to the court palace in Sherbrooke after they were arrested.
They could face charges for the production of Indian cannabis, its holding with the aim of trading with him, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These surveys took place following a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public, which allowed us to access these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional investigation department of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the state police in Sherbrook and the Sherbrooku Memphrémagog Police Administration.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The proposal of the Conservative Act, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will clearly be overcome while all three opposition parties on the Wednesday said that they cannot support it.
"I have a significant measure of leaning on the Charta."
"I stand right on the side that built the granite under your legs," said the leader of the liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a weekly session of du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the proposal of the law, as proposed, would be a law that would allow any person coming from the ship identified as a ship carrying an illegal immigratory to be detained by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill because he was heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so let's see what the government will do," said M. Ducep.
The NPD critic of the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, refused critics who want her party to be strong enough as regards illegal immigrants.
"The non-democratic agrees to take measures against illegal immigrants, and this is what we consider to be a part of another draft of the law, C-35", said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill of conservatives, because he blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year", explained Mrs. Chow.
Minister for Immigration Jason Kenney accused opposition parties.
"The Canadians share the fact that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are taking Canada on a shot and treating it like some kind of sloppy."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, responded by Minister Kenney.
The Government has not voted on confidence in its draft law, which could lead to the country's elections leading to its refusal.
One conservative said to the QMI Agency that the government will ask for the vote to be answered by any member who is opposed.
New Unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the notification , the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion , many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigative committee for the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, seeks not to forget this idea: Quebec intends with the Department of Investigation from New York to consult this issue in January next year.
Metropole has been available as a permanent countercorruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement didn't surprise one of us.
It should be noted that when meeting the Standing Police Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil was present.
More than that, it was not necessary for a public security critic, party PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to recognise this notice as a "crab pulled out of the hat" and "Amateur solutions fused on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who fear that political power has too much influenced the possible future of unity.
"To be satisfied with confirmation, you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness interview in public trials.
"Morely, Mr. Charest is proving that he doesn't want to create this investigation committee, and people think, like you and I, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of the investigative committee is to demise Jeana Charesta", explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Politology in the Institute of Education of High State Officers.
In order to be able to come out of this blind alley, Quebek suggested that he grant a special mandate to the General Inspector to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Inspector", he decided.
It also believes that Quebec could give the Inspector the same powers as the Commissioner, to allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in Chareste's government's files.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Treasury Code so that it would be better adapted to this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would be based on the authority for the operation of Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law for this kind of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his fellow judge, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendments related to this file.
During the operation of Jaro 2001, which affected a group of bikers, although the Criminal Code has not yet been adjusted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes in the Law on Gangstering.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water flows have been under strict control due to strong precipitation that have fallen from Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauriciu, there was a landslide.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening there was another landing in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's moving.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions affected a strong decline, i.e. raining from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday night, according to regions.
The sections in the north of the river and the Outaouais valley were hit most.
It could have fallen up to 100 millimeters.
If we read these falls of snow accumulated in some sectors, some water flows can be feared by flooding.
Quebeku's rescue service announced a warning on Wednesday night from the danger of the flooding for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood emergency and continuous control.
In the area de Lanaudière caused a strong decline in the divorcing of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, one provizor bridge was struck as a result of strong rains.
Two residents had to be preventively evacuated.
In Outaouais the sealing of certain lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency and supervised the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a safety advisor.
The Quebecké Centre for flooding issued a warning from the strong floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blaming
The Quebecký radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial insight before the Canadian Radio and Television Council (RRTV) standards due to controversial statements on social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as for gross expressions during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Board considers that Mr Dupont and his Group of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative detection of the Haiťans of gross expressions that do not correspond to the broadcast broadcasted during the day".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the transmission of names of both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Board received several complaints relating to comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken after the complaint of the Joint Front of Entrepreneurs of Quebec Social Support.
The group complained that the amounts referred to in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators must provide reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the Commission members concluded that the report transferred was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the contested episodes of "Dupont lunch messages" have encountered a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no conspiracy to him.
The last dispute was the statement followed by an earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort put in a media shootout that caused many reactions.
Moderator CHOI declared that he did not send any gift to help the Haiťans, because we cannot know with certainty that the needy would actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unauthorised, but that their cumulative effect creates an unfairly negative image of the Haiťans.
"I've already offset my three-day delay on this thing."
"My file is intact for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expressions.
Anyway, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated "over its obligations".
For a station that will have to communicate this decision once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, there are minimum consequences.
King du kungfuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special run.
The Athlete, which is excellent in "Sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), enters the kickbox and Thai box with dads and rings all over the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started with fighting arts like kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who lives in the capital since 2008, to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for games all over the place, because for those who don't like the game on the country that appears at war sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this person who works as a protector and as a helper for UPS has just added bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at World Cup Championships in the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the category of kickbox full contact and Thai box, said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in the san shou."
"They were invited by opponents who ended up with the first four in the last world championship in each category."
"I won the bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, I ended eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China, I ended up in the tournament in the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I ended third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"This is the pace I'll be the first one this year or an egg!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China, where the strikes of fist and legs are allowed, as well as throwing on the ground.
Matches take place traditionally on platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of battle is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well-known in the world of fighting arts.
However, Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, confirms his brave participation in the "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The Winning Semi-finals will be held in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will be held to be crowned by the only champion, the king of kung fu."
450 bargained millions without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed with 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts is a consortium created with BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which acquired the most important contract, a project management contract of a total of $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Énergie gérance, was authorised in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec in order to confer its responsibility in the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, "Energie gérance" received a lucrative contract without any public competition.
For Quebec's side, the complaint on the consortium of businesses is facing a serious problem of ethical character which risks the exclusion of competition and causes price increases.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people no longer do side agreements secretly, they're already making them open today," said PQ Sylvain Simard at the press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked the National Assembly because he says it is hard to deal with how public interest can be sold like this.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, argued in the afternoon, denying that it would be on this collusion contract.
"I have my own way," she thrilled and said PQ was "unfair" and "was out of accuracy."
She said, "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited at a time that allows two or more companies to collect their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complicated with regard to the coverage of the work.
The construction is already running and must be spread by 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without competition; it was a business.
It is also necessary to admit that the formula of consortia is no longer the exception of Quebek, even in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the formula of the consortium in engineering consultancy is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly in the speed of the business register to the quebeca companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortias, while some of them seem to be created.
Thus Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
As regards the consortium of Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the land of la Baie James is a typical special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that forced us to shrink the fact that the project management contract was concluded in agreement.
"If you're going to the public competition and if there's few participants in the competition offering, your offered prices can be higher."
"You have a choice of two options: that you will take away people who are in this contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, "Let's make a satisfactory deal and a good price."
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of people," confirmed Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie Guarantee consortium is part of the long list of contracts for more than $50,000, which was received by the Quebek Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification of Le Devoir, he counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with the laboratories, carrying out the analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin shredded 22 contracts, from which Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in "Énergie gérance".
All contracts have been closed.
The total is $449 783 344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that four companies that are part of the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "the great known Liberal Party of Quebec".
Ms. Normandeau has released a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before it has specified that they are rather its managers.
Barometer responsible for consumption - "green" label does not create confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebecký Consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development, but also in "negative" markings and environmental certificates, in order to be managed in order to select products.
The worst thing is, even though we bathe in the media universe, which urges us and encourages more socially responsible consumption, this media universe suggests the lack of reliable information, the failure to fulfil the obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, Baromètre says the responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption has increased in 2010, so called socially responsible products, the inhabitants of Quebek who are trying to sell them, they still don't believe too much
In fact, two thirds of us say that they do not believe in the promises of companies relating to the environment, just because the green advertisement of companies finds the measuring tool that the Observatory has developed the responsible consumption of the University in Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of the consumer doubts the credibility of official certificates, such as fair products, but also the credibility of products and marks, which are ecologically responsible, indicates the Barometer.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this subject is accepted as serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be the primary tool for stimulating this site of consumption resurrected at the present time by almost a third of quebeced consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the doubtful nature of the information would mitigate the excitement of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromère identified at a higher price of these products.
Finally, the third population of Quebekus builds incredibly against the mentioned product data or "green" services that we seek to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits in 2010 and especially change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
The entire 61% of them preferred the purchases of traders from their quarters and preferred the purchase of foods grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Quebeku likes to present itself as a king of recycling, which seeks the least possible impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience clearly remained somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebek's population stated that they use mass transport or that they recommend using a car to drive at least two persons, in order to protect nature.
Walks and wheels also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey that used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the complex of the cinema eXcentris
The Quebek Government, which we requested for a financial participation in the purchase of a cinema complex eXcentris Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation of the company but only to the amount of the loan.
The Developper company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to purchase a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent's boulevard and who showed her mission as a lover of film art, did not find what she requested.
The Government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebeku government proposes a loan, which would be lower, some were original expectations which could build the basis for viable solutions under advantageous conditions and resources originating from the State.
The first action plan and the demand for 12,8 million have already been rejected by Quebek last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the action plan sent by the Minister St-Pierre President of the Company for the development of business in the culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the cinemagraphic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have time until 31 December to respond.
However, the hypothesis of the gift from the State seems to have to be truly rejected.
Note that the association of owners of cinema and cinematographic centres in Quebek was built against direct state investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, stating that the Minister of Culture should not finance the project concerning real estate when it did not do so for other cinema.
On the contrary, several participants requested substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got his cinema in the space within ten years of film art, after he himself financed the construction of a complex, which could be a reason for altering the state's financial board.
The lack of halls for independent films is screaming in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in its forehead, runs a campaign to release funds into the private sector, in faith that he will cut 700 000 dollars for pushing the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only of three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and show the most beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group thinks about the suggestions for the reductions that he has done to him.
Lifting the tires to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic springs listed in the knowledge of WikiLeaks reveal what the United States consider to be a complex of the less-valued Canadians against the Americans, but they also reveal their feelings of superiority to Canada.
The American diplomats therefore wonder that each Canadian voter lies on the heart of Canadian-American relations when he comes to vote, and believes that the visit of President Obama helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, among which were the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, published yesterday on the public viability, provide more sensitive details to get one another under the skin.
Communication with dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the midst of the election campaign, explains in detail what point of the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
For the great admiration of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides a few explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian complex of minority, almost settled, mentions possible political leaders to talk about internal bets, instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in a free trade campaign in 1988)" writes.
"The United States are therefore," he closed, "a pronounced elephant in the following elections: all-time, but potentially too threatening to talk about them."
The Ambassador understands this "deflecting silence" that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the parties or even better the head of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Other comments of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help to ensure the preservation of the government in the vote on confidence at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget that Canada publicly confesss its first deficit in over ten years, due to the recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
Nowhere mentions that the government had to postpone the prevailing session of Parliament so that it could not be defeated by coalition and that the opposition parties would mention their survival of the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, notes Washington on the more negative picture that is throwing dramatic shows on the United States broadcast to CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcasting of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe not too satisfactory references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnapping for the purposes of violent interrogations in the CIA.
Another report refers to the fact that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is ready to accept some prisoners from Guantanam.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of case case case.
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "He forwarded some paper concerning Omar Khar, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret."
"The secretary has accepted that the file will revise."
Let us finally know that the people concerned by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former consultant very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destructed".
Mike Huckabee came in and heard about it in the United States.
World lighting Renewal Plan
Last night, in Cancún, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, business lighting and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect limitation (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the further restrictions that must be achieved for the stability of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is located at the stage of large specific projects that the UN wants to sell in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficultly implemented commitments to reduce on the side of industrialised countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if hot light bulbs that monopolise even 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace the fluocompact or, even better, the light bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the major amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet would be detonated because of lighting.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's an equivalent of 70% of emissions from the car park all over the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, have joined voluntary plans for reductions that should allow the global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it will need to be deducted from this balance by 5 Gt to achieve a stabilisation of climate heating at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be ruled out that it will not be out of control.
In hot light bulbs 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5% is the product of light.
With fluocompakt light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL light bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice.
Fluocompakt bulbs will last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new light bulbs with DEL, such as those put in the production of Philips this week - this company allegedly participated in the UN study - have a predicted life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot light bulb, which gives us an idea of possible saving with a compensation plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations to fluocompact bulbs as they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, provided that the manufacturers would establish collections.
However, as the report states, the main source of emissions of mercury on the planet is not a fluocomb light bulb, but rather a heat coal power plant that releases many mercurys needed to produce electricity frozen in hot light bulbs.
Only in the United States, these centres put 25,000 tonnes of mercury in circulation per year.
The report also detailes the profits each country would have made from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars per year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 equivalent to 3.5 heat plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The Ivory Coast is impatiently expecting the results of the elections.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast after the deadlines set out.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election committee to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results, stressed the spokesman of the United Nations President."
"He asks all parties in the Ivory Coast and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to abstain any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressures raised by some foreign governments, the election committee had the most recent date - Wednesday midnight - without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday scrutiny.
About 40 minutes before the deadline has expired, President CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission's "continues at work" so that she can declare the results.
In the middle of the world , challenges have been multiplied to the CEI finally declare the name of the winner of the second round, between the departing Laurent Gbagbo and the member of the opposition Alassan Ouattara.
But Gbagbo's camp relies on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for the "subsidiary" votes in the north, which former rebels of the New Army (FN) have managed since the failed state reverse in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Presidential Electoral campaign in the Coast of the Ivory, confirmed that the manoeuvres of the intimidation of voters practicing the FN (New Army) in the north of the country, were deterred by the adversaries of President the Coast of the Ivory from voting.
Elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Board took into account the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, the opposers of President Gbagbo believe that the Supreme Court of State is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dre is in charge of him, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far that he would demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he suffered loss, and that he lodged a complaint to the Constitutional Council after defending the election committee to send the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, taking place on Sunday, was considered to be a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two half years.
The United Nations pointed out in the midst of the political fraction of the Ivory Coast that it could be acted responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, October 31, as the winner with 38% votes compared to 32% for Alassan Ouattar, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (BIT) has remained stable to 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7%, including overseas areas), as demonstrated by provizor data on seasonal deviations (CVS), published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in the metropolitan area.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active metropolitan population and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, unemployment rate increases by 0,1 points.
In a wider shot, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether they are available or not in two weeks to work, regardless of whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of current young people in the labour market has yet to act with a new increase in unemployment of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25%, including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 were not working.
As far as seniors are concerned, they recorded a mild increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as a year), that is 482 000 people from 50 years above and 6.6%, including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 has benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a field on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday rates 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of the waste treatment firms and the PS brother of the Bouches-du-Rhône Administration Council, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of a public procurement investigation, allegedly erroneously acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of the abuse of the property of the company, the abuse of public funds and public property, the confidentiality, the provision of bribes, the acceptance of bribes in order to influence the office and hold the ammunition, states his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists on explaining with the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, and not any delusions."
"It's easy to persecute him because of many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client was questioned.
Mr. Guérini, through his lawyers, said that he sent the judge a brief message before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to ensure the operation of the dumps he was supposed to manage.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their functioning, Mr Simon never knew of anything like this.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former CEO of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was accused on the Wednesday for the abuse of public funds and a complot, and was free, under judicial supervision, of the ban to meet, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to give an explanation to all the facts he's been experiencing."
"The investigative judge will look into it and leave it free", said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Another four persons were accused and released on Wednesday nights from Tuesday to Wednesday, with the fact that they were under judicial supervision due to two of them, said D.A. Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, representative of the Director-General with elegance Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for receiving bribes to influence the Office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are accused, one for "discretion and abuse of the property of the company", the other for "complot in the abuse of public resources".
Finally, the business partner of Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "covering the abuse of the property of the company".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been accused of fraudulent public contracts concerning Korsica.
Investigators suspected his company that they helped to wipe money from large gangstering.
The investigation shall be conducted under several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters relating to alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the field of waste.
From the source of a close investigation, the search focuses in particular on the allocation and functioning of the dumpster in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille community (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elyse Palace exaggerated the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss's deputy, young researchers arrested in Iran for "spionage", united the views in France, diplomacyded in combat emergency and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this was carefully followed by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elyse Palace explained his strategy to the Americans, and he went so far that he gave them advice on how to handle such cases hostages in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, Iranian prisoner in France and a wanted American justification for the long-acting of material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they are subjecting to the sharp light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The Diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has a title: "Iran:French's comments on how to solve in the case of hostages".
Advisors of the Elyse Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Central East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend to the Americans to do the same for being transported back to their own nationals by violence detained in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "constantly express the word in the media "basic human rights", "innocence", "resolution."
It is necessary to bring Iranian regime into trouble, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more, the more they ask you to stop."
Because there were attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "it's not going to solve anything," the Iranians are "the masters of a avoidable manoeuvre".
Mr. Richier reminds me that arresting strangers is an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for "political blackmail".
It announces that the exemption of Klotilda Reiss (which occurs on 16 August on the day on which the French Embassy will provide it with refuge) "si will require the payment of a high financial amount to Iran" (caut 230 000 EUR).
And they'll announce that the Elyse Palace anticipates hostage cases, the phenomenon that's going to "exterminate."
"In the future, the Iranians could arrest another 1800 French living in Iran" states.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, which the United States declares to be expelled for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is released free in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
As many observers, American ambassadors are questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, who is chasing illegal Iranian networks to acquire materials intended for nuclear programme, the expansion of Majid Khakavanda is bad news.
France joined the bargain?
Freeing Iran for the liberation of young French?
In the next interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elyse Palace, as he says, was not only "invaded by the judge's decision," but he was looking for a way to stand against it.
"The talks between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice have been made" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "French Government cannot change the judgment," notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "represented" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elyse Palace adviser dials the phone number, hangs the phone headphone, and then informs the American diplomat that Iranian is currently in Paris buildings managed by Iranian ambassador."
At the time of imprisonment of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elyse Palace develops efforts, negotiating, through communicating and organized "emerging" into the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "relevant" and "influential" role of the mediiator.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that manipulation brings its fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" of French officials.
What is based on such a degree of gratitude, expressed in relation to M. Assad, asks ambassadors in Paris.
"In spite of their statements full of praises, French officials, in private, recognise that they have only a weighty idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
Then the document deals with the reasons that forced the Elyse Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "intended to validate President Sarkozy's opening policy with Syria", analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "the way he exaggerates the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, what praiseers can earn when he plays a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also "seat the grain of a mess between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows from a very good source.
August 11, François Richier told him: "We don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them."
"This should at least bring in the confusion and uncertainty between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it in the Elyse Palace.
In communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our countryside".
End online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean Government will adopt the law called "Pecivalian", which will ban the adolescents to play online games after midnight by blocking access to them, the responsible government agents.
The legislative proposal will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Ministry for Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep" said to AFP Jo Rin, leading a minister in charge of the law.
On-line games will be newly accessible from 6 in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, specify.
The government also presumes that it would ask companies to limit the time of access to these games every day for young people whose parents are asking for this, to complement the responsible worker.
It also gives available to people who ask for this free programs to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "dependent" countries and daily printing brings regular facts associated with intense internet use.
At the same time, the country is an indispensable master in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals for World Cyber Games, faced 58 other nations.
World Championships in 2018-2022: Fifa renovates host countries.
The full concern, due to the suspicion of corruption, is established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday the World Cup Land in 2018 and 2022, a selection of politically motivated, where the fight on influence and lobbying risk prestigious technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal Competition of Fifa in 2018se will be held in Europe, the traditional basin of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgie).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will manage to reach new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere in the African continent in 2010 or continues to be deployed in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities involved in the delegation (David Cameron, Princ William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Princ of Qatar, Heads of Governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the economic and political betting of the world.
negotiating behind the scenes faces the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Spanish-portugal (2018) and the American (2022) have the best arguments as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not be too much weighted for 22 members of the Executive Commission at an hour for vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adama) might have destroyed the chances of its country, the cradles of kicks, which had hosted the world championship only once in a year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when she sent out a document that "whispered on a pin" three powerful CE members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unsatisfied and bring into trouble the English leader and David Cameron first.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to reiterate the move that succeeded by his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, which in 2005 managed to acquire for the London Olympic Game Organization in 2012.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to add England a new gloss to its name at the CE (European Commission)?
There is nothing less certain, because the Spanish-Portugal pairs do not miss the trumpets of already prepared stadiums, its prosperity (Swiet's championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliation measures against the English and doubts about the paymentworthiness of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider even in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declare "the unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in the vocabulary, only hardly distorted on the charges of the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We're gonna throw the mud on them, try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seem to be a logical favorite with their considerable experience in 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the heads of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a great lead ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature to both countries, which together made a "examination" in 2002.
Another threat: granting a 2026 world championship to the China, which he desirably wishes to Fifa, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who pulled a large ace out of the sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion to new landscapes, but these two countries represent more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for the chatty fees of TV (because of the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a momentum force for Fifa.
Second mandate: Clearness (jistota)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke up the appearance of he vague.
The valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate even in the smallest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less than them.
The Elyse Palace Mandate calls on someone else.
The current head of the State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But apparently, it's not good to share secrets related to the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persisted constantly.
In one and another sense.
In 2006, without wanting to believe that, Jacques Chiraca's friends were entitled to avoid the third mandate.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "it will sometimes decide in autumn 2011".
As it recalls the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday night in the Elyse Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has led to a little bitter condition.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President only pointed out that the 2008 Constitution Adjustment reduced the number of five-year term offices to two.
It was from his side of the statement, not the announcement.
It's not the first time that he recalls a humorous tone of the presidential election during such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you've got seven and a half years ahead of you", he switched over with me in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His previous statements will not be made by a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make it less than a candidate.
If they make comments, it's due to two truths.
Accelerating the way to the candidate for the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolèn Royal's collar, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to conviction.
On the contrary, it is because his 2012 candidatery is evident that many in PS want to arrange for the battle assembly rather premature than planned.
Bad survey on the other side.
First, the right voters would prefer Françoise Fillon's candidature before Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and we are not discussing the UMP thing," responded immediately and carefully people from the closest area of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes possible defeats, he won't run," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He'll still believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with obviousness.
Euro: The Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Council in the year had to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the emergence of the crisis or, at least, the notification of the termination of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis of the sovereign European claims undertakes, an institution for issuing securities will no doubt be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of deterioration of the situation today already so tense in European securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, at the occasion of the press conference, the French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde gave up an active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of the crisis resolution of debts of European States.
She didn't want to say if she thought that the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their programme of purchase of sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners... "
The President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, in Brussels, in his hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, did not appear to be more pronounced in terms of its intentions and satisfied that he said that the programme of purchase of state titles on the secondary market "continues" and that "see how we decide" during this Thursday meeting.
Only security: The Central European Bank will guard its fundamental illegitimate interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds made by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the misunderstanding of the market contractors, yesterday, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Total Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts between market anticipation agreements on continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change in course.
If the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank, this last designated bank shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for the duration of one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, the economist Commerzbank.
"The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely" assumes Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
The European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the poor market," says Norbert Bäms.
In view of the exposure of European banks to markets with sovereign debt in the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the lack of investors on the market at any cost and act in such a way as to prevent the payment of the paid performance of the States, belonging to the most fragile," said last night a major bond manager.
Because if the interest rates go away, the states will be more concerned about it to reduce their debt instead of stabilizing it.
It's the saving of the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi has a back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the worrying situation has a little slowed down, yesterday with the recurrence of bond interest for 10 years.
Back to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the Presidents of the Regions said that they heard Giuli Tremonti, how he qualifies the situation as "unsolvable" and that he expects a "unforeseeable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest reached a record of 210 basic points and the price of the bankruptcy contracts (CDS) was up to 263 points, which caused certain disturbances in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 fundamental points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said that he was too busy with the "destructive development of the markets" and possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Obviously and unscrupulously, her problem is the lack of growth and the impartial fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and presents the state of risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were cold showers for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis, at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission is calculating the public finance deficit will represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (as compared to 3.9% of the envisaged government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as instead of 2.7%).
From there, the reputation of a new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken", the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn, evaluates.
For the present time, Italy adopts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economy are fine and its calculations are right, we repeat it for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian member of the International Monetary Fund’s Management Board under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short nor long term, because through its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR) is the efforts to stabilize required in Italy less than the efforts required by other countries", says Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE's main economist.
There is still a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the proposal to express the disbelief of the House of Parliament, and after that, they could begin to organize the elections counted at the end of March.
A period would be initiated, not suitable for the adoption of a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated it on Sundays throughout the day and night, they are clearly very solidary determinations, engagement to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, relating to interest in European state bonds, it brought water on mills to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Bureau announced that it could degrade the record of Portuguese debt, the targets that are most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real insufficiently transparent and obvious policy, which depends in particular on banking systems", says Exane BNP Paribas.
More than that, "political time goes slower than market time."
The science of this discontinued context and the danger that covers intensifies the European countries' discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance, the most concerned problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are evolved very well.
With regard to the Eurogroup meeting and the Ecofin group from the beginning of the next week.
The Central European Bank meetings are being held today.
The programme is the fate of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries with market focus (see above).
As regards the European Fund of Finance (FESF), his Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has provided on Tuesday in Singapore a trip to Asia with a view to informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of this journey is not to increase the funds, it is prepared for the land to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for the next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official representative informed the agency Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funds by direct engagement in the FMI.
The countries first, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid traveled differently than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid international assistance at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on structural reforms, necessary to gain everlasting confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of standardisation of markets with sovereign bonds.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether 750 billion euros of mobilised Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not hesitate to reinstate the supply of securities.
Barclays Capital’s Economy, an actor’s first trading plan with European sovereign claims, considers that the addition of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "radi" by direct granting financial liquidity.
There is an appropriation: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is the subject of EUR 60 billion on this day.
The Council, which has all the chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have been worsened.
Snow and ignition: 24 regions have orange emergency.
Snow allocations are still causing problems in transport, especially on the roads of other classes in Bretane, and there is a risk that distorts certain economic activities.
Twenty-four counties have an orange emergency since now because of the risks of snow and nails.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined the 20 districts which have already declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snow patterns cause problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and weakly snow on the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the areas concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
They are affected by the districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow patterns are large enough to cause transport difficulties and distort certain economic activities, predict Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts have forbidden a heavy freight transport - cars over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
The road traffic on the roads of other classes in Bretani is very difficult, and the police recommend to travel with their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Pikardia, school connections were banned for Thursday.
No special measures for the restriction of freight are expected on Wednesday night.
The district office "invites all car drivers to be as careful as possible on roads and to adapt the nature of the car".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airline companies to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport Roissy and 10% on Orly due to the expected snowflows.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to join their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick and Edinburg Airport are closed until the quarterly wound in the south of London and in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the discussion on the modernisation of transport to the Ile-de-France in full stream, it's raining billions.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of 23 billion to the Grand Paris Metro to build Société du Grand Paris.
For this construction to be launched, the State has notified the grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is purely theoretically the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its double source on contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Rectification Act, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set to secure these funds.
There are two: setting up special equipment tax and increasing office tax on the Ile-de-France.
First, let's read in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The rate of this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the price for the offices already exists, "to be upgraded to increase the yield gained from it and that this increase affects Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that take?
Confused.
This is not quantified in text.
We're up to 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion from capital subsidies that will be mobilised by the State and entered into Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
Us in SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
"From the moment we have created revenues (tax, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then count up to 4 billion, explains here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are still unacceptable subscribers, is risking a rather disturbed parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be December 7th.
Fuzzy hackers and pathetic explorers
The WikiLeaks case has double meaning.
On the one hand, an apparent scandal, a scandal, which seems to be a scandalous face in the face of hypocrisy, which is governed by relations between states, citizens and printing.
On the other hand, it speaks about deep changes at international level and prevails the future of the Regreses controlled.
But let's go ahead and do the right thing.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that each document composed of a secret service (which nation) consists exclusively of printing cuts.
The Americans about the way Berlusconi's sex life is reported by what everyone could have read in any newspaper for months (all except those two Berlusconi owned), and the lack of caricature profile of Kadáfí has been a long time for cabaret artists for sketches..
The rule that secret documents can only be made of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookstore, which focuses on the esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Men) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (or not know where to seek news of the existents), but because those who are involved in occultism only believe what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informer is lazy, and a lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if it is not, he could be, as I know, editor in the Lebanese newspaper), who considers to be true only what he confesses.
Information with high secrets about Berlusconi, which the US ambassador sent to the State Department, were the same as Newsweek published a week earlier.
So why has there been so much trouble about revealing these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, and that ambassador, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of the States can call or fly to a joint dinner, they have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into the spy centers.
Any viewer watching movies about the investigation knows that it's apparently ignored only from the licometer.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly, hanobly the obligation of hypocrisy and it throws the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information the most powerful country of the world represents a hard blow, not unnecessary, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "confidence".
But let's go from here to deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to capture all power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since, thanks to the possibility to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, used highway, and so on, he has become a citizen of an absolute victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even "grobes" with the most secret power information cannot resist an intervention of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - chosen as a revenge - can know all the secrets of power.
How can the power that no longer have the chance to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an obscure secret (and the unobtrusive secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious unobscure secret because it is extracted from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secret of Hillary Clinton was unobservable secrets, means to take away all the power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound by power so important?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on a poster glued on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely obvious that with the current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep a message on the phone undercover.
There's nothing easier than finding out whether and when the head of the state traveled by a plane and joined one of her colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept in the future ?
Well, I know that for this moment, the forecast is a science-fiction, and therefore it is fantastic, but I must imagine government agents, who are transporting discreetly formality on uncontrollable routes and carry only the reports that they know, or rather, hide rare information in the heel of the shoes.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in the drawers of closed keys: a total spy attempt in Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward now, that means backward.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogs) allowed the movie lovers to dream a movie step by step, move it forward and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (numerics) allow only to jump in chapters, that means by macropors.
Through the speed-lovers, we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to the horse-treated cars.
Last point.
Another time, the press tried to understand the secret of the embassy.
They are now ambassadors who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked her promises about financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test compliance with the promises for quickly unlocked financing (referred to financing with a rapid start (fast start) or premature), implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were revealed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the developed countries committed to grant $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France € 1.26 billion (this is 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew out a large ace to convince its partners about the realities of its commitment to finance fast start: a report specifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, a distribution of brochures...
Transcendible operations and valued to their true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to act equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010 it released EUR 2.2 billion, which brings it to the right path to its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Agreement in order to ensure that the burden is increased without public development assistance to harm.
Unfortunately, there's no match in what "new and extra" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international funding was maintained and it added 150 million for three years of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with dates at the level of public aid for development.
On the other hand, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the overall aid amount of France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decreased) is to comply with its commitment to finance "new and additional"...
Another decisive element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 € borrowed is equal to 1 € to the donated.
Obviously it is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for certain investments that are profitable (it is often projects related to reductions in emissions, consisting in more effective technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get, as equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments but as a price of loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rate).
However, France can only justify this: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million, making it 91.5% of the loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of the gifts (€36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country of the Union that uses the loan on such a scale.
The Germans claimed 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (with others) comply with their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the complete majority of the European Union gives €1 in respect of its promise, France will only give 10 centimes and considers this effort comparable.
That's a beautiful beetle!
For a summary, when financing the "fast start" France operates with two shafts: on the one hand, with the development of a share in time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only EUR 36.1 million, it can convince that it spends EUR 420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although Bercy is the one who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (Why would Member States continue to donate when they just lend?) and in the negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The premature financing chapter is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But she could be a grain of sand in an enormous machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw the knowledge of this first year of early funding.
First, France should notify the change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its commitments and decisiveness and justice with other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should prevent the debate on deposits in long-term financing (other essential chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way the loans are settled.
France should change its attitude to become so progressive in these deposits as it is with others.
The hopes are all put into the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who arrives in Cancun next week.
Surprising notices about the fast start of France and its vision for "additional" and the use of loans could create an increase in international confidence level necessary to continue in discussions.
The pesticides alert that the kids will die.
The 10-year-old child will eat on one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published in this centre, from the Association of Future Generations (ex- Move for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "no significant statistical value with regard to a low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic for the processed issue", bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child approximately ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water daily - as well as candy, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
Bilance plate is crushing: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are listed among carcinogenic, possibly or probable substances, and five substances are among clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disturbing for glands with internal excretion (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"However, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual substance are not exceeded, in our research we see that the reality in consumer exposure to contamination substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or the PE is irritating", reports the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain about ten rheids with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogenics, as well as about 20 residues that could disturb the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, presented studies as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in lunch, where studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat biscuits, tuna in a can, and even mushrooms and gum were polluted with pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrate and chloroforms in the water of the analytical couch revealed.
Steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 found chemical residues and even analysis of plastic plate used to heat up food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contamination cocoa" is likely to be underestimated", results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Society (EE-LV) has proposed "sharing in the face of an urgent situation" to establish a moratorium for the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereal.
