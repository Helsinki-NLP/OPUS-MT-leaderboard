Eighteen-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The eighteen-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the stairs of the local business this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't think who would want to hurt him, and he adds: “He finally started to do it.”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eighteen-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, said the office of a medical examiner.
The Sanfrancian Police Department has told us this is a violent death and an investigation is being carried out.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, for the ABC KGO station, in San Francisco, said that Frank, who was a former leader in Boston, won his dream chef at Sons & Daughters' restaurant six months ago.
Speaker restaurant Sons & Daughters said that his death was “washed and destroyed.”
"We have a small team working as a closely connected family, and we will miss him," said the spokesman.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and grief belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the hostels, but recently “he finally started to do it.”
“He found his apartment, he dated a girl,” said Louis Galicia for the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he wasn't wondering who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to connect to his family, he always made us food, he made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any fights.
He was a brother who took things the way they were.
"And if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the inflammatory diamond that shredded every day," he said.

The Czech tracks invested over 31 billion vehicles in modernisation.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the past six years, he invested a state carrier in modernising vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
The third vehicle is currently equipped with air conditioning, approximately half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in each year except in 2012 are gradually decreasing.
The Czech tracks in the last six years have invested over 31 billion crowns in modernisation of vehicles.
The third vehicle is currently equipped with air conditioning, approximately half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown in a reduction in the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
The larger proportion of the investments was put by the carrier in regional transport, with about 60 percent of the money mentioned, and 40 percent of the company invested in the renewal of vehicles for remote transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is now 19 years old.
However, modernised older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of CD vehicles would have increased by ten years.
A little older are in average personal wagons whose average age is 23 years of modernization.
If only the age from the date of production was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classic combinations consisting of wagons and dragged locomotively, however, in recent years from Czech and global railways are gradually disappearing and replaced by motor or electrical units.
Between 2011 and 2015 locomotives from 280 to 223 pieces, similarly the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the mid-year.
In particular, the carrier was disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles scrambled.
For example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speed up to 200 kilometers in an hour that the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic speed tracks.
The contract shall calculate the collection of up to 30 motor pieces and 20 electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a fourth year, they can't get rid of it.
We're absolutely powerless, they admit.
Already a quarter of the year editorial online journal Aktually.cz is watching the story of billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where it is not only an interesting tourist walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know it's black, but they're saying they can't do anything about it.
Similar advertisings are hundreds of thousands across the country, maybe thousands.
According to the officials, the law is guilty, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards right away.
The first use is a complex bureaucratic wheel.
Meanwhile, the company will change the name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad by a few meters and the official process has to start again.
Road and motorway headquarters admitted four months ago: at the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno stands on our property on the state road advertisement billboard black.
Not three months, but the officials were not enough to get rid of an unauthorised transmission structure with a giant advertised poster.
It's like no one's mind that he's standing right next to the car, in a 50-metre protection zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers say they can't just consult with billboard because of the law.
Maybe we should load him up and get him out of here.
"We can't just afford that," says the spokesperson of the Road and Highway Nina Ledvin and refers to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of billboard must be preceded under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online journal Aktually.cz to watch in the spring detail, yet it is not is is isolated and points to the general problem that cannot stand and the authorities to deal with effectively and quickly.
Only in southern Bohemia, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile advertising placed against the rules just next to or near the car.
Similarly, there are other countries.
"We have the difficulties of the company to remove the liaisoners," confirms the head of the Czech Republic transport department of Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klasa, the law of officials is guilty of the guilt.
First of all, the billboard owners have to call to give the advertisement away.
But the bosses are often unsatisfactory or know the fint that has already been updated.cz in the past described when the issue began to be more concerned: just a mobile stand with a commercial shift by a few meters, and officials may have the prior challenge to remove black advertising to throw into the basket.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we must address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could have brought a new law that would ban billboards at the highways from September next year and limit them on the I. class roads.
The critics point to the fact that the rules for the abuse of illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on hire of illegal areas and no one can.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
The officials know it well: the Czech Republic's magistrate with it currently leads three administrative proceedings for blackly built billboards.
The company is in danger of a 30-month fine in each of the proceedings.
This is more advertising that were placed in the protective zone of the I. class road without authorisation.
Drivings are not yet closed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Czech-Budějovice Mastership Transport Department.
The advertisement that the Actual.cz is not interested in, although it is not yet drawn between these cases, soon but most likely it will come to them.
According to the spokesperson of the Nina Ledvin Company did not respond to the repeated written calls for removal, and the case would get to the regional table and then probably to the Magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspected companies that cannot be contacted.
He doesn't take the mail and the official residence in Žižkov canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind her.
In the past, the company went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who heard a sharp dispute with the boss of the Czech representation of the brand Hyundai.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard is renting and offering space to the advertisers, however, has in the past refused any connection.
At the same time this spring, when the RSD started on the initiative Actually.cz interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer had the state officials send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension where allegedly the new company is established.
None of the highway managers have yet heard from this address.
A futile fight.
Similar silence or blurred changes in the seat are not unusual.
One company we gradually paid fines for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed the name and the ICO and there was nothing to deal with.
The doctor's case returned, the commercials stood up, maybe in other places.
We're quite helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admitting to the condition of maintaining anonymity of one of the officials.
No one is dealing with the new law in this regard yet.
Currently.cz spoke with several Members who have taken care of the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, Members who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government has rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also regional and general policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrnetic topic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand they need them themselves because of the advertisement in pre-election campaigns.
I don't get the fairly established impression that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.
The farmers will clean up less grain this year, but more beetles and poppy, estimate statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the harvesting of cereals will be 6,7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the rape harvest (o 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Cereals will be 6,7 percent lower this year than last year.
The farmers will clear 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate that, according to the status of the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July, published by the Czech Statistical Office.
The initial estimate of a month ago was more pessimistic and expected a tennis decline against last year.
The last year's harvest of cereals was superdirective.
This year's crop exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the rape and the poppy harvest will be higher this year.
The growers will clean up by 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they got 1.256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5% higher than last year.
The expected decrease in cereal production is caused by a reduction in the hectare yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes from hectare and by a decrease in the nasal area.
The farmers sucked by three percent less of the fields this year.
Wheat wheat, which is the most important cereals for the Czech Republic, will be recovered by 3.3 percent this year, according to the estimate.
The farmers planted it on more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Some of the five-in-line decline in statistics are foreseen in spring barley, which is most often used for the production of beer.
Reduction of crops is worth 15,2 percent reduction, but even lower hectare yield.
On the contrary, the barley is born by 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also grow.
The breeding of the rapesees estimates 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
Seat surfaces have expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectare return will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's crop of the rape exceeds the 10-year average of 13.3 percent, while the seating is more extensive than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there's also a field with the poppy.
This year, the farmers planted it on 35.543 hectares.
Against 2008, when the poppy in the Czech Republic grew on record 70,000 hectares, it is half the fields.
This year's maca harvest will be richer thanks to the enlargement of the open surfaces.
It's up against last year by 2.5 percent to 27 423 tonnes.
But the hectare return will be 6,1 percent lower.
The Olomouc police officers accused two men of attack with a knife and machete, the court sent them to custody.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old man on Tuesday at the center of Olomouc.
"But the attacker tried to escape, he was caused by settle and cut wounds that required treatment in the hospital and other treatments," said police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
Both obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack.
The applicant has filed a motion for a court of law to put them in custody, and the court has complied with him on Friday.
Both men are at risk for three to ten years in prison.
The police accused two arrested for assaulting a 35-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and machete.
Attacks caused him a seed and cut wound, a man ended up in the hospital.
The attack prevented an incident between two groups of people who took place on Tuesday on the right noon in the Freedom class, said the police.
The perpetrator ended up in custody, informed the Olomouc Police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
A massive struggle between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar near the centre of Olomouce.
After an aggressive vocabulary, two attackers attacked by a knife and machete of a 35-year-old man.
Even though the attacked man tried to escape, he was caused by settle and cut wounds that required treatment at the hospital and other treatments, the police spokesman said.
During the fight that raised great attention in the city centre, and for which there were some police patrols and officers on the scene, there were family disputes.
Criminals of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a seven-four-year-old man from Olomouc accused of attempted severe harm to health and riot.
The applicant filed the motion of the court to bring them into custody, and the court agreed to him on Friday, supplemented the spokesman.
They used the mačetu in the center of Olomouc also five years ago in the mass battle of attackers, it was then just a few dozen meters away, before Varna's disco in Riegrova Street.
The police said that a group of about ten aliens with weapons attacked the guests of the company who stood before the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, holes and machetes in their hands.
Then the Court of First Instance punished two foreigners by a conditional punishment.
The abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most cruel examples of the unused and empty house is a large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Senov Square.
She was supposed to work as a hotel long ago.
But it's still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of the Václav Square is a number of spacious houses, which, despite its location, size and often also a monumental protection just empty and wipe empty.
We selected immovability in the center using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, of non-transparent relationships between companies or of a state that can't or does not want to get rid of them.
Empty homes are more than homeless in the Czech Republic.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, he wants an initiative

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton exprezident, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were devoted to Clinton's charity.
Most Clinton income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The candidates of the American Democrats to the Presidential Office of Hillary Clinton published their tax statements on Friday, thereby increasing pressure on their Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton's exprezident, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP.
Most Clinton income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husbands took over a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year and then a tax on income at national and local level of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of income on taxes.
However, Trump has had a similar problem, so far he has not decided to publish a tax confession.
There's a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on twitter a few minutes after she published her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secret about Trump's income, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her opponent is actually as rich as she claims, the AP has said.
Trump's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
The lower earnings would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who has been running for the vice president in tandem with the former first lady, published today a report on his tax receipts in the last ten years.
Together with Anne Holton's wife, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings on charity and paid 25.6 percent on taxes last year.
In Nigeria, the defense broke again.
Islamists from Boko Haram defended consistent vaccination and killed a doctor.
In Nigeria, children's armour cases were rediscovered.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared exceptional vaccination, because there are two children infected with this disease.
The vaccines were transporting helicopters there.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended the vaccination and even killed the doctor.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the virus was unseen there.
In the northeast Nigeria will start an exceptional vaccination of children against armor because there were two children infected by this disease.
In Africa, the defense was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be vaccinated in Borno and four million more in the surrounding states.
The Nigerian military helicopters on Friday according to the AP Agency quickly transported the vaccines against children's armor into the affected northeast part of the country where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the virus has been circumventing in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also on Thursday have prevented doctors from reaching the area where children with armor were detected.
Both affected battalion came from refugees from the part of Nigeria newly released from Boko Haram.
Director of the WHO section responsible for the excretion of the Michel Zaffran station BBC said that vaccination in Nigeria will start next week.
In Borno, the Islamic radical group of Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was made available to international organisations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
The Nigerian Minister for Health Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of defense were greatly disappointed for the country, because Nigeria wanted to announce that the defense was eliminated next year.
WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease had not emerged for two years, it was spreading among children.
The children under five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, there were half of all the cases of defence in the world in Nigeria.
While the defense was still in 125 countries in 1988, it is now only in three areas - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the motivated stories of fallen women.
Pope František met 20 former prostitutes who escaped the pimp gang because of the police.
The Pope listened to their hard stories of life and invited them to look for faith in the future.
František wanted to draw attention to this meeting to trafficking in human beings and to call for a stronger fight against him.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome that police have released from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church has listened to the motivated stories of the fallen women and then invited them to look forward to the future with confidence, the spokesman of the Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes František visited there were six women from Romania, four of Albania, seven of Nigeria and one of Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All of them, according to Vatican during forced prostitution, were exposed to severe physical violence.
The visitor wanted to pay attention to trafficking in human beings and to call for a stronger fight against him, said the Pope’s spokesman.
Francis often warns the fate of people at the outskirts of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in Vatican this year in April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit the jihadists' productions.
Without helping the Muslims, it can't be.
France is fighting radical Islamism to help Muslims themselves.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and spiritual education.
Since last December, we closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And the other will follow, the Minister of the Interior has announced.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If the Muslims do not help the state in combating those who infringe public freedom, it will become more difficult for France to guarantee that freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it aims to ensure that only imámists who were educated in France are preaching in mosques and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing the mosque from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from foreigners for the construction of new mosques, the most of Morocco, Algeria and the countries of the Gulf of Persia.
For this reason, preachers who can settle radicalism in France get themselves into the mosque.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key that will ensure the achievement of these objectives will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, is now active in the country.
The foundation had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and countries that finance their construction.
But soon, the institution affected internal disparities and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
In the French political scene, Charlie Hebdo magazine attacked in January 2015, the debate on a new institution, which replaces the non-functional foundation.
All of them have accelerated other terrorist attacks in France, which, in the name of the Islamic State, have been performed by the traditicalized Islamists.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve has recently heard that the new foundation will be created this year in October.
It will have two main tasks - ensuring the financing of mosque from home resources and also supervising imámas.
For now, it is not clear where it will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centres.
But a few suggestions are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, the vendors would pay a halal of food, and it would be for certification.
A part of this money would go to the money of the foundation.
The contributions of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mexico.
Every year, on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, there is about 30,000 of them.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who went through special educational programmes at the French University should operate in the mosques in the future.
This should ensure that preaching is in accordance with democracy.
Let's close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in the opposition to radicals.
And the other will follow, has recently announced the Minister of Interior.
In France, there is no place for those who speak hatred in mosques and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are about 2500 mosques and prayers in the country according to estimates.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have spent about 80 imams and a few more tens are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the government's steps can hit a lot against radicalism.
Those who want to radical themselves will do the same.
It does not happen in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Centre for Research.
Kelemen Trailer lost a sprint with Baugem's star in the first round.
The procedure within the eight-finals must be fought by the Czech tracker in repairing rides.
Driving cyclist Pavel Kelemen in the Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro after the sprint qualification procedure among the best 18ths played a fight in the first round with the French Greater Grégorym Baugém, the defender of silver from previous games in London.
The procedure within the eight-final shall be fought in repairs.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track, 27 riders were built, and the best Czech tracker of the present took the 14th best time.
Two hundred with a flight start reached in 9,969 seconds.
At the main elimination stage he was expected in the qualification of the fifth Baugé, who already has from Ria bronz in the team sprint.
Although the tribe had been touching on an experienced French man in the conclusion, the process was held.
Great performance, Jason Kenny's advocate of gold flashed.
The eighteen-year-old British drove the third fastest two hundred history and the qualification won in the Olympic record 9.551.
It was easy then, according to the expectations, to consult the last progressive German Maximilian Levy.
The British Quartet was also successful in a building with Bradley Wiggins, which took a new world record of 3:50,570 in the race for 4 km and went to the final.
The current maximum (3:51.659), which belonged to the British four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
The representatives of young doctors have gathered together to approve of the new steps in their dispute for a new contract.
The Council of young doctors (JDC) in the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full Council to support further professional events from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the Ministers' questions about the contract have failed to resolve.
Young doctors and students of medicine voted against a contract agreed with BMA in July.
58% of its voters were rejected.
In the letter of members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained “and remained silent” for questions, which was great to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive authority of the JDC decided to vote in full by voting on the proposed new treaty and to ask for new formal negotiations in all matters.”
In response to the government's silence today, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of missing branch events from the beginning of September.
Spor led a young doctor this year to publish up to six hundred, including the first general strikes in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
The BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the treaty would be a burden for medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Society of “Incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Heads of Russia and Turkey gathered on Tuesday to serve their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long vocabulary wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the great palace hall in Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted more to do with this reconciliation.
It's been hand-held, yes.
But Putin wasn't smiling, and he barely made warm, even according to his measurable standards.
On the contrary, Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “hell friend” to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to its level before the crisis, but will be even better.
Another day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad has ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm has revealed the opposite.
But the lasting cold that was emitting from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech: shooting down the Russian battle aeroplane by Turkey at Syrian borders.
The reaction of Moscow was raged at that time.
Putin handed the wounds around himself and Ankara accused Moscow of hitting a knife in the back.
The disgrace was more likely to lose from a suspected friend.
Rebuild the true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media led a massive global campaign against Ankara after a month.
Suddenly, it looked like the Turks were all over it.
More serious was the allegations from the Supreme State Representatives about Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denyed this.
But there was an official message in Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he asked from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of publishing the truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during an unbeared rifle last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken them.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a hard impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists every year to Turkey's coast.
This number decreased by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies will breathe here if there is any renewal of flights.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables once the imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey were again authorised.
"Turists there, tomatoes back here," as the news in the papers of the House.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what he considers to be a chase response to attempted conversion.
Moreover, the long-term inviolence of long-term talks about the entry into the EU and the entry of Putin - which is eager to use cooling and breaking Turkey's handcuffs with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the chosen organs after attempted puppet.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has deeply rooted fear of changes in the mode, this is given.
So the summit in this pompous, oral palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to show what one of the analysts described as “uncompatible”: how they combine forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has been built in the role of the peacemaker recently, but where Russia and Turkey are standing on the other sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of introductory interviews, both presidents at the press conference said they did not mention this question.
The Turkish President deliberately looked at the answer to the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common speech on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and due to the risk of a complete disaster, when a member of NATO, Turkey, has shot a Russian battle aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotska
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark should be repressed to the back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to global bank ambitions.
Of them, she fell off when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redempted from debt.
At that time, the loss marks used the ‘RBS’ to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It was worth millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from the ragby championship of Six Nations to champion Winbledom Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more excellence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scotland customers but will not start new business.
All references to the RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of centrals and stock encoding, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more to the front - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the trip to our customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered us about Ross McEwan's questions.
Stanica BBC Scotland said: “The RBS find will cease to be our investor brand and brand for which our employees work because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands.”
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying that we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have efforts to focus on the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations championship, prepared a profile of individual sport sponsorship brands.
“The time has come for us to move to the bank brands, because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers,” said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we'd become a great customer bank and introduced the brands.
But together with how we focused on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there are many changes.
We can recall these marks, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket riding Predilection led to the goal of the 3000 winner
Dettori sprays champagne after his double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Frank Dettori made a 3rd victory in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone has reached its second victory of the evening on its local line - on the horse of Predilection, which John Gosden trains.
Eighty-four-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that has achieved such a result in fair admissions.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-fold champion of the Dettori, who previously won the Ghayar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here too.
I'm so glad this happened in Newmarket because I've been stuck in here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge action, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations after the victory brings the Predilection
Two jockeys of this milestone have reached in obstacle ranges - the champion of the jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-fold champion of Sir Anthony McCoy's pension, who led more than 4,300 winners to the goal during his career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold winner of Derby, 4,493 winners in career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is not a surprise to reach a milestone that has reached only a few riders before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fistron that differents it from the other riders in the weight.
He's a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only been going on weekends and big racing, he would have already 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie was driving a winner in Great Britain for a larger part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living nature, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
Since the summer finals to the summer jump - Frankie Dettori was a messenger of two decades of British equivalent races.
It was like riding on a mountain track.
The imminent number of winners of big races, including its known “great Seven” in Ascot. He also survived a plane crash and had a ban on the run for drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a six-month start ban, but he showed incredible internal power and all the doubters came back in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has already declared that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the president of the President's office Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivan's head of the President's Office unexpectedly on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
The 30-year-old Ivanov was appointed Ecology and Transport Special Representative.
The Kreml statement states that Putin “released Ivan’s service from his head of the Russian Presidential Office,” but there was no reason.
His seat will take over Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
The four-four-year-old Vajno was a former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he worked at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that later he was the chief of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
When he appointed Putin, he said: “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your state head activities in the sense of the draft law and control of the extent to which your instructions are respected.
Putin stated on Friday the Russian television station that Ivanov asked him to release from the post and recommended that he replace it just Vajno.
Will he persuade the smiles?
This step was completely mystified by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of the closest associates of Vladimira Putin and as has been Putin working for KGB for a long time.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country as head of the presidential office.
At the meeting with President Putin, who has broadcasted state television, both men have declared that the president's office is leaving at his own request.
But the smiles in the cameras persuaded just a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who once considered himself as a possible president would suddenly want to lead the ecological policy of Russia to meet a great disbelief.
The Kremlu pages quote the comments to Putin, in which Ivanov says: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in the interview to give me this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Looks like I was the president's boss for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Before then, he was the Vice-President of the Government and the Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was commanded by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin joined power, he named Ivan's one of his five closest associates.
It was even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin's State after his second election period, because the third period would be contradictory for Putin.
But this post took over another close Putin’s associate Dmitri Medveděv.
Putin became a Prime Minister only three and a half years later before returning to the President's Office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the crime scene show, was released after he hit the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
Television stations ABC and CBS, which are producing, announced in the joint declaration of release.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised on Thursday before his fired.
There's been creative differences in the scene and I don't agree.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in the statement.
According to the ABC and CBS television statements, the details of how the figure of Gibson disappears from the series that watches the stories of the FBI team, somewhat later.
The four-fifty-year-old actor, who celebrated the main role in the sitcom of Dharma and Greg, was in the show since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of criminals and in the past 12 years I have put my heart and soul in them," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be there until the end of it, but that's not gonna be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and especially the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series until the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden fish
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand eels that left a water stench.
The Bain, which lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his finding in the idea that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters fish in his garden got.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects to Fife
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the north platform and Queensferry Crossing and viadukt - the bridge now connects to Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four locks between the “first platforms” that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The portion of the Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 curtains.
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first people who came from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historical moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all aware of how construction engineers have used more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and masses of the bridge, completion of the clamp between viadukt and the delicate bridge of operations required exceptional accuracy.
In its place is now more than 79% of the total bridge area, concrete for the last part of the platform is now flying in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expanding platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
This is what we've done by pulling the North Approach viaductu of 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and very delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viadukt is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be drawn up with about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance that the team worked with was very small - only a few millimeters each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy that they are alive”
Three men are “happy that they are alive” after the water washed off their fishing boat near Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI's rescue boat station reported the alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre's bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued indefinitely.
"We saw their boat crossing around and we thought the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind took him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved a local fishing ship, a third man at 60 years of age was found without a rescue vest exhausted as a fight stick.
They were all handed over to the shipment of the coastal rescue boat and transported back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “There are three men who are thrown into the water who are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The ship's engine had a rope for an emergency shuttle, but somehow there was a disconnection from the person who drived the boat when the reverse happened.
Someone up above those boys held a protective arm.
The judge refuses to solve a case for the Lunar's wife.
Petr Tluchorř is one of the three Members who, according to the charges, were to get from the Prime Minister Nečas and his former head of Jana Nagy's political strike, i.e. a lucrative post for political retreats.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Snajdr, Fuksa and the Hudder allowed him by their resignation.
Then they appeared on influenced posts in state firms.
They also faced suspicions of bribe and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, unauthorisedly, almost two million crowns were expected to be remunerated.
He's now deaf as a witness after the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works in a courthouse in the Fruit Market and deals with civil disputes.
Yet, she wants to be Judge Helena King cautious (disputing criminal matters - note red) and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be in charge of another Prague court district.
The king, however, has already deprived the blame of Jan Nečas, before Nagy.
It was the alleged abuse of military intelligence to follow the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, the Hunchor didn't imagine.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreact.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to rule out the court if witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to be judged then, noted for a journal.
"I think it's bitter," he added.
Roman Boček, former official, is also charged in the case of political hits.
According to his attorney, Peter Toman, a possible objection would have a chance to succeed.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the prosecution of the former head of Prime Minister Peter Nečas Jana Nagy (today Nečasová) and others accused of the abuse of the military intelligence.
Nečas and her husband are coming to court.
She was supposed to deal with Peroutk's statements.
For example, the exposlance wife was to judge President Milosh Zeman's statements on the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman said he was sympathizing with Adolf Hitler.
One of the school girls is already dead!
Apparently, the girl died in the air raid of allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two similar old friends last February from the London Gatwick Airport.
The British Home Office didn't comment on her death.
The young Londonmen who escaped from home, according to the police, were secretly transported to Syria through the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana were headed for their other former classmate at Bethnal Green Academy in London.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention, as well as tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
The British security authorities estimate that there have been about 600 British Muslims traveling to Syria so far, about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who come home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred-week salary.
Great paid work you don't even need high school.
That's what looks like at the first sight of the work of the ayte.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only for the Czech ratios of extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to CZK 180,000) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in Czech Republic.
According to statistics, Grafton's personal agency are programmers, developers, engineers' network and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between a few jobs.
It is therefore not a job candidate, but a job for candidates, commented by Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't necessary.
High school education is not a need for an ayte.
High school education means a good basis and is an overall indicator of intelligence and the viability of the candidate, but often does not have much in common with knowledge of development.
Developers have to learn new things all the time, which one of the high schools do not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director Monster Career CZ.
It's the most earned in Prague.
Wages of ayomen are everywhere moving high above the Republic's average.
The most money they'll come in Prague and Brno, it's not like that in the regions.
"Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to the Prague," says Cuba.
Highest earnings will be reached by the technician directors.
In Prague and Brno, they can get 120 000 CZK - 180,000.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it won't even fall below CZK 80,000.
The demands are also IT project managers.
They can make $60,000 - $1,000 on board.
Fight them for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, it doesn't apply to the ayte.
Because if companies move and replacing an expert from another company, they would like to touch a graduate.
They can raise him by their own.
They won't go without a tongue.
The knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at least a decent English is necessary.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is a need for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies are looking particularly for a professionally educated and experienced person and will only be satisfied with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the aid worker controls more foreign talks, he is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he adds Kubačka.
Yo, Googlu, there's paradise.
Only quietly envy Czech workers can work in Googlu.
Of course, it is a flexible working time for them, a possibility of working from home or a variety of short-times, not only for moms.
"The New Tattoes provide a company for four weeks more vacation after the birth of a child," says Martina Joneková, spokesperson of Google.
Health care for employees and family, food, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to educate, my green, doesn't matter what new ones want to learn.
But the benefits don't end.
This free refrigerator is definitely not worth throwing too.
Healthy lunch (in some locations and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, in all offices there are so-called microcookies, where people always find a healthy snack, it reveals a spokesperson.
And so nothing needs to be thrown out, so what's not eaten, he'll put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these for the Czech ratios of incredible advantages?
Create creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions," says the speaker.
The UN strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday that systematically violates human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "invites serious concern about Bulgaria not respecting international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in the statement.
He pointed out that "it's particularly disturbing to be witnessing how important and influenced public personalities express public support for criminal armed fighters that are organized by refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into the Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," stressed Zeid.
What's worse - they're often being penalized and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are being criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, under international law.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - Health and Happiness to pay
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the last decade lament that teenagers and children don't play out anymore and prefer spending time on screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people from the sofa and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens originally stinked on TV, later on video games and newest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities are not excreted outside.
Of course, I'm talking about the fashion Pokémon Go, application based on characters that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (the later was created a cartoon, playing cards and others).
As with many cultural phenomenons, there was also a decline in interest before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
It was then postponed in other countries because of the mighty interest which led to overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users within a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, smart phone players go out looking for Pokemons that are watching with GPS, and when they find them, they can “foot them” (over screenshot on the phone) or “chains”.
Manie boasted a generation that played a game in her younger age, picks her up from the seats and wives her out looking for Pokemons.
In the USA, this game has made a significant increase in the number of steps that a “primary” person does every day.
Cardiogram app for a smart watch from Appla, which is watching 35,000 users, recently for Washington Post said that within two days of the start of the game, the number of watched people who practiced every day for 30 minutes, jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go plays - sees only gross data on the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns that seek to “find 30, ”“ rise from the couch,” and “have been active every day” have fallen into unborn land, because the majority of public health messages are boring and determined by people who do not look well.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot put here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that enjoys them.
You're covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air, and sun rays, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when chasing the ponies.
As it is, of course, there are some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can walk into the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
At their time of application for smart phones, like Fitbit, they could follow our activity, but they didn't give us reason to do something like this game.
The news will look at it and the interest will begin to fall down at a certain point.
But thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people hunt for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles gained gold in multi-faith gymnastics of women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
It's dynamic to jump.
No effort in the hammer.
With the simple ones, everyone was impaled.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally a Olympic champion.
The 19th-year-old American gymnastics went on Thursday straight behind the title in multiboje, and the others on the full line under the Olympic reflectors.
The total result 62,198 clearly confirmed its lead before the silver medallist and member of the "final five" team Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliyou Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the performance at the hammer in the final multi-boje of individuals in sports gymnastics at summer Olympic games 2016 in Brazil Riu de Janeir.
Biles became the fourth American in a row that won multiboje, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation the best gymnastics of her generation and maybe even the best ever.
When her overall final evaluation on the board and her long journey to this moment ended, her tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks it in the same league of individual athletes of their time, like Michael Phelps, who added their sports new dimension:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals for world championships - including 10 golden. Her splendid assemblies are a mixture of ambition and accuracy, and the Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said it was "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test was expected in Brazil, not even so between Bilesová and the rest of the racers, but between her alone and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than going home to your family in Spring in Texas with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raisman is circumcised after the victory of the golden and silver medals in the final of the female multiboje individual at summer Olympic games 2016 in the Brazilian Riu de Janeir on Thursday.
The first Biles received Tuesday, when she was a screamer at a celebration leaving the national team coordinator of Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her collection in simple - the one that contains a typical triple salto for her with a double turn - is planted into Latin music that would just fit home, to the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted her grandparents as a battalion and her talent discovered her mother Coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The competition has not been lost since the summer of 2013 - this is the lead of victory, which can continue as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took a short lead thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Cladin and simple - where Biles defends the world championship - waiting.
She got back to the forehead with 15,433 points behind the hammer - and made 15,933 points in simple.
Raisman hugged her gently when they waited for the final score - just a formality - and around the shiny red, white and blue shadows, the Biles appeared tears when the wishes that she once recorded in her diary.
Raisman's performance was kind of a retaliation for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third string with Mustafino, but then her bronze due to the sum of the three best assemblies.
This time, the 20-year-old captain of the team that Americans call "babcha" was a lot ahead.
She sent a crowd of air kisses after her simple ones, made her return, which sometimes seemed unsure.
For Biles has a contribution that this 19-year-old athlete placed on Twitter this week, where he became a total hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot in listening to music in a car
According to the police report published on Thursday, two women died and a girl aged 12 during the most serious attack of ten years, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, they were shot when they were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot on June 12th in the car parked on the driveway.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from the handgun and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth a three-fold robbery murder because the attacker didn't take his wallets, or the amount of $2 900 that one of the adult victims had.
Speaker police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were looking to see if the shooting had any connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Spanish quarters there were nine attacks in total during four months, in which seven people were killed and two other people were injured.
“It is happening in the villa district before the houses,” said Howard earlier this month for the branch of the CBS station KPHO.
The police believe that the suspect used several cars, including brown Nissan from the late 1990s, black BMW from the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transported to a hospital where she later underwent her injury.
Liner (31) and daughter of Ellis Maleah died in place.
The witness told the police that it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, whose target was an empty van just half an hour ago by a three-time murder.
The investigators found the ammunition and the rest of the bullets in the seat and built a bullet under the engine cap.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephalia: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike its peers, microcephalia is suffering from a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent found out that Edmund might never know and that she might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the constitution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this anymore," explains Picciut.
Edmund's dating a walker's help.
Until the age of three, he couldn't sit or cry, and he still doesn't talk.
Some of the men are already slowly filling.
He goes with help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth performs the sign language that Edmund says, "please, sing to me."
"We teach him a sign language," said Picciut for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says that Edmund made some characters himself.
Microcephalia may arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, such as in the case of Edmunda, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as incinerators or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary significantly.
It's too soon to tell us what the Zik virus will have on the lives infected.
Picciut reminds of the emotional tax that the insecure future chooses.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure about that.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciut has a encouraging report to the mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by Zika.
The situation is getting better.
Know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and large floods in Louisiana have caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and on Saturday, more rains are expected.
The National meteorological service (NWS) announced that after extreme leaking rivers on the southeast of Louisiana and in the southern Mississippi they spill out of their shores and threaten wide floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and assistance is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson of the Governor's office for national security and prepared for crisis situation said they were getting applications for vehicles for driving in water, boats and sand bags.
Steele said only the Tangipahoa district asked for ten thousand sand bags.
The flood patrols will remain in most South Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service in the statement stated that more about 8 to 13 centimeters can rain above the sea.
In southern Alabama there was a flood patrol in an emergency on Friday, when the rain continued in the area of Mobile.
According to predictions, Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are supposed to be culminating on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they can flood a number of homes in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the dangers are floods of the stream in the Ascension precinct, when these distributed flows will only fly slowly into the lake of Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, a little south of the Mississippi State, Liverpool, Louisiana, reached local time on Friday at 9:00 a.m. at the highest recorded levels.
Rescue workers are still picking up people from the floodwaters in the county of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepfather were earlier on Friday between the saved at Gloster.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which are normally more than 120 meters from his house, quickly rose overnight.
He said that his other stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up and the water was approaching," said Hansford.
I had her until the passport.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that the crisis workers saved all three huge trucks in the military style and transferred them to the Gloster fire station, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that the floods are “swiftly spread” and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the observer not far from Livinston announced that from midnight to Friday to morning 35 centimeters of rainfall fell.
Krautmann said the soil is soaked from the center.
The authorities argued that the efficient rain and paid trips requested the rescue of the residents from their homes in the Tangipahoa district and the abolition of teaching in five schools.
WWL station CBS announced that 200 homes were flooded according to the old man from Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated into two churches, which are both but now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that have trapped high water.
In the village of Amite and Hammond, shelters were set for those who were evacuated.
“They will be able to return home when the water begins to fail,” he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipahoa district in Hammond, and the locals were available bags with sand that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last great floods we had here in March," said the manager of Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager for crisis situations in Harrison County, Mississippi, said that on the coast of the Gulf of Persian Gulf, the rain continues.
He said a couple of houses were reported on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods, Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen her before," Townson said, "and she's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "children shot like a case", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's already a second shooting for a child aged six in town.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms and abdomen, but he was conscious during transportation to the hospital.
"He caught so much, his little body was shot like the case," said his grandmother Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy's in critical condition in the hospital and undergone several surgerys.
The station family said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to go to the first class of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two other victims in stabilised condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot at the front seat of the vehicle together with a nineteen-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the men injured could be a shooter.
CBS Philadelphia's investigators said there was probably a gunshot among several armed men.
The ammunition was found on the site of a weapon of the attack type, belonging to various attack weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were bullets on the street on both sides of the sides of the side of the sidewalk.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters actively involved here," said the Captain of the Philadelphia Police, Anthony Ginaldi, for the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also affected in the area.
No one was arrested and the police allegedly investigated video recordings from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in her arm by a blast shot on Tuesday outside the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I imagine a female gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games, just for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been on every summer Olympic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, which is Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of black and Latin Americans on the tip of this sport.
In the past four years, the gymnast number one was African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second side last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympiad, Gabby Dougals was surprisingly a champion of the Olympic Games and America was shining.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, which demonstrated unexpected but gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who gained gold in a female multiplayer fight of individuals.
And a member of the Aly Raisman team got silver.
We're witnessing a sports summit, but in the gymnastics class, it doesn't look that way.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie took the same route to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They're "final five", because the gymnastics team will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi trains.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is financially challenging sports and gymnastics are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, roads, jewels, competition fees, hotel accommodations (for coaches and their trustees and families).
Most of these sport clubs are in rich areas in suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs gymnastes have all training and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, trained both athletes at the time they began in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training, which are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Spanish origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving "the girl's strength" and you won the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to get on the way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter other strikes
Ministers hoped that after the reconciliation of the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the disagreement on changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who attended the elections refused the contract.
Hunt discovered in July plans to enforce the contract with the fact that NHS was in "nothing" and other delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend working procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
Doctor Ellen McCourt, the president of the Committee on Young Doctors last night stated: “Young doctors are still very concerned about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current crisis of the labour force and therefore a fair treatment of all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors passes into a new contract, progress must be made and time runs.
The efforts of BMA to resolve disputes through negotiations were unwilling to engage the doctor and often with the silent silence by the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for extortion and resolve the fears of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations have been postponed and 100,000 visits, because sisters and specialists have been called to attend doctors who have been among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the recast agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be a concluding disagreement regarding the amendments.
BMA wants higher payments for work on a weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chairman of the employers of the NHS, invited young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “A few or nothing of the field will be achieved, but there will be a pressure on the already overloaded teams and services, and the fears, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nurses and their families.”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the council of young doctors and together with the Ministry of Health, and others have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the supervisor and informant.
Employees hoped that the continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as overload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after the break of careers, training costs, mutual recognition of articles, study free and difference in payments between sex - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are taking agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around 60 crowns (two pounds).
Ticagrelor blood clotting medicine reduces the risk of seizure again in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people be given for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them will suffer from another seizure or heart stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat which on the walls of the artery creates a core layer.
If this layer occurs, blood clot may occur, block blood access to the heart and heart attack.
If the clot releases, the bloodstream may continue, block the blood supply into the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
In the draft NICE Directive, which has been published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Center, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there is a quarter of patients who had a heart attack and which will affect another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repeating may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient's life.
It is demonstrated that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already experienced a heart attack.
We are pleased that, in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the possibilities of treatment available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - over three years are limited, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
With computer culture, fraud in Muslim areas began to revitalise
The Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed from the office last year due to corruption, which was linked to the government report
The culture of political correctness has led to overlooking the spreading fraud in Muslim communities, being reported today in the government report.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles criticizes police, electoral inspectors and town halls for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretary of the community, now ruler of counter-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should protect cordons in front of the election rooms and the chosen voters.
He recommended that the voters take a proof of identity and can prove who they are in the elections.
At present, the voters are just going to put their name and address.
The report also proposes to the fingers of persons when giving up the vote to carry an indelible ink in order to avoid being voted twice.
Whistleblers should have more protection, he says Pickles.
Asks the press to have greater access to the documents from the meeting and to decisions adopted by the non-official committees or by the group.
“It is not only a protection against electoral fraud, but also about the protection of the local government from a wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, the special election court decided, the official mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after charges for corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “cynicically hit” the religious sense of his Muslim community and shut his criticisms with racism and islamophobia.
Rahman says: “He has led his campaign so that it is the religious obligation of the Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of theft of identity, when a person votes and votes for someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed a special concern about fraud on the correspondential vote - which is claimed by the older members of the Muslim community during it to raise pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations, how to clear the election system, including the presentation of the identity document
His report states: “There was evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There were fears that... the state institutions have shown eyes before such behavior because of “politically correct” hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean the system, including the prohibition of political activists to manipulate correspondential voices and to prevent "voice recovery."
The report that Theresa May is now assessing also requests more detailed checks on registrations to prevent the use of election lists for immigration fraud and dosage fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit a document of identity before the vote.
Using an indelible ink on the fingers of the person in the vote to avoid being voted twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
The request for automatic correspondence votes shall be limited to a period of three years.
To prevent political agitators and activists from manipulating their correspondent voices and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to create a courtroom around the election room.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons evolving illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Forbid photographs in the election rooms.
Only the English (except Wales) should be worked in the election rooms.
Strengthening training and ensuring that workers comply with the rule that voters go to election cabins individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says that it's surprising that no offence charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Election Judge ruled Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litanii of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubts - in the strength of evidence of a crime.
It also criticizes the unperformanced “checks of ticking fields” in the offices for registration of voters at the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s judgment in the Tower Hamlets case is awake.
Our nation has a proud legacy of parliamentary democracy, but an alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by certain authorities threatens this reputation.
Crazy cycling dual Duchess Kate and other twins of known personalities on the Olympics in Ria
The fans of the Olympic Games in Riu 2016 went crazy this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevote, which is quite similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
But the fourteen-year-old Olympics are not far from the only athlete seeking gold this year, which can boast by their own twin from a number of known personalities - at least not by social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Riu and all the famous personalities that appear at present on our screens, a column for FEMAIL has set up a list of Olympics that are more than remotely similar to the Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted beast: Member of the American team of archers Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonard DiCapri.
Along with Kate's twin on a cycling track, a number of online people quickly pointed out that a certain archery could be a pair of star Leonard DiCapria.
The racer from the team of the U.S. archers Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his images appeared on which he was highly similar to the wolves of Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo since he was a little girl.
"There's no big similarity, except beards," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"He's a loser, and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasised even more this year: a conspicuous similarity between the British jumper to a distance Greg Rutherford and Neil Patrick Harris' favorite actor.
About the Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin with her big, significant eyes, it was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the Southern African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star Gell Matthew Morrison.
And for a change: The user thinks Nathan's a "atletical version" actor from the beginning (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of Rafael Still's tennis star and Josh Hartnett's actors, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same filth and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord, and about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, the fans say that she looks like a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Free women: Hope Sol soccer game (left) and actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter User was very pleased that similarity was noticed by others
The waves of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed its satisfaction on the website that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Football Star Hope Sol and the actress of the show Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a really incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other favorite comparisons, Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of Laura Linney's actress, or the holder of the gold medal for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautifully wide smile, which is like copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, stars of the movie Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologizes for the fact that the Chinese swimsuit said that “she exploded”
The viewers of the Central Live Transfer from the Olympic Games at the CBC station have crashed the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator by Byron MacDonald.
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer during the race “smells like stinks” and “bouched”.
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was disabled when at the end of the finale of the women's barrel at 4x200 meters free style began to snort his own views.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "living" to the CBC commentators team, said: "The little 14-year-old of China gave up, you fool."
Too much excitement, she was pulling like a smell, exploding.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) flew the second class of the race at 1:57.79 - 1,61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
The audience in Canada began to call online quickly and were terrified by the tone and language that commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “The voter at the CBC reported that the 14-year-old swimmer from China “bouched ”???
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the broadcast."
Ai Yanhan, from China, in the final 4x200 free-style female race, was described as: “The little 14-year-old of China gave up, you fool.”
Byron MacDonald criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't stay back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada, and it sounds like a bunch of racists.
Soon then Scott Russel, who hosted CBC, apologized for his live comment, MacDonald, said: “We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped.”
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened."
The CBC station finally apologized more than 90 times to the people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-contributor Scott Russel must have apologized on behalf of MacDonalda
CBC then copied and put their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments by commentator MacDonald
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She's sincerely sorry that the words were said, she shouldn't have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the broadcast and to those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the power of the swimmer, not the swimmer itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on a live broadcast and tried to explain his note by saying that he didn't want her to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment that I said last night after the women's staff," said the Olympics at the CBC station.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person swimmer like that."
"No need to say that I had no intention of disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark horrored by a woman who was shy to try underwear in the middle of the shop
When a woman took off to try her panties on a sales area in the middle of Primark, they were not buying certainty to look in the direction.
To make it worse, she tried how her size fell, her panties took off and put them back in the shelf.
She continued and finally tried four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
Primark shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before she returned them to the shelf
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that a mystery woman, after testing her underwear, “he was dressed again and came out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, “They couldn’t believe in their own eyes.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties out of the shelf, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - just standing there, slim as a monkey."
“Everyone was just staring at how she was wearing her panties again, and apparently she didn’t like them because she returned them back to the shelf.”
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like it, she dressed up again and left.
"She seemed like she didn't mind who looked, nor thought of the person who might buy the panties she tried."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kenta, said: “This idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else had on it and no one cleaned them. That's gross.”
The events occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I gathered things that I evidently tried to pull them off - what is also the only right thing.”
"It would scare me the idea of bringing home new panties and finding out that there was another woman wearing them, undressed them, and that they weren't washed."
Primark spokesman said: “Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th.”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend against the attack of weapons using the Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the very master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly get over the violence, whether it comes near you from the front or from the back.
If he comes to you from behind, he says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free track of the missile.”
Then you'll take the gun between your forearms and your shoulder just before you throw it into your face with a free elbow.
Then the knee goes down to the weaknesses, and while the attacker shines in the pain, you blew his gun out of his hand, hit him the main in the face, and you start backing, while the gun is aimed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fireline, grab your gun and scrub it out so the bastard can't shoot.
At the same time, put force in the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then scrub the weapon from his clotting and start retreat, keep pointing at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get out of the robbery is to spend all the cash if you're not a Krav Maga.
Traveler Ian Wright entrusts the most dirt places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler has decided to undergo a hard test of his immune system and a suffocating reflex - by licking the most dirt and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and author of the Ian Wright travels (51), origined from Suffolk, covered the strength of his immune system with its language by the euro banknote, the Piccadilly Circus, the button of the bathrobe on the train and the Russian public phone.
He used the luminometer to show himself and to all of us what he's in.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide was filmed to Inner Strength, brought interesting results.
The idea to lick the button of the flush in a train that has used thousands of other people may seem completely reluctant, however, in the kitchen sink there are in fact much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright spoke throughout his journey across Europe with doctors and specialists in health care about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the things he licked left him nothing worse than the perception.
Ian Wright was famous by testing the resistance of his intestines on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public railings on train stations to flooding
In the film that he filmed about it, he says: “I haven’t taken much care of my health since childhood, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eat worms and rotten water.”
In the movie, he definitely confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple luminometer luminometer showed the value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after his luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products, Valio filmed the traveler's movie called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
He said in the movie: “This is almost the most intense thing I've ever felt in the bathroom.”
There's nothing dirtyer than this!
I'm not leaving anything because it's disgusting.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish milk product manufacturer Valio.
Mr. Wright provided Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamin C and D bacteria, which help humans strengthen the intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Vice President of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something they'd be watching their adhesives and at the same time would allow us to explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We've invented a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They say that the interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking only about products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the intestines and how this is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have provided more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let's say this, Ian would have lost my respect if he licked something of what I wanted from him - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie.”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others are hard again.
I'm glad we've made some of those dirty things."
In 2015, Valio carried out a survey showing that 84 percent of the respondents combined the lactic acid bacteria primarily with the health of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent of the respondents stated that at least occasionally they were using products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family of the socially needed before eviction destroyed the local building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left a damage of 50,000 pounds on its general house after they were charged with the terrorisation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent evictions from the house, the officers of the apartment cooperative were shocked when they found out that the property was located in a accidental state.
There were holes in the walls, floor covering was ripped, garbage rolled everywhere on the floor, and walls were blacked.
The family has already moved out and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing housing issue, said she was worried about saving the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances must be considered because this property is probably going into awareness as “not so nice part” of Cornwall.
This family is unfairly known, and their names are immortally known.
A couple have three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and the police said that the horror that the family was operating was the street fights using baseball stakes, intimidation of the surrounding populations, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, fights and abuses.
The Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease contract, was awarded in June for antisocial behavior.
In a few rooms in a house that might be destroyed, there were stinking garbage found.
In the house where the drugs were distributed in the past, the floor cover was ripped out.
Neighbors say they saw them on the street fighting, and people called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house by violence this week after they got an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved of the eviction welcomed their lives to be a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care for anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We woke up because there was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisory manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly summoned to the house.
The dumps and old toys were laid in the engraving part of the town house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant could not take responsibility for her own behavior and for the behavior of her family, and that exile is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the local community members who have informed us bravely.
I hope this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors, and at the same time will bear the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of tenants who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Polluted mattress, which remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction.
The workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that have remained thrown around the house.
In 2014, the police performed the bay house and found over 70 grams of hemp, weight, equipment and 1 700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon got a fine when she was found guilty of having a class B drug that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in the car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
The police say they're going to try to evicate tenants who violate the rules of their lease contracts
Angela Crow from Den's and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear message for other tenants who will continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can act unrestly, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
Den's and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were scared after a low flight of military jet aircraft above the beach
The tourists who enjoyed the sun rays in Portuguese Aveir were scared to death
The aeroplane of the Portuguese Military Air Force P-3C Orion was flying as incredibly low as possible.
Military Air Force has declared it was a training flight, and it insisted that there was no danger of safety
At the time when a low-fly jet fell above the beach filled, the frightened tourists panic caught up.
On dramatic footage, the military plane is getting close to the touch of sunshine people on the sandy beach near Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists started to rise after they were disturbed by the noise of jet engines without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreators who published video recordings of a dramatic passage on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low, and at one point it seemed to fall.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
The tourists on the beach in Aveir were terrified when the low airplane appeared from darkness
The Portuguese Military Air Force today declared that the pilot P-3C Orion was on a training flight with a view to identifying a fishing vessel by the coast and had to endure low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aeroplane reportedly flew a little lower than usual because of the bad visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the air force insists that the safety of people was not at risk.
The forest fires destroyed part of the continent of Portugal this summer and demanded four victims on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Military Air Force today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of the dense fog and smoke from the fires that defended him in the view
The aeroplane was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels in the course of training.
Half the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half the burial service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Commercial Inspection (COI) found this on checks in the second quarter.
According to it, burial services do not most often inform the remainder of their prices or do not issue written confirmations of receipt of the order.
The ČOI paid 41 fines in total of 73,000 crowns.
Today, her spokesman Jiří Fröhlich informed that.
Inspectors discovered doubts on 47 out of 95 controls.
In addition to the non-information of prices and missing confirmations, certain funeral services also sold products or provided services at other prices than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold have not been properly labelled and one seller used an officially unchecked measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
This was related to urn packaging, candle covers and vases which were not properly marked by mandatory information.
"Because there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London Schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolers who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Advocate Tasnime Akunjee said that the family learned about her death in Syrian Raction a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Racca, which is the bass group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she was prepared to escape from the war of the dreaded country and to return to Britain.
“The man wants to believe that the only good one on the whole thing - as a message and a warning for others, that this is a real danger associated with the way to the war zone - is that he will depart people from making decisions at any time,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London joined Turkey in February 2015 and then on the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultany family learned that she married an IS- warrior in Syria - and widowed in a few months.
Reid says if Clinton's elected, she'll leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
A leader in the Senate on the democratic side of Harry Reid says that she is convinced that the presidential election candidate for the Democratic Hillary Clinton nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in case of her election.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The Senate leader of the majority of Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the deceased judge of the Supreme Court will choose the future president.
Reid, during the conference call on Thursday, declared that she believes that Clinton will choose Garland “with some degree of credibility.”
Reid's spokesperson later said that Clinton was not directly talking about whether Garland was nominated, and that he only speculated.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to swing a boat by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of the federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that the republics blocking Garland's appointment are "faithants" and "poskock" Republican candidate for Donald Trump's Presidential Office.
He said Trump wasn't fit for the office.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars are for "woman and men"
Magazín Treats closely cooperates with photographer David Bellemer to issue calendar for 2017, inspired by the calendar Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of revealed known personalities, they try to find another generation of top models for their calendar 2017 NU Muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nude is different from Playboy from old school because “Playboy is for men.”
I'm doing this for women.
He clearly believes that the calendar also.
"We have to go back to display overtime and classic nudes, when women and men feel nice and inspire themselves with photographs of the female body," said Shaw in the press statement to issue the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys gramophone boards?
Vinyl loves the loneliness of men of the middle age.
Before you decide to absorb the section of comments with peprimous remarks under pseudonym NeAllOsamatiMuseVetřednym, we will point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so many discussions about the resurrection of the gramophone boards are linked not to the boom of millenals, who want to love the originality of owning physical subject, but with nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are probably the most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not even about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan - the whole has an emotional dimension: the older people who buy gramophone boards are more likely to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and they like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are YouG's results true?
If this blog was sent out as a television report, I would be watched by a camera going into a busy street in Soho, dressed into a decent gray suit and a wide gesture. Then I would stop, pull my hands out and say something authoritative, like, “Let's look at it.”
Let's go take a look at this.
While Soho’s charm and magic are slowly exploded from the heart - buildings once occupied by independent dealers, hotels, restaurants and cafes, confections and office needs - several fantastic specialised stores with gramophone plates have remained.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), Glasgowa, who I am watching from Sister Ray (first: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (first: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London afternoon and is looking at shops to fill out a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3 or 4,000 recordings.
All these recordings scaling the walls of his living room - on the picture up (the picture sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This enormous amount of albums and singles also has because he can afford it: now he can buy gramophone boards that he couldn't afford when they came out originally, and again buys what he sold in the youth and didn't even have a vingry.
"There are some of what I'm buying is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would be released when I was 11 or 12 then I was too small and couldn't get them," he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like society themselves, and he adds: “I don’t smoke and don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new tide of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old gramophone boards back.
According to my interviews, people disposed of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their recordings and purchased CDs now sell their CDs to buy their record back," he says.
That could explain the boom of lovers of gramophone boards of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of the gramophone boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find in a store like Phonica that you can find a pleasant association of people with similar thoughts in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly deteriorated by the system of contact payments.
Some of the fans of the gramophone boards may feel dizzy in the digital world and have decided for the well-known surroundings of the gramophone boards, things that create memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think that filling up the gap or property of something material can bring some comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, it's my place, and I think I'm a lot of people too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in the head.
"We are all their social workers!" calls the co-worker from a pile of gramophone boards.
In April, ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of the people who had purchased a month earlier had not yet listened to the vinyl album.
According to the survey, 41% of the questioned gramophones have never used, while 7% of those who buy recordings doesn't have a record.
At this point of the report, he was probably really concerned about going through a bunch of compiling boss nova.
The aspect of "trofeje" and the recovery of interest is something that Jonny noticed (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle aged men).
"Somebody recently came and said: "I don't have a record yet, but I want to buy on the board of Radiohead so that we can build it on the shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage of these, but it's happening.
It's more about the product page than the music.
People come to us, saying, "I don't have a gramaphone."
They're younger people, not the older ones, growing teenagers who get into this.
Fopp, where almost all of the floor is reserved by the gramophone boards, he has much more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There's a couple of 70s, tourists doing photos, teenagers and women at the middle age.
While the atmosphere is not so relaxed, as the shops before - from speakers, instead of rigid jazz calls the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see various customers.
None of them look very lonely, but you're hard to guess mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes a few minutes to walk in Fopp and look at various gramophone boards in discount.
He's one of those who's looking at the window rather than spending hot.
According to his words, she doesn't make much money, so it doesn't seem like she's collecting recordings.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something like that, but the recordings have their magic...," he'll breathe to the desire.
I can't explain - it's unique.
My last stop is a business that allegedly inspired a new generation of gramophone board lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I'm faced that I'm a very intrigued laundry of girls in stitched jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls that just take a look around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy a gramofone Crosley.
On the left is a staircase whose wall covers Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's gramophone boards: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the base of any average collection of gramophone boards.
No one's looking at them - maybe because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that you can't reach them.
It's a pure "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the Soho depth for another, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more likely more time and money than in other areas, is also the most spent for the luxurious goods that the vinyl is.
But while I find that YouGov's results are accurate - at least in the gramophone board stores, they do not consider a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in fact, in stores with gramophone boards and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn't spend quarterly morning wandering around stores with gramophone boards on Berwick Street, browsing recordings and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV moderator who hides behind the back of the unconscious men of the middle age.
Green shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the grónian shark has the longest mid-life of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is studying sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters.
The court in France refused to break up stores in the Džungle refugee camp
In France, the court rejected the order of offices in Calais to demolite dozens of provizor shops and restaurants in the Jangle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to cancel a total of 72 commission shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, sell tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros in provizor restaurants.
The office of prefects in Calais argued that places have to be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they represent the risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in the court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food, which offers a state-owned association and other groups, does not provide a supplement for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Reliable commission shops and restaurants often provide shelter and food for free people in need.
The court in Lille decided that there is no legal basis that would prevent 72 commissioners from running, but said that the objections of the prefect Calais are “all understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants are much more important than just eating food to people who “are living in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that space provides quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places where the demolition threatened was the cafe in the camp, the Jungle Book Kids, which operates non-profit organization and offers 200 meals daily, English clocks and French and asylum consultancy for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying the camp.
The petition for the protection of the “child” cafe has signed over 170,000 people.
Guardian received a letter, according to which the closure of the cafe “was a disaster for these children, one of them is only eight years old.”
The charitable organizations of Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep rise in arrivals during the summer increased to more than 9,000 - which is so far the most ever.
He thought he was dead.
Shut up, you and the volleyball Ústí.
"I could practice normally since March," reported at the launch of summer preparation in full force.
What were you doing?
I had a two-side pulmonary embolism, then a heart problem.
Because when I was in Korea University, I didn't know I had some blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I've had a clot in two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a damaged vein in the jaw, and it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it works or changes weather.
But nothing that limits me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
Last year, I didn't know that I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there any more.
I threw blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I've been completely settled for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Drzevěnice, my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you get along with that?
I guess I had to live on it, and now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood problems that I have to watch more when I go somewhere.
But there's anything we can do about it.
Only when I wanted to go back last year to prepare the Spectrums, there were still heart problems.
It's all right now.
Since March, I prepared myself at home to be able to play again.
I knock it on, physically, I'm better at it than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to the crew looking good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about two other strangers coming.
Let's just sit down humanly so we can get along together.
Will you pick up the Út?
There was a reputation, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now the second end.
There's a new team in Ústí, there's only a few players left.
It was the last in extralision, so there's a lot of room to improve.
When we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds, who's gonna be an obtrusive, I don't think we do.
Is the guarantee of success of Coach Brom?
He's already experienced, and he's been through a lot, he's going to think better than the last place.
But my coming with it didn't relate to him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I'm a big friend, and it was agreed to operate here.
I won't say the name.
In the end, Mr. Brom came in and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training a lot of decades, he's a good former player.
It'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like hectic, and I like to get an opportunity in a non-school team.
I've been in the Spectrum for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already trained by Australan Boehm in Ústí.
What's he look like?
I know him on the basis of the coincidence, we played against each other in a group.
And we used to hang out there a few times, and sometimes we sat together at night after the game, so we're friends.
We beat them 3:1 right away at the launch of summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
There's an American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, looks like a good boy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so whoever works, I should communicate with everyone.
I was just checking out what the player was, I found on the Internet playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, kid jumping, he's tall.
On Facebook, we wrote a few messages, he seemed like a joker, he would fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of the recording number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only going to be 24, and I'm not having a character to change it.
I'd rather be in the center of the event, rather I'd run the team than run it by someone else.
I guess I wouldn't want to play anymore if I was supposed to be a second recorder and take care of it for full time.
How many times have you been a number one?
Half a year in Příbras, when it didn't go to Kust as a captain, he hurt himself, then there were trouble with money, and he left.
Since then, we've stood up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, whose decorator I was, I changed the number one and two.
The great year was in the Old Town, after him I had a lot of offers, and I just chose the Sovereign.
From there I was asked for Budějovice, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
The short sofa remains the Phelps domain.
"To be back on the stages of winners and to hear anthem is sweet as always," he laughed Phelps, and he had eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother rejoiced in the sphere, the son of Boomer, this time, he calmly slept with headphones on his ears.
I'm spending an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - I started swim racing 20 years ago, and in a few hours, it'll be over, he said, "I'm sorry."
In the Phelps final, two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long half-sea.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Šun, the bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's world championship.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (dial) is Michael Phelps the third athlete who dominated the same discipline on four games behind.
After most of the race, Phelps and the other American Ryan Lochte and the domestic Thiago Perreira held their lead.
While the defender of the gold in the final fifty crabulary put in a crushing finality, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand his unique medal collections in Rio.
Shortly after the solemn publication of the peninsula, he went to the final race at 100 meters of butterflies.
Legend could not overlook the county Ryan Murphy, who won a double marker - after the hundred won in Rio and double track.
In the finale he left 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third ended Rus Jevgenij Rylov.
While last year's world championship, Murphy's only got a fifth place from two hundred, he became a symbolic king in Rio.
Larkin settled out of his thoughtful throne, who had the same double succeeded on the world championship last year.
But he's got a medal on the Olympics just now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiaková and American Simone Manuel.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel's second after the silver of the sixteenth grade.
Swimming gold has won on OH as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to the others.
This medal is for all who come after me, sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, said touched Manuel.
The third was Sweden Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-foot butterfly race in Ria in the world record and has silver from the craularian duck.
Until the sixth World Recorder of Australian Cate Campbell ended.
The first Olympic medal was won by Japonka Rie Kanet, for which it was the first Olympic medal in seventy years.
It has no valuable metal or the world championship, its fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Riu has won Russia Julija Jefimov, which, despite the doping past, is faced with the inviolence of the viewers and the opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don't know why I should answer these questions all the time.
I'm so tired of it, said a Russian swimmer.
The right to take off in Riu was required only by the special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the game starts.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't, or if he has any other opinion, whether he turns into arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were going against.
They must have managed the tactical preparation.
And then, in an unconventional time, the game started on the little court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then the race reached, but at 19:19, they couldn't handle the ending.
The second was clearer and equal, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
First, a number of failed services meant a loss of 10:15 and a goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could defeat the Russians," she regretted Hermann.
How would you evaluate the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game pretty much.
At the end of the final balloon, I've had an income that I've used to before.
We lost a hundred of them, which was key.
In the next set, we entered them with an overview on the field, another defense and pushed on the service.
The tie-break was a terrible messed-up application, we wore this page.
It was disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
It's a pity for the first set, that's where we ran.
We were able to download it, but we missed the scents.
The other set was great, and in the third, he was deciding the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little courtyard number one?
Sluková: Like in China on the side yards.
The center and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, complete silence, music didn't play anything, nothing.
That was the difference compared to the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of the opponent an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the counterplays, so we couldn't do tactical preparations for the rest of the teams.
But Simon (Nausch Coach) has prepared a tactic to almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of papers with a tactic, so on this page we were pretty well prepared.
Remember, would you ever start a fight at midnight?
I don't think so.
We played at 7:30, but not at 12:00.
The block of Russia Birlov in front of the playoff at the OH in Ria.
Beach volleyballs Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in hugs in front of playoff at OH in Ria.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since ten, we had the regime moved earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to serve their best performance in 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it probably won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you value the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the procedure from the group was our target, it's all right on one side, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I'm going to sleep out of this, and from tomorrow I'll only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big brother's here, the first sniffing SIM is coming.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without Thai passports which decide to arrange for SIM to one of the local operators when they stay in Thailand.
Not just tourists, but also people with long-term visas, which, for example, work in Thailand or have closed their marriage.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Office and the Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantasith informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for foreigners exclusively presented the national telecommunication regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures to enable the monitoring of their position are intended to introduce the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security, which will enable the criminal activity of a foreigner who is being committed.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect those who exceed the permitted duration of their stay.
In the case of dealers, SIMs should appear only to Taiwan within a six-month period for foreigners.
The differentiation will be the monitoring function that will be permanently switched on for the cards designated to persons without the Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This is not the SIM function for Taiwan, because we can always follow them easily," added Tantasith.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand there are no prepayments anonymous as in Czech Republic.
The seller requires an ID.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators handed out free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also considers ten telecommunication regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia or Singapore.
They are currently subject to mandatory registration of SIM, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the measures taken do not mean for foreigners the obligation to carry out a local operator when entering the SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in this case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The country’s opponents know only relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after entering the SIM into their network.
They therefore know a phone number, not information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so profound that even most tourists during their stay in Thailand will start to look after local SIMs.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners were legally pending immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and in connection with the protection of privacy, the planned system compares to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if necessary to follow a particular person.
For any abuse of the system, it will be threatened by an indefinite punishment.
"If the service provider is to monitor the position of SIM without a court order, he will be accused of a criminal offence," he added Tantasith.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently recycled until the 90-day period after which the SIM did not sign up for the network, it could have been renewed after 15 days in case of leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose the apartment in the new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the property care will provide the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spots and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older construction.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in the old houses, the problems of swinging the floor, high energy demands and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which old construction is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the Modern Apartment magazine.
The whole interior designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague, Kamila Polák, from Artiga.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend cooperation with the expert to everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if it suggests an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very comprehensive technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of a range of possible materials and on the basis of customer's wishes are able to align the interior properly.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us even when we reconstructed our new apartment in Vinohrads.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wished a generous social and residential area with a corresponding background for the four-member family, considered as modern, but not cold interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of the implementation was needed to be coalculated.
Did you leave everything in the specialists, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior?
We approved all proposals, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we decided what we expected from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think our collection of mostly Czech authors, including the works of Karl Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to orientate in our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and nut wood was an idea of architect as well as individual furniture pieces, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, arts, etc. If everything goes together, then we checked together using visualization.
Did there appear to be complications in the implementation of which you had to give up your original ideas, or turn on new ideas?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the first time, it was possible to climb up to the height of our floor, and they found that the outlooks we planned, in fact, the shade of the surrounding building.
That's when we literally changed the disposition overnight from the base.
The gym was used on the kitchen line as well as on the enclosure of the fire wall.
In the interior then the wooden surfaces supplemented by skin, such as the quilting of the dining and bar chairs of Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to change here, or is there anything you want to do today?
I believe this is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfils its purpose.
We're not going to change, most of the changes after the move took place in the plane of the shade and residence of the terrace.
Perhaps the only stain is to the floor, when the nut wood shows up to us as too delicate to the house with the dog.
Word of architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Horny, author of realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new construction, so it was possible to make a completely new disposition solution and several other adjustments.
For the interior is an important element of the placement of lightwaters into the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
That's how we got the daylight into the darker apartment space.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the swimming pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications which was very useful for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a pool and a whirlpool.
Compared to French, you're not negative, he says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, close to the Spanish borders.
I've been moving around a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I graduated from journalism, which made me get to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially for the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
People in France are negatively loaded in general, but it's been getting worse lately.
It's interesting that you're mentioning negativeism.
This is how some people value the Czech nature.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France because they don't feel that much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The money needs a big topic.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
And now there's a problem with the behavior of people against Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible for me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-muslim neighbor started to look at me through his fingers just because I'm a Muslim.
It's like I'm evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you just choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work, basically anywhere else, and I ran into a free place at Air France here in Prague.
I'll admit I didn't know from the beginning of Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, Dad even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially for a whole different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or abuses, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress up, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone's still looking at you uncomfortablely, like when you have special clothes and something like that.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
I don't think the Praguemen care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After a job in Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then one friend and I started websites on which people are offering and looking for shared housing.
So far, we're only in Prague, but we'd like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two Czech friends.
I have to say, another specimen of Bohemia is that he's holding his distance more at first.
They're not letting someone get to their body right away.
That's quite a difference from where I grew up.
On the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the face.
This is different, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it's pretty simple in Prague, because maybe everyone here speaks English.
Even at night or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have enough time.
And by making at least a little communication in English, I don't have the need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met any negative reactions?
Like you're a Muslim?
Basically, no.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience I can think of.
My manager, Czechka, once told me about the French football team, and she told me something in the sense of, "It's not French, but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone has a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, they're gonna put me there.
Protimuslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen even in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
I may not have been able to imagine something like this would happen in France until now.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognise violence at all.
For me, people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel that when terrorists snatch your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel bad and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I'm trying not to follow the violence report much, but every time I read something, I have to apologize for something that's not actually my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří's Square of Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims demonstrated violence with Christians.
Have you registered this?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty about something they didn't do?
Are you meeting in Prague with other Muslims?
My associates are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than me, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam because we all feel it a little different.
I'm from France, so I went through another education, and they may have learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes connect to the subordinate position of a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't think I'm the subject in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It also depends on the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
Like hijab?
And he's signing on the most important way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a really basic Muslim.
He's praying five times a day, but he just doesn't wear scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone who interprets it.
When you read the Quran, you should make your own opinion on these things.
So when I read the passage in the Quran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought, "I am not the prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves require, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else I felt so good.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but in Prague, I feel great.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for me.
Czech Muslims demonstrated violence with Christians.
The Yachtress of Kozel Fencl wind in Ria was enrolled in the processors.
Friday's ride to the sea in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero came out Czech yachts Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In Laser Radial class, she moved before the final two rides to the tenth place.
That would ensure the Czech Republic's participation in the final ride.
You'll collect the packages as pokemons.
They want to compete with carriers.
For the idea of using already scheduled delivery routes, TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger stands.
With the idea, the life of the three applications with a different geographical range.
In May, we launched the national application of the Transfer.
At this point, there are thousands of cities in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic we first want to learn this before we focus even abroad, he says in an interview for iDNES.cz one-four-year-old manager.
How will I take over and who can benefit from it?
You'll download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data how big the package you can transfer and how much you want.
Someone's gonna be demanding transport again that day.
When the route and the delivery time fits, it binds, and it comes together.
At that point, a chat opens where a couple arrange a handover.
How many people you think would have to register to always find their courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads it is necessary to cover the coverage completely optimum and each offer is linked to demand.
The main moves are already working, and it's logically easier than on the way between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential of speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building their trust and finding out that no one is going to run with the package.
Haven't you had a case like this yet?
How many users have a service after two months after starting?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6,000 people who make paths.
We consider that a success, and we believe that others will be packed.
Doesn't it threaten to wait too long for the consignee?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates because we are able to deliver the thing, perhaps the same day and at a fraction of the price.
For a large company for delivery within two hours, you will pay a few thousand.
You're gonna pay a hundred or less here because that's the way someone's already taking.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about possible customer incapacitation to the future?
We hope so.
The market has enormous potential, there are large transnational carriers here, as well as business chains where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality is not responsible for what they pay.
No one wants to find a ticket in the mailbox with a message that he's supposed to pick up a shipment on the branch, first that day after 19:00.
At the time, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't be shaking anyone and sends out a competitive signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a TV director.
In 2014, they began to prepare the application of Shippansee LTD, which is used to transport packages already scheduled roads between the world metropolitans, especially a plane.
In 2015, they entered a project for the processing of a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of the year and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
The appliance started to develop in December last year and released this May.
This is a local version of Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
The Messiah and Messiah Profi have developed applications since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these applications from the beginning, which will be connected one day at one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to reconcile the application, and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, they want to focus more on the global market.
The shared economy is recently a theme and this is AirBnB or Uber service.
Don't you worry about the action in the area that no one can tell much about so far where is the sharing boundaries and where the grey economy?
It's the same, just another product.
We're aware that if it's a success and we'll go up with it, we'll be the next thorn in the eye through the gray economy.
But although someone saves and someone earns, there is no intention of circumventing the financial authorities and tax controls.
Any user, on either side or on the other hand, will be encouraged to pay his income if he makes it.
What do you think the service has so much potential?
The addressee will save and carry out a profit, respectably reduce the cost of the journey.
That's the strong idea that combines interest on both sides.
In the times of social networks that people divide, we would like this one to convergence.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone and to talk about it.
Maybe someone's gonna bring you the forgotten glasses, the keys or the pills.
People in my opinion have long been missing a personal approach, we say this application is the service of people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package won't run away?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans a civil card and indicates a bank connection, a payment or a credit card.
These are channels that give the service and the human credibility.
Couriers also collect stars on the basis of the evaluation of consignors.
We'll also offer insurance, we're still looking at the details.
In case of loss or damage, the courier shall not take responsibility for content under criminal law if there is something illegal and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and finds him in a closed package in his suitcase, or 10 kilos of firearms, the criminal responsibility of the consignee.
Doesn't it threaten the use of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, a supervised administrative authority that will be the only one able to look into it, and we cannot see them ourselves, data are protected against abuse.
How much money will he get after successful delivery of the shipment into the courier's hand?
The courier determines the price and gets the whole amount he asks about.
Subsectors shall be charged a few percent extra for intermediation.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent because we want to push to the volume.
Also, no one can accuse the shipment when he actually delivered it, taking over, and delivery is checked with QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a salary egg and big as a bass of beer.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if someone has a seat in the car, he'll take a refrigerator.
Plus, the transmitter has a chance to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack it if you don't want to hide the contents.
You put the courier in your hand forgotten sweatshirt and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long it took to run the service?
A friend got the idea over two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention.
Then he showed me the demo of the application with the transnational range, which aims mainly at the passenger plane.
At the moment, I told him I wouldn't be looking for a investor, but I would like to become it myself and put savings in it.
The next year it lasted for developments than for the more cost-effectiveness of the product to be founded in London by Shippansee LTD.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we've focused on the Czech Republic, where we're trying to adapt the application, because it's all having birth pain and there's still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market is not so much dealt with at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we don't want to, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were their way of upgrade.
I'll take over when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that at least we'll learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of Messíkem is local, for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address to the other end of the world.
It works for consignors as well as I take over, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your phone.
The application for couriers who want to live with it is called the Messiah Profi.
So someone can get used to picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will download in Prague, like a taxi driver, a student, a mother on a parental vacation, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
As much as everybody's stupid with the scattered, they can collect this exactly the same thing.
You see where there are orders around town, it comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transported.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still doing a web interface that will be harder for companies to send consignments on the web will fill out the data on them, or create points on the map.
We are then able to use their service, for example, to facture each month.
Are you taking full time on the project now?
It makes us tough, but we've got it normally at work so that we can use the project and develop it.
We don't hide behind us a strong transnational investor, we're two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other jumped into it with other initiatives and ideas.
Now we're looking for a investor strong enough to manage to seal with us not the Czech market, but to go with us to the world's product and become another huge market player like AirBnB and Uber.
Story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be more fragile than in Call of Duty's first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of the first part of the network.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility to use the fight titanium.
In addition to action passages, the game will include levels that are focused on acute movement.
They'll remind you of the platforms and include the rébuses.
Therefore, they are essential to buy double jumps, running through walls and rope slopes.
In addition, sometimes enemies will have to be disposed of.
There will be no maps missing reminiscent of the maze and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift the platforms and close the massive doors.
That's how you'll be adjusting the shape of the battlefield.
The tempo of the game should be able to scal between angry events and quieter moments to explore the unknown planet.
We're gonna play for Jack Cooper's pawn to dream about the pilot's career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimosa, is breaking down on the extraterrestrial planet Typhon, which is the hostile soldiers.
And there won't be a wilderness to him.
In addition, the lastimos in the crash will endure the fatal wounds, and so Cooper will be given the task of operating the captain's titanium.
His dream of a pilot's career will be fulfilled before he expected to.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's titanium calls will be important.
Players will serve as a source of information about the military history, but at the same time, robotic isolated communications will create funny moments.
For example, when the titanium is to remove all the injuries that threaten Cooper in the scheduled jump.
First information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions from the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark will live, but the original publisher remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes the name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ publishing in 2013, she gained a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and name of the company.
For example, Nordic released the Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, there are 23 more games for the publisher and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found her 20 years younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first, apparently, she tried it for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she was dating like that in front of me.
She's completely out of her mind.
In the first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girl's love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denyed it.
But I've been watching it all.
He went out of work regularly at 4:30, so she always left at 3 purchasing.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
Later, I figured they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were there.
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, after all, I've always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, make the decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife was mentally controlling me.
Soon I think she found out that I'm in charge of doing what she wants.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a mess.
At that time, the neighbors suggested that he knew about it.
I was such a jerk I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it'd be bad.
Only a daughter suspected that it would come to everyone in the family.
So I always put it down, keep going, keep going.
But once I went to his apartment, and I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got an anonymous, that he was dating my wife, and that he suggests it all.
I asked him what he'd tell me.
He stood there, he crawled his shoulders, looked into the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife once on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't say anything to me either.
No one told me anything then.
I'm the kind of person who's never dated a lot, who's got a problem meeting someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was still counting on the fact that one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her for everything, and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I didn't really deal with it.
I've got it in me today.
I used to show her that pretty often, but I finally left it for a while.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housekeeper.
She's always done everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's working.
I think she's always been trying to make me have no other reason to complain.
And you can say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to rub her, hug her, and she won't.
We're walking and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we're having.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she liked me and me, but she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him today, he's her god.
And I don't like that life.
When it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I had ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her, yes or no.
But she thought, and she said, "But there's plenty."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists and calling the government and the local Muslim minority to help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, France will continue to guarantee the freedom of their religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France preaches in the country.
He also wants to stop financing a mosque from abroad, when preachers often come with money with a jihad vaccination.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
She had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, the inner riots affected her, and that's why she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
The new foundation is likely to become the former Minister of Interior and Defense of Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as the supporter of the secular state.
In France there are approximately 2500 mosques and prayers, about 120 of which serve radical islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clergymen and consider this step in several other tens.
This week, the German police also hit the Jihadist spiritual police.
Immamates reportedly recruited the fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized themselves and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on the new institution, which replaces the non-functional foundation, began in France.
All of them have accelerated other terrorist attacks that were carried out by radical Islamic Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new Foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of the mosque from home resources and also to supervise imámas.
However, it is not yet clear where it will get finances, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for the halal food, i.e. mainly for meat resulting from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by the vendors of halal food for granting a permit.
A part of the money would go to the budget of the Foundation.
Contributions of EUR 10 to EUR 20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mexico.
Every year, the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia is about 30,000 out of France.
In the French mosques, only preachers who went through educational programmes at the university.
As a result, their preaching should be in accordance with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December, and others will follow," said the Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve.
"In France, there is no place for those who spell hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife has severely hurt the unsub shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in the North-Spanish Zaragoza, writes an Independent journal.
There was a shooting after the wife and daughter left the garage space in their car.
A man was waiting in a car before the shopping center, from where he started shooting.
According to witnesses, a man then turned a gun against himself, writes an Independent.
The woman took an uninjured daughter to the hospital, for a man in critical condition, she had to come an ambulance.
There was an act about 9/11 in the central part of the metropolitan autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was likely to be the unsolved divorce of both partners.
Champagne valves, algae waffles, ginger and chili sauce.
This summer wishes light, well-fooded meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens smells of grilled neck, bump, pork cologne.
Nothing very healthy, nothing too light, sometimes except salad or baked vegetables.
True, the barbecue is time-saving, and the dishes, and it's a social thing, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to make good delicacies that have a special tablemaking, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke.
And they're going to contribute to our health.
Whether it takes domestic sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-armed grifs are sufficient to prepare the entertainment and food itself a real exotic delicacie.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Even more timely cooking and cooling of rice falls off here.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it only depends on the fantasies of the cook, how he intends to play with the fillets and accessories.
It's not algae.
The advantage of a range of Asian cuisine dishes today is that raw materials are generally available.
Including a loaded sweetening ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharpness and also delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it mixes from several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag corresponding to the size, and the annex with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is finished.
Banana leaves.
In particular, they are used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes in various ceremony opportunities and rituals.
Long ribed banana leaves are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America as well as "helps" to prepare various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed similarly as in alobal.
Then the Banana leaves the food to pass a special flavor.
We can buy in shops with exotic fruits and vegetables, even in advance cut into shape.
But choose only leaves of green, and therefore healthy, unbreaked and without stain.
Similarly, the preparation of salad from wacam algae, sesame and sesame oil is easy.
It can be bought freezing again.
Who often prepares her or prepares sushi will probably know the algae of the nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of sea algae from which it is produced by scrubbing, pressing and drying of the so-called nourish list − scaffolds intended for the manufacture of sushi.
Wakame – dark green algae growing in waters around the island of Hokkaidó – it is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the algae of the nori.
By the way, who doesn't know the wakame soup, allegedly Asian women use it for recovery after birth.
And at all, this algae has almost magical effects.
It cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents hair loss and is literally loaded with mineral substances.
The dried and broken wacam also serves as spices, for example to taste the rice.
Fresh algae first let out in the water, then flush, insert into boiling water and half minutes cook.
Afterwards, it cools in ice water, cuts down the middle ribs and continues to be modified, such as popular salad.
But buying it already finished, frozen, is the simplest solution.
So it's just left to wipe the roll with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and don't throw a barbecue.
To eat healthy, light and summer.
Asian people know how to do that.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skillfulness, and you have interesting fresh food that combines delicious taste.
And it's done once.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white strawberries, 100 g of green christmas, 60 g salad cucumber, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g sweet chili sauce.
Hrst of coriander, spoon of black sesame, spoon of criracha chili sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g of ginger loaded gari, a bit of pine nuts.
First, we'll get our threads ready.
We'll wet the rice paper for five seconds into cold water.
Then we'll take it out and wait for him to soften.
Meanwhile, in hot water, we'll have a short cooking of cramps, we'll make them cool quickly in ice water so that they don't lose the color.
We'll put a vegetable fill on the permissible paper and wrap it up.
We will prepare the filling of white strawberries, carrots and salad cucumbers that we cut on fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add the cut coriander, mix thoroughly and put them on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we put the brick outlets, add the threads and finish the whole meal with the wakame algae, the ginger, the mango slice, the black sesame and add some pine nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in the seventh rugby, Fiji's selection takes gold
The impressive performance of the Great Britain in the seventh ragby ended with a destructive lead on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night the British at the Deodoro stadium here in Riu high 43:7.
The Fijis have demonstrated master lessons in processing, landfills, defects, support games, running on lava and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unpredictable price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for the UK on the third day - and the British could be at their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seventh ragby proud, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The dried win over South Africaans 7:5 in the semifinals the same day, maybe it's dead in the final.
Fiji, however, would also defeat a 15-member team in full health in its form.
You're not going to be comforting for the British, but they can rejoice for at least one of them having a gold medal around the neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain's offended a lot of roads.
Eight years ago under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match at Adelaide Sevens.
They lost one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is inspirable.
Fiji began greatly, the British passages reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running on a row of buses in motion and champions of the world cup led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau was out from behind the corner.
The timemere showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added more down on the right wing from which the conversation was.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the great Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scoreing the third time, but only Fidžans slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua put the touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after his return, and in the hours there was still more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then penetrated through the tiny Brits and bounced into the lamb where he scored.
After the conversation to the 29:0 state, there was a break.
It was like Fiji for ragby 7s was born while the British were still learning how to pass.
That's exactly how it is.
The British, half-time, made mass changes and the Fidžan's support, stopped... for a long four minutes, which compared to the first half time, was good until after the Brilliant interplay of Fiji Josu Tuis.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, thrown a touchdown in the left corner to increase an 36:7. The game has already won the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans on the hills singing, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the totally joyful approach of the Fijians.
At the end of the moments, Mata Viliam was further attempted to conquer the Fijians.
The whistle came in, the Fijis hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely boiled.
Even before that same day Fiji in the semifinal defeated Japan 20:5 and the United Kingdom conquered the South Africa Republic in a tight semifinal - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the time to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his shining leg work, ran through the defense line and scored in the second half of the hook.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's 15th team, made a victory and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight of a cancer coach
You can't find more emotional gold on these games, and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 penitential blows into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found more meaning at their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though the two of them were sitting at the wedding, the three votes were in the ship, when the ship was drained up at the level by the second Olympic gold behind them in the race of female pairs, there was still the voice of coach Robin Williams in the ship, and they were the first women in the history of British sport that achieved such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unbearable.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as after the water level flys with elegance swans - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
Every gold medal from the village is a battalion of helpful hands, which a bit after a piece mean a difference, and no hands were helped more than the hands of a coach who didn't know if he was going to live this day when he was found cancer.
According to his words, it was insecure.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated, and I have undergone this operation.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's kind of gonna change your view of the thing.
The cancer was found to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio, he could have taken treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and thus cut the blackout to a minimum - if that's what we can call it in these circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That was an inspiration.
I was in the hospital and I walked in the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said it was enough.
That's how it started.
It's the way to hang in itself, but this was a little more difficult.
Right after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual, trying to handle his own rest.
Stanning, Captain of the Royal Artillery, who has a mission in Afghanistan, said: “I have been with emotions on the bottom this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it emphasizes how much this means for me how much Helen and I worked with and Robin.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be nobody, so he belongs to him a huge thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better man to practice or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose one race in five years.
The two put a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't compensate.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crew from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very big reserve.
We focused at the point at the very moment.
Helen screamed, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to make a good speech, go out and win the race, which we did.
Doubles take a year to think before they decide what happens next.
Glover's getting married next week, she's a television friend Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was in so much stress.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about it," she said.

Prison?
It's more like driving free people, saying a taxiimapia Rubeš to a break-up prosecution.
Six taxi drivers and former headquarters in Prague are, as ČT said, accused.
You have filmed a number of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices and those who are to be in a group that will be in court.
You faced some unpleasant fights with exposed actors.
How much is the report on the accused of the members of the organized group a breakthrough for you?
I was expecting a trial to happen.
I'm particularly curious about the judgment.
But I don't think they should be in prison.
That's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all the people for free.
That's somewhat selfish solution.
Does this mean that you do not consider any punishment sufficiently effective?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a ring, another scatters a pizza, and one totally screwed up.
The defendants may, in theory, get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with the detention of freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Close someone in prison, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the company they took from her.
For the fourth century they committed to destroying our country's name and robbing people.
So let them do a good card right now and distribute people for free.
I can't imagine anything else.
It would work like a publicly beneficial job.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they'd get a car and they'd drive people in Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get a condition in the end and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and then at Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
It belongs to people in the Czech Republic who began with viral videos and videos directly for the website.
He works as an editor for the Stream.cz Internet TV, where he participates in a series of shows, now prepares Prague Guide, which is primarily dedicated to foreign viewers.
In short reports, Rubes advises what services I prefer to avoid in Prague and what it recommends to use without worry.
Previously he recorded series with names How to do this, City of fraud?, Life in luxury, And enough! and Prague vs. Prachy.
In the prosecution, they're referred to as a organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of underwater taxi drivers be called Mafia?
They're the cute mafias, not the ones we know from Godfather.
It's more like mafia - juniors, but they're definitely organized.
It's just that they're watching each other's staff (taxical stations).
Prague is scattered.
I traced that, for example, the main station doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone just keeps guarding their place, and each group is somehow organized.
It's probably a confusing network.
The defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate officer who warned the driver against control.
As you say yourself, the unwanted phenomenon of the streets did not disappear.
What percentage of Prague fraud in the taxi according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst guys on the street are still.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryyak.
It's a person who's really dangerous - in his car, he's got a telescopic booth, and every Friday and Saturday stands at Karl's bridge and driven people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me seven hundred in three miles.
His police didn't stop for a reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
However, the same situation is also in other places of Prague.
Thus, by prosecuting seven people, it is hard to erase the famous Prague polluter, which apparently has much greater dimensions.
Of course, it's no use.
It'll help, but it's not all evil that's going to wash, it's true.
Are taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still in the same places you showed up in the news, by Karl's bridge or in the Paris street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations stand every day and break every day the decrees.
It's ignoring both city police and Prague magistrate.
It's not even a blanket anymore, but a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet, some of them, even if it's only part of the group, will get before trial.
It's been a breakthrough.
I therefore have to ask, do you feel delighted?
If I took it as a merit, it would be bad, because my goal was, it is, and it will always be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it's a little better, I'll keep going.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get him removed.
You can't be happy with that.
But it's not like that, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxi?
Sometimes I run a test drive and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, but then claimed that it was 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal line).
He had a receipt, the police arrived, and this taxi driver was so cute that he still went to those cops and asked them when someone would finally give him 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver overlooked the 10th line and robbed tourists by 357 crowns.
Can you say that the viciousness of fraudulent taxi drivers did not step down after you showed the faces of those who charged nonsense amounts for a short drive?
Their disgustingness is still incredible.
How did the taxi driver get to 56 crowns?
The police sent him away with the fact that they couldn't discuss with him on the spot because he put on the bill.
And that will be, I think, a problem with the court, too.
On the one hand, there's gonna be a taxi driver with his bills on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from the taxi vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the pieces of their fraud, the taxi drivers pointed me into this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage for a story.
Are you worried that this fact might also protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive six or ten crowns per kilometer because he wouldn't have used it.
You were talking about a trick with a decimal line, which, especially before foreign clients, underwater taxi drivers move.
Is it still up to date, or are they concerned about this fig after the publication of your reporters continue to use?
I think we've been populizing this trick by sending out the show.
I recently went with a taxi driver, and he praised in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that from the side of the cabametre accelerated with a black sticker.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taxi drivers didn't work too much, can they warnly impress court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can discourage them from fraud?
You've talked about how you think they're going to cheat, they'll always find it.
I don't think we can distract them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And they're fair taxi drivers who should fight more for getting them out of there.
From my experience, I must say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague are, fortunately, prevailing.
But do they want to go against those who spoil their reputation?
They have a taste, but they're missing an um.
She doesn't know much about it, and she can't exactly say what she wants.
When they organized this demonstration (as a proposal for a total limitation from the office of Prime Minister Adriana Krnáčová), it did not seem very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they didn't protest against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It just happened that they blocked Prague and made it the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you overall assess the approach of the Prague Master in addressing the problem of pre-suicide?
It's obvious that she had to go into this until the C.P.D. to solve something.
The magistrate was short for it.
They had a mole that had the information, which means that the taxi department has done their work for several years completely unnecessarily.
I hope they'll charge the official to the last check of all the frozen checks to realize what he's done.
That's the worst part.
I was even on one control ride with him, which I found out from their schedule.
It's been a few months since the last series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially with foreign viewers than actually the series is the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'm letting them have the videos.
And then when we're going to the Old Town Square, they're surprised to see the same people on the footage, they're really standing.
Unfamously famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd build a slice around them to make people look at them.
The Communism Museum right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a cab if you need it?
Sure.
I'm riding services that I don't have to pay cash but a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispensers that are fair.
I only took a taxi on the street once since.
The driver said to me when I got into the car, "Taa, you have the courage."
Bem in the dressing for Italian tourists.
The underlying practice of taxi drivers has been written in 2005.
In the same year, the primator Paul Beem went out on a control ride in the Italian tourist dressing and at the first attempt the driver deceived it by two hundred.
The editor Rubes had worse experiences.
The taxi drivers charged him for a ride from the Old Town Square of 820 crowns, which is about 195 crowns per kilometre, as the writers calculated.
At the same time, the Prague magistrate set the maximum price for 28 crowns per kilometre.
In filmed reports there are also other surprising sums: for example a two-km road from the Paris street to Truhlář stood a tourist of 400 crowns.
They also provided a taxi drivers waiting at Karl's bridge.
On the ride to the Angel, which is 2,5 kilometers, they charge six hundred crowns.
The marble is mostly washed with pure water, the most without chemistry and the longer it is, the better.
The impurities go well out of it, although sometimes the dirt must be cast down by scalpel, it must be removed from the corners.
It's not easy, and it can't be fast, she's approaching her work by restaurant Vanesa Trost from Oldřichov in Háj.
A hat down before it: the tomb is built by scaffolding, after which you have to climb in countless times and back down.
"Restaurator should be careful, patient and unfavourable on the work environment," she said.
It's not far from her first restaurant work in Frýdlant.
Thanks to it, there were renewals, for example, of the stone elements of the facade in the back tract of the French City Hall, also restauranted statues of St. Maří Magdaleny in Zátiší, St. Jan Nepomucký in Frýdlanta, Pietu in the French Okružní Street, the Mariánský column in Frýdlant or atlanta in the foreseeable spa in New Town under Smrk.
With the renewal of Melchior's tombstone, Kryštof and Katerina from Redern, it began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the impurities and crust, the released stone parts are ensured against fall and shift; they will either be boiled into the wall or to each other.
They are also being treated and preserved.
The descriptions on the tomb will be sent over again.
"Then it begins with a glaze on marble plates with gold," said the referent of the State monumental care of the city office in Frýdlant Věra Sobotová.
There's no record of the tombs going through some repairs.
On a closer look, they take holes, spilled in marble columnh.
It's hundreds of years old, and it's the remains of the graveyard decoration.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish arrival in the 30-year war, everything disappeared.
Literally, the tombs were hairy, noted Saturday.
In the church finding the Holy Cross there are restaurants with a mild highsight like home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombs that came underwater, the baptist, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to enter the witch in the future," said Saturday.
The church is in very good condition, we put money in maintenance and repairs every year.
The restoration work on renewal of the redervian tomb will come to a total of 128,000 crowns.
They will be paid from the subsidy, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of recovery.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from the winning in the regional round of the competition Historic City of 2015, the remaining 28,000 crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, specifying the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
On the release of the prize for the restoration of the tomb, the representative decided.
Experts' views on future developments on selected foreign markets followed by indices and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) at the horizon of one month and a half years.
In the markets there is low volatility and growth.
Who else would have said that at the beginning of the year.
The US S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the correction in February, is today on a new historical maxim and has already added 7 percent from the beginning of the year.
This is again confirmed by the Iron Rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which have always achieved their own.
In a situation where the US shares on the historical maxim are again disappearing volatility, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets were satisfied and fearlessly grown thanks to the quantitative release of the American Central Bank and when, as well as today, the volatility index (VIX) kept stable below the 12 percent.
And so don't.
Although the Fed markets continue to prepare for gradual increases in interest rates, quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full stream and in the past week the Bank of England has also added its hand to the work, which will purchase bonds of £70 billion in the coming six months.
The new wave of quantitative release therefore pushes so low yields even below and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risks and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
Of course, that's a question for a million.
However, there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without greater fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and the situation in China is stabilized, and Brexit is no longer a theme, so we probably shouldn't be too surprised if in a similar calm regime the US shares continue.
Too bad Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted to do this difficult work of the Experienced Policy, declared the head of the European Commission Juncker, when the French politician (experienced, since the most various transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) appointed by the European Commission's main negotiator the conditions of leaving the Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's choice has blown out the hope that it is in the serious interest of the EU to look for a form of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most of the British media accepted Barnier's name as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As a European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He took her the way he could only capture her: a hard enemy of anglosa's concept of free market and a model of capitalism.
The inter-author of the concept of the banking union was a co-author of the concept of the banking union and will benefit from everything from the London Financial Centre, City, which has established the legislation of the overwhelming financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the Paris representative in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable and apparently irresponsible negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, as not to remember the peaceful and friendly distribution of the Czechoslovak Federation, which has contributed so much to the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
Even so today, Czechs and Slovers can be the closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus at least in this one.
It'd be good for everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Lord of Kremla has released his loved Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the position of the president's office.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
She informed the Russian media of the appeal to Kremla's press release.
Putin indicated that Ivanov was released at his own request.
During the meeting, which was transferred by the Rossija 24 television station, the president said that it was going to be at the request of Ivan's proclaimed to be the head of the President's office for up to four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The report on the exchange in the President's head of the administration, which is now led by Ivanov's current representative of Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is referred to as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former officer of the KGB in the past, for example, was appointed Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the Government.
Now, the chair of the President's Security Council is leaving.
However, Ivanov, when meeting Putin, said that he was actually a recordman in the head of the state's administration.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that, in 25 years of its establishment, 11 people had already been set up in this function.
It's not like a flower or a fanny uncle and she's not playing the finals.
So far, neither of the fifth tennis matches has been able to transform into a final partition.
Petra Kvitová, who was the first to lose her fight, under the portoric surprise of Monica Puig after the hundreds of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech Waffler and Strýce were followed.
The Slayers of the Sisters Williams, though in the first set, wasted by two hundred balls, and the Russians, at the end, had won a set in a short game.
The second set then lost at 4:6.
Half-time success in the morning program in Riu recorded Czech veslation: skifarer Ondřej Synek with an overview won his semifinals when the other Damira Martin from Croatia beat even through the liberation in the conclusion of almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, said Son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for the procedure.
So some power took them off, that might make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing cards for me, the verb of Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková didn't walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The five-year-old semifinals have settled the fourth position in their ride today, and it is expected to start in the B final and fight by 7 to 12th place on Saturday.
London's gold doesn't go for it.
I didn't go to the final for the first time in the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a high-quality race, and I put everything I could do.
The rivals were just better, the Topinková Knapková bounced in front of them.
She fought until the end, and she believed she'd get to her fourth game between elite six.
The fight gave up just before the target.
I knew that the girls were balanced that anyone could step out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had that final.
And I thought I could move through the Rakusanka in the finals.
Unfortunately, today, the race took place, said to the champion of the world from 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Riu remained a young shooter Filip Nepeakchal, who, for the second time, was unable to break out of qualifications, this time, a small league in a lie.
He took 33th place in it.
Qualification was best done to the Russians.
Sergei Kamenski with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
The bullet was 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes spoke to the program in Ria, including Czech seven fighters Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Keyinová.
Cachová belongs after the second discipline of the Olympic competition eleventh place, the Czech recorderka Eliška Keyinová is twenty-fourth.
She leads Britka Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to an altitude of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both were committed to the historically best height performance within the seven-bitch.
They were still trying to jump 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look away from absurdity, the questions asked this way: the German society has been deeply self-reflexed, but not Russian.
In both the great european nations there were dictators in the 20th century, and the power of regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible.
The Russian Bolsheviks, from 1917 to 1989, contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism, which says the Black Paper of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted famine, incompetent leadership of war or inhuman experiments.
In a non-human way, the Nazis have exterminated about 6 million Jews and the total victims of the Second World War are estimated to be 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets performed the wilderness.
In Germany and the SSSR there were no blame for just a few individuals, but a large part of the nation took part in these crimes either actively, passively or only by being cowardly or squeezing their heads into the sand.
This is not only the specificities of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the declaration was immediately terminated, the Norimber tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the kids grew up, they started asking, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you take part in such an animal?
How could you!
This brought real reflexes and cures to society.
Germany’s elites have recently taken care of the prosperity of the country, the removal of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (sometimes naive idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to join Alsasko-Lotrino or someone - to revanš - military attack - perhaps everyone will.
There was no great reflex after the cold war in Russia.
The window of possible positive changes was ultimately closed at the turn of the Millennium when the former officer of KGB (sic!)Vladimír Putin reached power.
Many crimes are celebrated in Russia today.
The Politics of the Putinov Russia is a revanš, conquering the lost territories, humiliating the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of its own people is no value for the faithful.
Fight yours, and strangers will fear.
I still believe that this is just those decades of the despotical regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valuable - predetermined for Asian (sebe) tyranny.
Who's benefiting from the growth of the tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border has been deteriorated.
Who benefits the tension growth?
After a longer period of relative peace, there was again another deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian Party was the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both distressed parties are contradictory and it is difficult to verify independently, so we can only think about the old known question to whom does this benefit?
According to the reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crime from the Ukrainian Party, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and contradicts the Kreml of provokation.
Information on arrests of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already come from the Savčenkové pilot case known to answer that they were allegedly abducted in Russia.
If we joined the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is, nothing.
The escalation of the tension around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further strengthening sanctions and strengthening the anti-Roman campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe took a retreat from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost credit in front of its residents when the current support of President Porošnek is about 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have bankrupt long ago not to be generous financial injections by the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw close attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before the voter in its country.
President Porošenko and other members of the management of the forces want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to face even the great Russia.
It is not left to hope that all those who try to develop an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will ultimately inform their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers but all the ordinary people on both distressed parties and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (from June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when the positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, in the last 12 months (September 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (September 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
Consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, and the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the routes of these groups of consumer goods was recorded: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 %), transport (1.8 %), culture and recreation (6.3 %), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), other goods and services (0.3 %).
The price decreased in clothing and footwear (2,2 %), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0,5 %), health (0,1 %).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained in alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. Secret Services reportedly followed the Russian hacking attacks.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Investigation Office (FBI) announced that it was involved in attacking the Democratic Party headquarters servers.
However, no official report mentions the Russian involvement of the attack.
The Mosque share of the attack denied.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, because it would reveal that the US secret hacker's attack was monitoring and revealed to be the way they do it and what sources they use.
It says that two Russian intelligence services participated in the attack.
New cyber-security advisory board
The Russian trace tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight leading Members of Congress was informed of public agents, called the 8th gang in the USA.
It is formed by the heads of the two chambers of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, President of the Democrats in both chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congress gate and security committees.
The President of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazile, announced on Thursday that she was creating a cyber-security consultancy corpse to "protect future attacks and secure the first-class protection of the Democratic Party servers".
He was a dangerous parasite in a smoked salmon of Albert.
Apologizing.
Based on the consumer's initiative on health problems after food consumption Losos wild smoked - bits 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 Prague hygienist carried out inspections in Albert's shops in the Václav Square and the Bridge.
The check found that the L23012562/T4 batch with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer had no longer been aware of, and therefore the product was taken from the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
Laboratory examination was confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of sea mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvaes in the body cavity or the muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and a person greased alive larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, pointed Shish.
We very much apologize to customers for the problems of this branding product.
We have immediately withdrawn the batch mentioned from the sale and for preventive reasons we have withdrawn all the other batches of this item.
The doubt was made on the supplier's side, and at the same time we had this product tested, said to the News spokesman Albert Barbora Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chain shops and get the money back.
The Larva will destroy the freezing and sufficient heat adjustment
The seller was Nekton - Vrňata.
The hygienist informed Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration of the presence of dangerous products.
According to the server, the safety of food.cz people may get ill after the parasite get sick by anisakiosis, which will show prudent abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or disease may occur unprecedentedly, said ČTK.
Symptoms will be available for an hour to two weeks after the consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of the larva disease, usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either in sufficient heat treatment of fish meat, or in freezing them.
The veterinarians have now examined the salmon and the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples had parasites in them.
The shipment came to the Czech Republic in accordance with the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expeded, in most of the Ahold chain, was 919 packages today.
At the present time, a download of the sold stock of the product from the salesmen, said the spokesman of the SVS Petr Pejchal on Friday.
The veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
The seventeen-year-old Britka wanted to run out of Rakka, killed her, apparently Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage with a jihadist who was killed, there was a sobriety.
The expected paradise of the chalíphate turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima, according to her relatives.
She called her to Britain repeatedly and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape from Alcatraza.
They have an order without reason to shoot, quote the Telegraph of the family's deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks were led to Rakka, the last time the girl heard from there.
Then she just came up with a message of her death, which can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from the apartment in East London.
Together, they were discussing how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped they'd meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house in which she stayed was compared to the land of attack, said the British ITV News.
Television said that the bomb probably dropped a Russian plane that attacked the IS basin in Syria.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your baby out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the lawyer of the family.
A week when (Kadiza) thought of escape from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakusanka was caught in attempt to escape, and according to the information available, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think it's a warning for Kadiza, and she decided not to risk it, it's BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amira Abas went on the road on the 17th February of last year.
They just said they were going out at home.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey on the territory controlled by the IS.
The girl's family according to the lawyer did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You'd endure blue from heaven just to get your baby out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could to get all the strengths to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking being caught, he added a lawyer.
The only positive thing he believes is that Kadiza's fate can serve as a disgusting case for other girls or boys who are going to be fooled by islamistic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, they realized how things were going there, they understood how far it differs from the promises of the Islamic State, and they wanted to come back," said Akunjee.
The fate of Kadizi's classmate is not known.
But since they also shut down, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing crime.
For centuries, the village of Inveraray was a county center and the duke of Argyll.
Since the mid-18th century, courts and basement have been served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners were inhabited were pathetic and many prisoners tried to escape.
Plenty of them and success.
That is why the city's representatives decided to move the prison space to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and it was much more favourable to prisoners, having heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it has not been in operation for a long time, it has already been concluded for economic reasons by the end of August 1889, since the smaller repair facilities have been costly for operation and have not been paid too much.
The stories of criminals and the hunt for spirits.
For the public, the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with a new one to convince themselves of the different conditions in them.
The guides in the time costumes are still making authentic experiences.
The vision is also a torture room in which visitors can know what forms of punishment they used on a criminal, whether it was the breaking of fingers or burning marks on the body.
In the framework of the tour, tourists can be locked into one of the cells, mostly because of a photograph of a monument, or to create a feeling that prisoners are living behind bars.
Moreover, Inveraray is one of the most famous Scottish sites, where he allegedly scares.
There have been several groups of paranormal activities, and today the museum allows people to come hunting spirits.
Such a night, however, is going to be 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
Apart from this popular tourist attraction also attracts great food, surrounding panoramata and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animous, but some observers say he is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat application allows about 150 million users to change reality and mess with the identity of ways that limit with absurdity.
You can make a pineapple, a dog or a character out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million upgraded selfies every day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
Snapchat's filters in the past have earned criticism with accusations that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports white shades of the skin as the ideal of beauty.
So, when this week the users offered a filter that made their eyes shiny, broken teeth and blown faces, some critics pointed it out as a racist cartoon of the Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated questions did not point to the greater problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and enragement quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day he cancelled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended to show the accounts to anime figures, not as carticature of the Asian characters.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
The others have refused comparisons to the animians without packaging.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea, whose tweet of photographs was widely shared, said in e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparison of the obvious Asian caricature and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about yellow faces (yellowface), but that the yellow face is dragged into contemptive extremity.
Snapchat is not the only company that crossed these cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusions, from the sittings in corporations to Holywood and the equipment we all wear in our hand.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive for some users," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhua on Thursday in the interview, "It is very difficult to go around these things today without notice, as it was before."
Katie Zhua, product manager and designer who works for Medium decided to delete her account on Thursday on Snapchat and invited the others to do the same.
In the article for the Medium and in the interview on the phone, she stated that it is convinced that ras-motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the prevailing white, totally male company leadership, and the article ended with hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It is either that they have no diversity among employees and colorful people at the time they decide about these things,” Zhuová said, “or there are bare people working, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk.”
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left to a large extent without answer.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees, with a statute for private companies.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the race of its employees, but according to the spokesman, the company recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on the insufficiently represented population and the internal inclusive management.
Zhua adds: “I am curious if they really need other such users who can say that it is not okay,” the fact that their account will remain cancelled.
The military officers distorted the IS intelligence information, says the parliamentary committee
The Parliamentary Committee in the report published on Thursday, stated that officers from the Central Headquarters of the United States changed the reporting services to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events they provided from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the working group, drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the rapporteur Committee and the Defence Subcommittee Committee, there was a ‘experienced dissatisfactory’ among the analysts of the Central Reporting Service, according to which their supervisors changed their efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central headquarters, known as CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, which supervises American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The approaches of intelligence services approved by the Centcom officers usually offered a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than the facts on the earth have been confirmed and were consistently more positive than the analysis obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Cencom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when the policymakers are presented to the politician's superiors with a wrong analysis," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
A failure in the headquarters of Centom reaches the top of the organization.
The decade report describes the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in detail in describing and analysing the efforts of American forces in Iran in 2014 and 2015.
Even if no decisive evidence is offered that the leaders of Obam's administrations have ordered the amendments to the reports, it is stated in the report that analysts had the impression that they were from the leaders of the Centom under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the dangers presented by the Islamic State, or by the IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports of the Central Staff, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly positive than the events in fact were,” the report states.
For example, the representative of the Censula publicly declared that a major military attack to take over Mosulu could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is very clear after months of the investigation," said Ms. Mike Pompeo, the representative of the Republican Party of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015 the maximum position of intelligence staff of the U.S. headquarters with the results of the intelligence services of the staff in order to mislead the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans have assembled the working group after they have learned about the concerns of analysts that information on the Islam State intelligence services is being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must follow a more detailed examination following further investigation.
There are further investigations conducted by the Director-General of Defence.
Democracy members of the Rapporteur Committee published their own findings on Thursday that corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In the period 2014 and 2015 Centom has created a very close process for drawing up an IS and Iranian safety component assessment," said Mr Adam B. Schiff, President of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “has led to overcriminating the outputs of the intelligence services,” damaged the morality between analysts and “sufficiently taken into account disapproved opinions.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence of the fact that the White House would attempt to push on the Centom’s analysts to adjust their conclusions according to “the prerequisites or the political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times informed of the ongoing investigations of the General Inspector Pentagon, which was initiated after the complaints of the Centagon analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, spokesperson of the Pentagon, stated in the statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the General Inspector is still ongoing.
However, it stated that “experts sometimes do not agree to the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security.”
The investigation has an impact beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now proclaiming a growing number of defense leaders).
However, last year's accusations have raised questions regarding the extent to which President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Staff has sincerely evaluated military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lybia and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the intelligence of the Islamic State reflects conflicts for over ten years when the intelligence analyst of the Census Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which the administration of President George W. Bush, despite the opposition of many analysts, defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted only a little time to thinking about what will be followed by the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in opposing the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team concluded that despite the public statement of the opposite air strikes against the Islamic State's refinery, the financial resources of this terrorist group did not significantly weaken because the group built temporary refinery and oil on the black market.
The Times informed in September that the findings were not transferred outside the Central Staff.
Commander of Centom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism last year after many legislators found the Senate testimony too positive by an evaluation of war.
General Austin resigned in April and replaced him with the gen. Joseph L. Votel in Cencom.
The United States won in the ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today it's going to be a decisive match in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam in a fight against Japan, who ended up winning 6:1, shot three goals and only a day later for the American ground hockey team shot the first two goals of the game that America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five gates in two matches is a success to remember, but Bamová (27) said she was not sure if she ever succeeded.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who record their goals.
But this is what he knows: the Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 matches and they share the first place in the group with the Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0 remained un defeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams have been qualified for a quarterfinal, and the match decides who of the six teams ends up first and second.
The team from the first place will be a little longer avoided by the strong Danes who are at the forehead of the second group.
Whatever Saturday's game is over, the Americans have caused their surprising driving, four years after they ended up in London's 12 teams.
Bam was in the team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and she took a hockey on the ground hockey for the first time in her hand when she was 3 years old (her twin sisters played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The Olympics escaped her in 2008 because she didn't get to the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when she wasn't very successful, not even her members.
The next year he was appointed an Englishman Craig Parnham and things started changing.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have a work pace like we have today.
We've made a complete turnover.
On Thursday night Bam started in the first half by shooting the gates of the bekendem from the vicinity.
India joined the game without winning the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly hard and maintained the score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bamová used the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the game field, then she clipped into the center and shot the ball into the gate to get the American to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added her last gate in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The removal of the American goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who helped to make one goal in each of the three wins, was the first one at the tournament.
She's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
“We are in a good place now,” Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic wandering
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Riu de Janeir, it feels durable, insignificant and intrigued to alter competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself would be a hot shaft stake that's passed from a swimmer, gymnast and triatlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read the paper or listen to your neighbor's interview in the cafe without hearing about Simon Biles, Katie Ledecka or the inviolence between Michael Phelps and Chad le Closem.
And then he's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming lover of women with dolls in faces, is on the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be held in homes in the main broadcast time between the advertising and the spots of sponsors, if he would be a swimmer, gymnastou or even a shrimp.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California is fighting for Olympic gold in the scotch on the trampoline.
The Olympic fire doesn't light at all competitions the same.
Further from the center, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognised: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swim style - and he will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may appoint my special favority, let me draw attention to the impossible magic of the trampoline.
Even though the trampoline jumps are an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first shown at Sydney games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost without notice - many people I asked, and didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It may be a regional indifference.
The US never medaled in the scoops on the trampoline, and until 2012 none of the athletes got to the final.
Prices in male categories are usually divided between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be revealed by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennanova from Canada.
But the trampoline jumps have more bad luck, partly because the ear of the unsanctified would rather seem to be more useful at the clown university than the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but only an enthusiast from the country.
It has a comic potential - comic vibration of infinite reflection - but also the gravity of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "scock board."
Asspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them to an altitude of almost 10 meters and show the sets with several elements (salts, rolls and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to implementation, difficulty and ‘air times’.
There will be 20 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women in Riu.
The usual olympic track trajectory is forward.
The fighters of the gold medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They try to catch up not only the target belt or the starting wall, but as TV news says, another thought line: the world or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatic - and sufficient to bring the viewers to tears.
But I think it's a bit exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Trampoline jumps bring relief in this respect.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects, as if they were in a state without weight as as an astronaut, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and of course, it can't be difficult, but during the duration of the assembly there is no wrath fighting to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only perfect, delicate time fluctuation and gravity.
This is the closest thing to when the Olympics and the Zen are coming.
Qualifications and the finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13-hour eastern time, male competitions then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, which begins both days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment that you will probably overlook over the other fights.
And if the attention is to be achieved only by the fact that men's athletes will be subject to loving views and materialization - as according to the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the U.S. Gymnases - then Logan Dooley only waits for his new fans who are lying in the breath.
"Protesting generation" in Ethiopia, US long-term allies
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrates demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered a violent opposition to the government.
The witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during the police conflicts.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
During the last few months, however, the country has delighted the anti-governmental distress that is spreading into more and more areas.
Just in the past week, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was immovable.
The witnesses say the police shot and killed the unarmed demonstrators.
On circular video recordings from protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, the security forces are captured as young people hit by holes after they were forced to stand at the walls on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and make it even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most human nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with Ethiopia to remove the danger of terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few from African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiomy evolved at an impressive pace.
Her infrastructure has substantially improved - in the capital of Addis Abeba rides even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model for democracy - organizations fighting for human rights without stopping speak of government repressions - the opposition in the country has been repressed, disidentially silent.
Many of them have been pronounced, trapped, killed or expelled far into the desert.
However, that may change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakdown," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youths.
He's protesting generations.
Complaints are many and relate to all disputes about land to absolute control of the power of ruler coalition.
After last elections which were widely criticized, the ruler party and its allies received the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. The conflict along this inaccurate, disputed border requested hundreds of lives in June.
Anyliti are afraid that separatist groups, which have been more or less repressed during the past years, such as the Oromian Liberation Front or the Ogadean National Liberation Front, may try to use confusion and rearrange themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now after years of cigars under the surface, these bitter feelings have reinflamed.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopans can communicate through social networks up to the last few years when they have become commonly available cheaper smart phones and have improved the provision of online services.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as usual, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via the Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopans have talked about how they gathered themselves for protests.
There is further solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian leaders of Ethiopia, appeared in politics and trade and used the Oroms, many Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that also changes.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulat Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is not rightly dominated by members of the Tigraya ethnic, which constitute around 6 percent of the population and control the army, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason of distress is Meles Zenawi's death.
Zenawi, former leader of rebellions, was the Ethiopia Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered unaffected diseases.
He was considered to be a tactical genius, a man who could see behind the corner.
The analysts say that he was particularly mastery to reveal the primary signals of dissatisfaction and to use the emissaries to process and gain the opponents on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, the analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was extracted from relative ignorance to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who originated in the northern Ethiopia Tigraya region, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts claim that they have no confidence in security services controlled by the Tigreans.
Many fear that there will be another bloodshed.
Last time, Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what the analysts referred to as the elections the government took away and then stole.
He followed a hard hit during which many protesters were killed - even though less than in the past months - and this period of riots went relatively fast.
Development experts evaluated the leaders of Ethiopia for visionary infrastructure planning such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual increase of disputes within the Ethiopia government did not stop it.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amhar City of Gondar attacked business companies owned by the Tigreans and obstacles against the Tigreans on social networks are increasingly common.
Analysts say that protests are being put into an unpleasant situation of the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for the dron flights over the neighboring Somalia, although recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, he also does not want his ally to be disintegrated in such an unstable area.
“This,” said Abdi, “it is a very sharp edge blade.”
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS financing as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to bagatelize the latest controversy that floods his campaign, by saying that he didn't mean it when several times this week insisted that Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "conspirators" of the Islamic terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions regarding the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly with the American public.
He also puts in an unpleasant situation for his advocates who were strugglingly defending him in a stormy time and must explain that he might not have been serious about his comments.
After this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday at night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, and in the interviews he insisted that he did not really intend to say that the President and H. Clinton IS were created.
However, in the Twitter post on Friday morning Trump declared he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the claim of the old one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he meant his accusations on the contrary.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump remedy the note by reminding Obama to try to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preference in the pre-election surveys are dropping.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan duel this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return on this topic.
On Twitter, he warned again that Clinton's proposals are linked to an increase in taxation, and said that her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense earlier.
At the end of July, when he cleaned up the wave of criticism, when he came out with the suggestion that the Russians should penetrate Clinton's e-mails, the note later explains: “I am, of course, sarcastic.”
This approach enables Trump to push the borders of political declarations and to calm them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing, to what extent some of the response reports have with his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction, then in one or another, "issued an explanation," Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who watched the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that in his statements he is vigorous and knows that they are sufficiently varying to explain them differently.
Since the results of the pre-election surveys continue to decline, Trump has chosen a more stubborn tone in the last days, instead of milling things for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a great distance to Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid apology for provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his criticism of misunderstanding his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with the Trump in the final months of the Presidential campaign, the jokes of Trumps put in an unpleasant situation of his dedicated followers, who must publicly stand behind him, whatever his remarks are provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York, one of the most prominent Trump's followers, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in the CNN interview.
"I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani when he was asked about Trump’s credibility that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that IS was almost unknown to Obama, a small organization that he misleadedly called a new man, and it happened because he dropped his troops from Iraq.
Most of the common Republicans are trying to argue by the fact that the Obama government, in which Clinton acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed the IS to be struggling and unable to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump, he continued to have a fire around himself on Twitter for turning every word of it and being taken into account.
He laughed at the “both, pathetic, ” of the TV scholars who tried to understand him, and said, “It can't do it!”
Several Democrats deprived Trump's apology that it was just another proof that it was not eligible for the Presidential Office.
The café has been pushed out of the price market. Now it's back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a nasty place in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out from the headquarters of the Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop that Verb replaced in summer 2014 - sells soaps in the form of cakes.
The locals cried it as the last loss of the growing city.
Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is full and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it's a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened up last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there, and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Also, coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the original cafe, which is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb, he began in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay for a transfer to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things just as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model machine for espresso.
He even used the lights from the old Verbu again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The offer offers sandwiches with ham, eggs and cheese and toppings, such as capary and fried onions.
You'll also find the bowls of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer gives you a beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the permanent flow of the original stumgasts.
"A number of original customers had to move out from Williamsburg for prices," he said.
Last Sunday was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
Even when the café moved to Greenpoint, she was there.
She said when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbu," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day she gave a mixed chai, another news instead of her usual ice coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been dedicating to Verbu since 2003.
He goes before work, and he always orders the same thing.
"Third and eight in here every day, as a watch, I come and prepare my swing with everything and butter for me," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add a new ingredient to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he gets all his bacon, egg and ham on his swing.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as a ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Also the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have accepted the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer to Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to build it soon to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local producer of fruit juice wants to stand in bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility for the café to spread to the neighboring building.
Many customers just got their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the cafe opened up again, walk in and have coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after the meeting of the President's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt tasted on selected dishes from the 5th avenue, such as the sausage of goose javelts and the marine turtle soup.
His menu on this day was more modest: eggs on the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potato pyre and as a dessert of Swedish pudding.
"It was a cooking act of solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also the message to the Americans how to eat.”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are dedicated to gastronomic history.
The last book Andrew Coeo “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in his book “97 Orchard” tells a life story of a living house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They showed the cook's solidarity and the reporter met at Eisenberg's sandwich trade, a small sloppy buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with peanut olives, Andrew (57) had a turkey, potato potato and a mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carpenter that, according to a couple, was greatly fit to talk about food during the crisis.
"The carrots were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
He used to sell peanuts, liver and bean carrots.
They were made from the mesh and other cheap food that set up the ingredients.
Turn over the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's been strangled.
"They would lie in your stomach as lead," he said.
Years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was administered by a buffet eaten as you eat.
Women's teams cooked for workers from the farm and for breakfast, lunch and dinner with freshly cooked pie.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War. “A Square Meal” watches the ways of the nation to deal with the fact that it suddenly wasn’t the country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe explained why he and his wife decided to write it.
The same was feared by the new budgetary diet: it expanded with mysterious meals, like carbates and dishes from castresses, castters like “a wonderful way to use the residues,” said Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide non-esthetic ingredients under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after a long year the central point of the American food - has become a cost-effective luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were meant to serve as a caloric and nutrient fill, preferred to taste or even healthy sense of cooking.
During the surveys for a book that contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman has prepared a timeful food from baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: “It was surreal.”
Pomegranate butter with baked onion can't be combined.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the serial number of the federal government for the domestic economy in the years 1923 to 1943 - managed the dietary habits of the country.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over budget burdens, and slippers, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, converted into tasteful food.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical delights.
First of all, the desserts were made in response to the government to its hungry citizens, such as the poses of President Herbert Hoover “I'll have pie.”
While he publicly praised the simple pharmaceutical cuisine of his childhood, he stood as the chosen millionaire he became.
"The council ate continental cuisine, such as fish with ophthalmade sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in a almost glazed room, had a tuxedo on.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him go with her own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who didn't care about the taste, which led to the fact that the White House “not only served the most diverse meal in Washington but also in the most distressed way prepared.”
A number of food habits from the time of the crisis have disappeared as soon as the country has rearranged its legs.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
A few say that while writing a book, they understood the dietary habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother -- maybe why she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting with food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “The people were sick of her.”
There's been an accident with the pennies.
When the clean tables were at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert that they prepared at home: a steep dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"He's called stew cream," she said Ziegelman, and she added that the usual trick was to give the humble recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just hamsters, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone's unwillingly hit a spoon in a dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a good housekeeper, he said to his wife: “It would be worth a bit of peanut flags.”
Europeans: Migrants are going to get their benefits.
Most refugees who are going to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
This would be the show if we were to shoot them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us makes fun of his native country.
Using a photoshop, he creates collages that funnyly show what it would look like if the famous shows and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the case of a patent against type C yellows against Merck
The judge of the county court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to repay the fees for lawyers that were incurred in the process regarding the type C patent against Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturers.
In June, the judgment, according to which Gilead had to pay 200 million for damage due to the violation of the two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was cancelled, after the federal judge found repeatedly counter-legal negotiations on the side of Merck, in addition to the lie under oath and other non-ethical practices.
The Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to admission of the fees incurred in connection with the representation of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the market for new generations against type C yellow, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed that they were the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead medicines.
Americans supported by military forces claim to have received full control of the city of Manbíd
The military units supported by the United States received full control of the northern town of Manbíd near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic state fighters from the city fled, said the spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now proving the city after leaving the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The units have released over 2,000 civilians that radicals have detained, said by Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbíd military council.
"The town is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," said Agent Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its tax confession for 2015, in which it was stated that the presidential candidate for the Democrats and her husband had revenues of $10.75 million in that year and had a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons spent $1 million on charity, mostly at the Clinton Foundation. The Exrezident Bill Clinton contributed to the common cash by almost a feeee of $5.3 million for lectures, and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs granted a revenue of $3 million from the publisher of Simon & Schuster for his book of activity at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's co-chairman, American senator Tim Kaine, Virginia, together with their wife Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
These paid a real tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides for false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that his tax confession will publish.
It's a habit that candidates for the U.S. President will publish their tax confessions, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, New York trader, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the US Ministry of Finance Department of Taxation as a reason for refusal of the tax confession to be published.
"Your move," said the subsidiary of Hillary Clinton's campaign on Twitter and committed a tax confession to a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump adviser, said on Thursday CNN that Trump wouldn't let the tax confession be published until the audits were over.
According to Trump's critics, among which the Republican candidate for the President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, the contribution to charity, trade transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton's question is a strong performance and published a video on Friday, in which it recalls how high the status of the Republican Republican is insisted on publishing its tax confessions.
On Thursday, mention the question in your speech to the economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other candidates have done for the Presidential Office for decades - to publish their tax confessions," she said in front of people.
Politico said that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claimed that this could be the case at present.
The rates of federal taxes have become a subject in the presidential election.
Clinton is prosecuting a rule named after Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all who earn more than $1 million per year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaza, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax confessions.
Buffett said that he also passed the IRS audit and that Trump is “bearing” of the Financial Office, but voters.
Clinton's campaign published the tax return until 2007.
On average, Clintons who live in Chappaqua in the state of New York paid a federal tax of 32 percent on average between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of around 40.5 percent.
The 2015 tax confession of Clintons shows that, unlike most Americans, they pay only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton gave income to dividends and interest of EUR 109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or elephant fireworks in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human habitats - throwing on them condoms filled with chili powder.
This procedure has proved and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came with the idea a few years ago, together with the American ecological organization The Nature Conservancy, has promoted and trained volunteers in the villages in the north of Tanzania, as through this inviolent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Many of them used a spear earlier in their defense.
Friday is the world day of elephants dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“From being developed by this... a set of tools, we have recorded a change of behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their field without hurting them,” said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Foundation in the statement.
The first and second step is to light a flashlight on the coming elephant and start the cloakson.
If he doesn't dispose of it, he's about to throw out the so-called chili blade.
Chilli powder mixed with salt and petarda packed in a condom, his end is so that he only looks at a knot.
The condom will explode after the launch, and the fine chilli powder will blow up into the air.
It's usually just one thread, and the elephant's going in a different direction.
The last option is to launch the fireworks that causes a loud, bright explosion.
The Jewish director opposed himself to the Berlin Hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel on the "require" of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a rash in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin has not included a code for calling to Israel, according to the words of the staff on the basis of the “requirement” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary picture of the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German FAZ journal.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of calls codes in the hotel.
However, the state was not listed among countries to which it can be called directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers instead the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with a problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, according to his words, “soked.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was ‘determined after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels’.
The reason for this step, the director, even more, popped.
“A large number of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the call code of Israel be deleted,” quoted Lanzmann’s staff in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Ambassador of Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, declared the case “a great shame”.
We were terrified and shocked by the events.
It's a huge shame about itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain, is even more disgraceful.
There's no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the correct conclusions," said.
The event caused a strong reaction online, people marked it as scandal.
Some believe that the hotel Kempinski simply “was lost” in the requirements of Arabic customers.
“Hanba you,” says another allowance, which points to the fact that the hotel, which is located in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel's own book, the hotel was quickly charged by referring to the event as a “overlooking” and Lanzman’s “reconciliation”.
“Never issued a direct order” does not include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projections against protesting Brazilian students
Students and police had a conflict in San Paulo, Brazil on Thursday, when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projections against protesters.
The problem threatened when government order services tried to disrupt students, which ended up using rubber projections and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Gerald Alckmine to save money is also the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the transfer of 300 000 students.
Some of the demonstrations were able to see how they spray writings against the temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The most recent protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators went massively to the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff when the senation in the country decided to defend her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan grew up after the cancellation of the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran business turnover in an annual comparison by 70.9 percent.
As the Ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, there has been an increase in the interest of the Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies renew existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to enter.
Another expansion of trade is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia exported to Iran by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jumping increase in trade has ensured supplies of machinery equipment, ground vehicles and weapons," said Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35 000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly travelling.
In addition, Iran first got among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists who arrive in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," said.
At the same time, Iran visits a relatively small number of Russians.
“I myself can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazda, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved,” he said.
Scotch Callum Skinner is in a hurry home after the British gained gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of glory last night in the male team sprint on the velodrome in Ria, when the VB trio defended the title from London 2012.
Thirty-year-old Glasgowa rodent was in the role of a brake that he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man pleased the legend when he joined the goal and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain won a surprisingly four years ago and Hoy got five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth in the world championship in the track cycling in March, even though Hoy had ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for a specialised introductory racing driver Jamie Staff.
Hinds showed up just in time.
After Hoy's departure, the place that he tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton also relaxed.
Skinner was the man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hinds - who was champ with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record on his qualifications, but the trickot took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hinds was lightly behind his bike, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner's running.
The change of the strategy was a great part of the transformation when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up.
The Hoy race followed the BBC commentator from his position, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hinds stepped out on stage, they didn't release their eyes.
Thirty-three-year-old Skinner, a Glasgov rodent, said: “It is a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to get the best of myself and do the honor of my name.
We made the Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose after a weak start.
The note later dropped back, and the British opponents had no option to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “I felt like London with all those British flags on the tribune. ”
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've lost in many world races, so it's just amazing to win the Olympics again.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation, who won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress in the past five months, then we are waiting for a successful five days on the velodrome.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not inconceivable that Hoy would repeat his success and win three gold medals on one Olympic at the same time.
That would be for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also his birthday on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
Just as much as he got Hoy.
As another Kenny will participate in a sprint that begins today and will last another three days.
An eighteen-year-old native from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
The team's always the best.
You're winning with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When another two gold medals win, he should have a knight's title.”
That was the only medal race that day, but Britain was expecting other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull have been qualified as the fastest team for four kilometers.
They're done with time 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) are held on the second day of the race, which will ultimately focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the Commissioners when the arbitrator invited him to measure his height.
In the similar race of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trottová, Joanna Rowsell Shandová, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie's world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on his strong team of track cyclists and controlled the middle season of the Olympic games and gained a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating the absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have declined during preparations for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events were held, last but not least, the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April for the charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of the greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of races on the velodrome adds, the legendary reputation that the UK team can give a top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Insecure Future of Lamps in Portland after the end of the Energy Supplier
The future of the Portland aluminium tractor in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power supply of the company and which informed one of the owners of the supply contracts for electricity. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
This step takes place after the State of Victoria’s Government has decided earlier this year that it will not extend the provision of subsidies that the company maintains.
The fixed 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk of up to 2000 jobs.
When closing, up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
And since the trunk consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it may be possible to achieve further avalanche impact.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's tavivor in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoa's tavern in Portland is profitable and threatens to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation regarding the future of the company, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the plant.
The AGL, which delivers a large aluminum to the Loy Yang A electricity in the Latrobe Valley Valley, declared that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint company of Alcoa and Alumina, a small trade share held by CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the portland race to continue to work, in other words, that demand for electricity from the tractor will continue,” said.
AGL argued that the contracts were the so-called ‘procurement contracts’ which were to enter into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will participate in the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, declared the power plant.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to a strong view of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that she had already written the value of contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million “in the event of termination”.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract “is not an impact on its ... ability to operate the timber or to secure the supply of electricity into the tavern.”
The American company said that in 2010 she and Loy Yang had concluded a 20-year contract that should have started paying since November this year, even though she had to explain why she had withdrawn from the contract.
Analyticians are very careful with regard to the possible closure of the portland tractor in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of a weak economy in the sector.
The manager of the AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen operation, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts annually.
If both of these companies were withdrawn from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real estate TV show Kardashian - now is the cover of the bright Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the Clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the headline page of the light release of the American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, Ambassador of Estee Lauder, who presented a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her account at Instagram.
"In a room full of people I love, he wants to cry on this title page," wrote Kendall.
The exploration of the title page followed bizarre (or simply continuing the mood in the Kardashian submission?) the inspired video in which the whole family of the Kardashian-Jenner family was (bar riders Rob and Caitly and together with all the favorite Uncles from the Swiss, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters, they forgot that the scene could end with the classic turnover: they prepare a secret party.
It's almost every "born" work of the children's television show (Seacrest says: "You thought we had forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on the show at 8:00 in the morning, but Kris needed to make sure that the other girls on this public could feed.
Because when we look at Vogue's light number, we've definitely entered the new era of the Kardashians.
The older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (it was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the light release of the magazine is another league.
Vogue magazine's lightest issue is the most sold number of all year.
The issue, which by its thickness reminds more of the advertisement book than the fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist counted that from 832 pages last edition were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years the photographs of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Women that appeared in the past on the envelope include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, more “celebrits that make models” have appeared on the front page than “models that are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's holder, and Dior's Ambassador, appeared at the headline in 2013, was honored by Lagy Gaga a year later.
But even though it's very unlikely that Kendall - which magazine describes as a "first-breaking model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, will be in a very good society.
These celebrities are not related to known people, or stars of real estate shows, or kids today who know how to do a well-cut video (also when Jenner represents all this).
They are proven talented women who are excellent in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of Lemonade albums.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled about the success of Jenner.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult for her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model in June criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, and called them "the girls of the moment".
These feelings have reconciled with the report that Jenner will appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of the bright Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you images of themselves on their own paywalle.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter that took pictures for the Lov magazine.
And in the free moments, it works in a reality show, maybe only as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Legal assistance centres will refuse 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected every year in the community centres of legal assistance and in the sector themselves are about to draw on the impacts that will have further restrictions on the funding of the already over-tilled service.
In Queensland, three of five people - mostly advanced ages, immigrants, the threat of workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unfair eviction and similarly - are denied when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are about to go to other cuts.
Since June next year, these legal assistance centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
The Director of the Community centres of legal assistance in Queenslad James Farrell said that, according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Community Centres of Legal Aid was found to be rejected every year by 5,000 people.
Mr. Farrell said that without revoking the federal government's decision, the situation will get worse.
"The Chamber Centres of Legal Aid in Queensland are chronically underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected by the vital services they need," said.
People who escaped from relations with a rapist, people with excessive and shrinking debts, families passing away, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which will lead to further thousands of people at risk from Queensland will have to know in complex legal problems without help.
We call on the state representative and Senator Queensland George Brandis to prevent this shortening of finance immediately to get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government has reached its commitment to ensure that legal assistance is financed up to the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the community centres of legal assistance and the community of their clients and the government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
Appointment for Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the staff allegedly targeted the weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was filed for alleged ineffectiveness after being told that the director of the operation in North Carolina in February directed the weapon to the staff member during the jeep ride.
The incident was described in a court file, which was handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer in the state at the center of the State Court in Charlotte.
Bordini said that for months, he waited for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that “it is not going to happen.”
Principal Earl Phillip “named the pistol fingers, gave the real insight to the trigger and headed Vincent to the lens,” said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini, after complaints at the local and regional management campaign, found that at least four other people experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"The guns don't have to fire to cause damage," said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican candidate for the President has brought up an uprising when the voters in North Carolina said that they could take action by the owners and arms holders (which is modified in the US in the second addition of the constitution), if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and will be able to appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and Trump didn't defend violence.
Bordini in the prosecution asks the campaign to replace for negligible supervision and from Phillip for the threat of personal security, the illegal use of violence and the cause of emotional injury.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks didn't react immediately on her request.
The attempts to get Phillip's statements were failed.
WCCB, the local intelligence department in Charlotte, announced that Phillip left the campaign recently.
A telephone call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not been responding in a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump leads a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will also be the source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is in a huge way attractive, just like London 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from Olympic games.
Olympic games meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities we will create 10,000 new teaching sites, 40,000 new jobs and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be tases here, who will think that Heathrow's enlargement is too big.
I was told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we will make ourselves laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
Heathrow will always have to overcome obstacles, but heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
As well as the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure, which participates in many people and companies, not only a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave inheritance in the form of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, in the deadline and budget, introduced an investment programme for 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal - which was elected the best terminal in the world five years behind, after the terminal T2 that was built between the two most disturbing ranves in the world.
They are now ready to add the third ranch worth £16 billion of private investment.
Games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Great Britain and I believe that enlargement of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to continue spreading the spirit of the Olympic games and expanding Heathrow, to ensure trading in the future and leave the inheritance of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Minister for Finance Business Affairs.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on cat and mouse in blocking advertising
From trying to circumvent advertisement blockers, it became a game of cat and mouse for companies that make online marketing. At least it says one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a contribution on its website, in which it is stated that users can update filters in their program and re-blocking advertising on this social network.
On Tuesday Facebook stated that his desktop website would change the encoding around advertising to make it easier to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But now Adblock claims that the new codes have already been circumvented.
Speaker of Adblock, Ben Williams, in his blog post, wrote that “some war between the open source blocking community and those who are trying to circumvent them lasts since the blocking of advertising has been invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come with another repair.
The fact that the company owned the world's largest social network in the war just proves the big problem of blocking advertising for industry.
According to the study, the one last year did Pagefair and Adobe uses around 200 million people's advertising filters - almost four times before 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of Facebook advertising, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said, however, that the company is going against desktop advertising filters because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for social network and Instagram are not working.
Desktop advertising continues to represent profits so high to Facebook decide to invest in it.
On Tuesday, Facebook also stated that it would update the tool for "distribution" (ad preferences) to give people a better control of how advertising is displayed.
On Thursday Facebook said that the new filters of Adblock are concerned because they could also block the content that does not relate to the advertising.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” said spokesman Facebook in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertisements is an insensitive tool, and that's why we'd rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The wife hit a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of the event that, on Thursday morning, a few cars crossed the highway by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in Vaud Canton shortly after midnight in Thursday.
The Vaud police said in the statement that the actress of the "sufficient act" was in the dark on the road and took over several cars.
It's clear that the victim, the woman at 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her a few cars, including the truck.
She died in place.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, they have still not all been identified.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in the situation like this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve, the legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to stop the crash?
This must be found out by the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases from past five years, drivers seem not to be responsible.
In both cases - in one of which it was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a walker passing through the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, the police officer was removed from the charges for the death of negligence after she hit and killed the man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in August 2014.
In court, the victim at the age of 22 was drinking alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to emergency calls - was in a reasonable way and that the presence of a man on the road was “a very special and unpredictable situation,” said the judge.
Anyone with information about the quarterly incident that occurred in Morges should log in to the police on phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination of the LGBT community.
The association of Czech travel agencies and agencies (AČCKA) expects to arrive up to 20,000 visitors within Prague Pride.
On Friday, CEO AČCKA told Kateřina Petříčková.
The sixth year Prague Pride started on August 8th, the festival is approaching the life of lesbians, gay people, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
About 35,000 people attended last year.
"Prague belongs to the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized enterprises," said Petříčková.
According to the survey, foreign visitors spend 3100 crowns per person on average daily.
Gay tourists are available to support their traveling special maps Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism, it generally applies that LGBT clientela is very lucrative, he is interested in stays in higher price relations with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," said Petříčková.
As part of the festival program, the first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, 14 August.
The main topic this year is love, but the action will also focus on a number of thematic areas that are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Václav Square to Letna on Saturday.
In the past years, the course of thousands of people attended will honor the silence of the memory of the victim of the June attack in the nightclub in Orland, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate 40 years.
Disgusting Pat and Mat, whose efforts are usually ended by disaster, enjoy small and large viewers for 40 years.
The pilot part of this evening show, director Lubomír Beneš, was premiered on 12 August 1976.
For the creation of this animated show, which now knows viewers in over hundreds of countries of the world, cartoon jokes were made by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he thought for the magazine with the two masters Ouholík and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited Jiří Kubička and the artist Vladimir Jiránk to cooperate and together created a film by Kuťáci.
Today's form with a yellow and red trick and a sphere and a radio was given characters in 1979, when in the short movie Prague the show for Slovakia's television began.
Names Pat and Mat then received the kutils in 1985, this time it was turning directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Benš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where more parts were created.
After his death in 1995, further works were continued with other creators, many of them were involved in the Beneš's son Marek.
At present there are over 90 episodes with stories of these chops, which all fall under their hands, but they never get angry with each other, and they are always fulfilling optimism, ideas, and kutilian enthusiasm, and eventually they are satisfied with their work, which adds to a known gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television screens to books, to DVD and to the theatre and figures or other toys with the image of Pat and Mata are the hit of every toymaker.
A fairy tale for Fiji and the two-year-old Harmonia.
The end of the week is in a sign of fairy tale, we chose one sports and one of your lives for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's go take a look.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
Two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what things do people spend most on airports for?
That's the fifth overview of the world's websites.
First Olympic medals.
Historical success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's choice of this conspiracy was defeated in the Olympic Tournament of the Seventh Rugby team of Great Britain.
It's the first medal ever gained for Fiji on the Olympics.
The waiting for the profit of the first precious metal lasted 60 years after sending the first trip to the Olympic Games.
Big credit for success is given by Coach Fiji.
However, it is ironic that it is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied unlike its countrysides.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can do the biggest match in our history," the coach said before the finale.
Fiji finally superbed him, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now having an Olympic fairy tale.
The report brought by Le Monde's French journal.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living out of hand since 11 months, and she's got her legs a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," rejoiced with a two-year-old girl, as she told her mother for ABC News.
She added that her daughter liked virgins to take off her hands and legs, and then she sits together without a prosthesis.
Harmonia has been diagnosed in less than a year of life with type B meningitis, and the doctors only gave her a 10% chance to survive.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and never gives up.
He's got an oversight.
I've seen her introduce herself to other children with words Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother has added.
Look at the joy the doll has made.
What do we spend most on the airport for?
CNN brings the findings that people at airports spend the most of their spending on packed water.
Hudson's salesman's travel essential stores published the data in the last year, where it summarizes 10 products that customers buy most often in its shops at airports.
The water was suverénly first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place occupied a large pack of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the first ten?
As one of the above things you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
These are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Veslarian sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they laughed at Murray and Bond.
The villagers of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have superbly reigned the category of twins without a cormilar for seven years and confirmed their domination at the Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro.
At first sight, the unborn couple moved to a smaller crew after the Olympics in Beijing and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the lagoon of Rodriga de Freitase, the 69th win was awarded in the fourth final.
What are we different from the others?
We're just nicer, Murray was joking during the Olympic regatt when he was supposed to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand pair.
To be honest, we don't do anything different than the others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve my technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray more serious.
Their domination is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost a two-meter and a slope chase, a academic-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 pounds lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond is studying and devoted to finance, Murray has, for example, a charitable boxer fight.
They don't spend much time outside of the voyage, either.
Eric's getting into the boat essentially with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what could be wrong, to admit Bond, who, even at the press conference, demonstrated that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He's always answered first, and Bond's been waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, they destroy the rival with calm power.
They're running their pace, and even though they're often not in the midway, their gradual accelerators have not yet found a prescription.
We're running on a two-km track, and we never wanted to go the first mile back.
We're just trying to drive a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, say the 40-year-old Murray.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals in the world championship.
They also terrorized in 2007 when they were both members of the golden four without a corridor.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew on the Beijing Olympics, one year later, they decided to move on to two without a cormilar.
In London's Olympics, apparently, the biggest defeat of their careers has defected and the domination also confirmed in Ria.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time, it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be bloody hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally good at it, said Murray.
We know everyone wants to throw us out of the throne.
We have the target on our backs all the time.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
The NASA climate model: Venus was once resident
According to the projection of the new climate model NASA, Venus was once resident.
Scientists in Goddard's NASA Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus through instruments and algorithms similar to those who use climate study scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once in the Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and saturated CO2, could have been undermined by conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that low speed of turning Venus can be explained by its density atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and turned slowly.
The model also dealt with the former Venus topography.
On the planet, they were probably dryer than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life on it and to provide protection against rapid evaporation.
The Venus used the sun, which was 30 percent more silent.
“In simulation of the GISS Venus model during the slow turn, its daily side is exhibiting to the sun almost two months at a time,” explained the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in the new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the formation of rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella and the surface is deformed from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model has built Venus' story like an evolution that has previously been hypothetically assembled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was likely resident in the past -- over a few billion years -- she was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans have evaporated, and the water couples have been burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and remained only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy resigned as a team coach of Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday his post as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team, as a reason why he said the inability to participate in the decision-making process in the team's questions.
The vice president/general manager Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed the step and said that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"The last three years I have been coaching and vice president of the hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
I've been thinking long and intense over the years how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of the hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organisation.
They must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who adopted Roye on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
"Patrick informed me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he did for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
The team has earned 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. But the Colorado has dealt with Minnesota in the first round of play-off, and in the last two years, he has never always had a match after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season scored 39:39:4 and lacked five points to get the second wild card in the Western conference.
Brancher Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Petroleum platform workers renew conversations and break the strike
The top representatives of the parties claimed that the strikes due to the wages for petroleum workers in the North Sea were interrupted while all parties of the dispute met at the new negotiating round.
The strikes against the company of services for the Wood Group have taken place in the North Sea, which is operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for the current disagreement,’ is stated in the statement.
From next week, we will have a number of full-day meetings during the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent actions, which, according to their words, were first for over 25 years, are up to 30 percent to protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group reduced rates this year and paid about 9 percent less to its suppliers in the North Sea due to negative market pressure.
The reduction of company rates comes after a 10 % reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that other cuts would provide space for companies to deal with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has erased thousands of people from his paylists and announced plans to leave the oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries for the modernisation of their processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
Member of the Parliament from Scotland Dave Anderson met with professional speakers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disagreements of the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and all over the country, we need a economy that works for all, not only for some," said in the statement.
For comparison, almost $1.4 billion investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, while the average for the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of turning stars in Plejadas
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain almost a complete list of speeds of turning stars from the Starshop of Plejada.
New data help astronomers understand why the stars are spinning at different speeds, as well as how the turning time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other starshops we will learn more about the relationship between star mass, age and even history in her solar system," said Luisa Rebullová, research worker in the centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Starshop Plejada is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the shunt are now reaching the status of adulthood and have been formed over 125 million years.
Now they're turning as fast as possible.
At the maximum speed of turning, these teenage stars release a huge amount of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the ageing of the star, the speed of the star is slowing down.
Kepler measures the speed of turning each star so that it measures the time between discovering discernible points on stars -- similar sun spots.
According to the latest data on the speeds of turning, the larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, make piruettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" we see that the slower rolling stars are massive, while those that are rolling fastest are usually very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the starshop Plead is so close, it serves as an ideal space lab for comparing the quality of stars and speeds of turning.
"Pleads provide an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, with younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when, and why the stars slow down their speed of turning and so they say, "save their dance shoes on the nails."
Rebull and her colleagues described the latest analysis of the speed of turning Plead in three studies, which will soon be published in the magazine Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I hadn't signed up, then would the qualification agreement not be concluded, and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without entering into specialised education?
It is my concern that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a free job only in a more distant hospital, but in about six months, I would like to work in another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to solve the situation for about half a year, the question continues.
Mgr. Lenka Vlková corresponds.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
The Qualification Agreement shall be the legal institution regulated by the Labour Law and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return of incurred costs associated with increasing or deepening the qualification of the staff.
In the field of health, there is a long-term pressure on the non-conclusion of these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
In accordance with Law No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional qualifications and specialised competences for the exercise of a medical profession of a doctor, dental doctor and pharmacist, it expressly applies that participation in specialising education is deemed to be a prolongation of the qualifications (not to increase it).
This means that the Qualification Agreement can be concluded according to the Labour Code only if the costs are at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or obligation to apply for specialisation education is set.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for specialisation education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to carry out the profession of a doctor already thanks to the graduation of the required university study, although under the law laid down conditions (under professional supervision of a specialised qualified doctor in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional training may be included in the training of a physician in a different field of specialisation, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant education programme.
It would be theoretically possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the Tasaquin.
However, given that I do not know the approximate circumstances of this case, it can be recommended to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Scientific and Medical professions) as the Ministry of Health provides a consultative and consultative service related to the inclusion and conduct of specialisation.
The consultancy service also provides free of charge with the Czech Medical Chamber, the member of which each physician must be.
The doctors from Syrian Halab are asking for an intervention from the U.S.
The United States did not make any effort to put an end to the siege (resurrected parts of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence on the enforcement of civilians' protection, quoted from the letter addressed to the White House by the AFP Agency.
"We don't need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create an unflightless zone on the eastern Halab to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," said doctors.
The Russian forces that support the army to be loyal to President Bashar Asad have announced that they will stop strikes every day for three hours in the area of Halab to allow safe passage to the humanitarian convoys.
All military activities, air attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped from 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ.
Although Stephen O'Brien welcomed the humanitarian operations of the United Nations, he stressed, however, that at least a two-day truce is needed.
The AFP says that 15 out of 35 doctors who operate in the eastern part of Halab have already been controlled by the rebels.
He says that during the five-year war they were witnessing violent, cruel death of uncommon patients, friends and colleagues.
The world observes and notes how complex Syria is, but does not do much to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from Syrian regime, and Russia sounds like only lightly covered threats, quoted by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
The doctors said that 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria have been reported in the past month, from which 15 to the hospitals in which they work.
We're most sad to decide who lives and who dies.
There are so serious injuries that we need to choose between them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, describe the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the explosion cut the oxygen supply into their incubators.
They were breathing and then their life ended - before he could really begin, they reminded.
The army loyal to President Bashar asad, which supports Russian forces, has been surrounded by rebels controlled by the eastern part of Halab in the past weeks, was found without food supply of more than 200,000 people.
The Rebels who are under constant hits of the Russian and Syrian air force managed to break down and launch anti-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then came in the city and its surroundings to reinforcement.
