Barack Obama gets the fourth American President Nobel's Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive in Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take Nobel's peace price here as the fourth American president in history.
Diploma, medals and a check for $1.4 million will, among other things, receive exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
Chief of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolitan in the morning and with Michelle's wife and be busy.
First, he starts with the Nobel Institute, where he meets five members of the Committee, who chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president's couple then has a scheduled meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
Then this afternoon, the visit will culmination of the ceremony, which Obama will take over the prestigious appreciation.
He'll get it as the fourth American president, but only the third one that gets the price right in the office.
The White House has already acknowledged that Obama will speak about the Afghan War when taking over the award.
The President does not want to avoid this topic because he realizes that the price takes over as a president who is currently fighting in two countries.
War effort a few days ago has increased sending more units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasise any of his critics.
During the Obama ceremony he will also receive a gold medal, diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (as 24 million Czech crowns).
They're going to put for charity purposes, but they haven't decided on a specific charity yet.
The loaded program then will lead the president with his husband to the banquet, where, besides the Norwegian king and queen, the ministerial president and another 250 invited guests will be.
Obama has been more resilient from the beginning to the price.
For example, he showed that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just a price for him, but for all who seek the same values as him.
He said immediately after the announcement, he's a "a call for action" for him.
Nature protector accused of blackmailing
Litoměřická policie accused the chairman of the Civil Society of Nature Protectors of the Extortion of Litoměřice.
In several cases, last year, he appealed to some of the construction proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit, said the litoměř police spokesman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the litoměřical Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studnička.
Now he's in custody, and he's at risk for up to three years of prison.
Breathing containers don't smell very much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort out beverages from drinks, in the South Moravian villages you will meet the sorting containers on every step.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes before you find a suitable dumpster.
I don't want to say that the waste wouldn't be handled in Brno at all.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic that is insufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest league of sorting waste not only because as citizens, we can still throw paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but mainly the number of dumpsters for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle into a collection basket in the center?
It's a done buddy, especially time and nerve.
The only place I've hit so far is on the Moravian Square across from the Lost Hus.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think it's a hell of a lot.
Not to mention that in other parts there is no sorting of waste of honey.
A lot of my friends don't like the garbage.
Out of the leaf.
They have it far to the garbage.
I don't blame them.
I offered myself to throw out some glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But I didn't see any color garbage in the sight of Kounic's street.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place on the way to the shark.
However, the dumped out of it.
It's still the center of Brno, which perhaps most represents the city, isn't it?!
But ecology and some aesthetic probably don't really care about Brno Socialists.
These towns would rather buy a hockey extralig, which will make us shame all over the Republic than buy a few extra containers and offer a sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad that I've been able to confirm my presumption for a while on the internet by official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
"Paroubk's budget took money for retirement and sickness
After the left has added, despite the view of the government to farmers or officials, there may not be money for pensions, sickness or building savings in the budget.
But also for the interest in state debt or international court disputes.
It will cause problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social Democrats and Communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relyed on sensitive expenditures, pensions or sickness governments to borrow additionally. "It is just to put problems in the future, putting mins," says Janota.
For money borrowed is increasingly paying interest and sometimes returns.
There's not much to choose from where to take it, a state.
If they do not reduce social benefits or costs for the country’s operation, they must raise taxes.
All the left has now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
The pensions or the sickness that have disappeared from the account of 1.8 billion do not have to worry people will get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more owed – there will be only 163 billion next year, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase faster and with him as well as the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay it, and it will no longer be suffice to increase the VAT or reduce the maternity, as the government did in its antideficit package.
Five billion will be missing next year because of the transfers of money to the benefit of several voters to build highways and railways.
These mainly are already compulsory and dissolved sections that can be reconstructed and, where appropriate, levied.
At most to book, which is also not free.
This means the delay or the halt of thirty large buildings, it is also threatened to draw European money, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD suggested that the loss of money would solve the Solomonian – reaches the ČEZ division that the State owns most of them, and the transport fund will fall.
The problem is, the height of dividends is never sure, and it's no longer about an inappropriate source.
Last year, the CEZ reached the budget of 18 billion.
Each year, the dividend is paid for the liquidation of environmental damage, the pension account is added or used as a reserve for a retirement reform.
In addition, this trick under EU rules increases the actual budget deficit at 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of movements does not end.
Nearly three billion were spent in the budget for various compensation to victims of communism and criminal offences or for the expenses of court disputes, even for building savings.
If it's going to happen without that money, it's not sure.
That's lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we're gonna have to pay for it anyway, he's saying Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or in the worst case to touch the government budget reserve.
A hundred million dollars are also missing for a already-developed two-million-liard Treasury project to allow for online monitoring for what individual authorities spend for.
The first step starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance had not found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, they would come to sanctions, warn Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
The Americans are counting on a mobile phone to the future, on which the user will switch the single button between different operating systems.
Discovered plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the option of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once on your phone.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same time, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year, and a few days ago, he was first presented.
The market will be in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with memory of the RAM of 128 MB, to which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android also operated.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full stream.
Now VMware cooperates with European and American smartphone virtualization operators and the devices should get to customers during 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains suffers from the hotels
Hole conventions don't just worry about the Krkonoše trainers.
The lacking snow discourages people even from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, there are still free rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and Silvestra.
We have a big visitor on our website.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order bindingly.
And if they call us, they're asking if we think this year's Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants a silvestrian stay in Špindler's Mill exactly according to his ideas, says he shouldn't hesitate with the order anymore.
Who prefers saving money and quality of accommodation is in his second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
For now, the Špindlers offer only weekly stays on Silvestra.
I think they're gonna try to fake them for a while, but then they're gonna let them go and go for a shorter time.
And then the rooms will be available fast," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offering the top travel agency Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week that's not sold out yet.
So half the seats in our offer remain free.
That's why we've already set up some cheaper Christmas stays for the last minute," said Director Ingtoursu Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestra in the Giant Mountains can also offer the top travel agency, but the leisures are less.
The first 14 days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that snow is still not in the Giant Mountains.
People wait for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, a little better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms of Horizont in Pec under Sněžka.
We're about five percent better at this.
We've got a few last places on the New Year's Eve for Christmas.
Great interest is about Polish holidays in January and it is well sold February," said Karel Council, director of the best peck hotel.
Of the 80 percent of the silvestrian stays are occupied and the Omnia hotel at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, Christmas remains half of the free beds in the latest Janscoras hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year's January, which we have already taken about 60 percent from now on.
It is a little weaker yet February, but as soon as the snow attacks, the interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly rise, the director of the Omnia Hotel Erik Sporysch said.
However, in the larger part of the snow, the Krkonoše hotelers must have a taste.
It's supposed to cool on Thursday, if there's any precipitation, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then he should come back to the warmth, inform Jiří Jakubský of the castle workplace of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
USA: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It's almost comic, with what kind of schooling effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest one, repeats the Afghan issue of his predecessor's strategy, which he considered to be the dumbest one himself.
When he finally spoiled his long-term afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only in the text itself several times uses the word turning "such as in Iraq" but did not hesitate to even use the name Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
He himself criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq suspicious civil war as "unreasonable and in his consequences a catastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy based on the field leader's recommendation was the only possible and will be successful so much that we are not talking about Iraq today in the news relations.
Bush didn't improve the reputation, but objectively he left his successor a more grateful starting situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military contingent has again been asked by the field commanders, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinate habits, criticized the weighty shooter in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation to a better one.
The president was hesitating for three months, but he didn't think better, so at least he deceived the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to make a promise of another 5,000, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic on the whole of Obam's strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process within three years. The whole Doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half the increase gives the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly wars of the last few years, Iraqi society is relatively well arranged, its leaders of honorary agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by a reverse sign - no one can be relyed on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are prepared to change the master every day, depending on how they're comfortable.
Political institutions, even if they are formally founded, will remain only a quiet village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue.
The exportation of the interests of various ethnic groups is unusually complicated in view of the impartiality of the ratios that are even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even building an "accessible State", which is a minimalist target of the whole operation, does not seem too real.
Obama's strategy's time horizon reflects its Voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened, and now it's on the edge of the explosion.
Believing that the soldiers sending into war crows for the purpose of the "short return home" will cause a miracle made here, only a soul can truly romantic, reality untouched.
From a political point of view, the determination of the data of the withdrawal of troops is an irresponsibility, as Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO Summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is a negative.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy relates to the war in Hinducus underneath.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions on Iran do not impede, a severe question will arise before the United States, whether it is not attempted to solve the military problem by force.
The answer to it will be needed at the time that Obama says America will proceed to the winning download from Afghanistan.
However, every such solution will also mean a dramatic turnover in the Afghanistan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is that there are three years left in the presidential elections, and so there is still enough time to come with another strategy if this turns out to be a total fall.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs won't get paid in cash anymore
High-school leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs won't get paid this year in cash.
It's been reported by a company who's reacting to the sharp critique of her wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive a share instead of money that will be sold first in five years.
In addition, the shares may be taken to managers if they are taking over the risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is facing the end of the effort to connect rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction he needs to be made, said the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticism after she paid off almost $17 billion in the first three quarters of this year (approximately CZK 300 billion) for rewards.
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year according to Reuters, apparently, exceeds 20 billion dollars, despite the reported measure today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political topic in many countries.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that he would wish bankers' bonuses exceeding £25,000 (about CZK 712.000) to leverage one-time 50% taxes.
Similar steps are prepared by France.
This year, women won Nobel's prize in all fields except for physics
The record five women today in Stockholm took over from the hands of the Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf this year's Nobel Prizes in professional categories and literature.
In addition to four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin was Hert Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received two American bioložes Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider together with their krajan Jack Szostak for research in the area of chromosomes.
Israel Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz received the prize for clarification of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate had Nobel's prize for the economy that Americanka Elinor Ostrom and her krajan Oliver Williamson received for the analysis of economic governance.
The only professional categories that traveled this year without a holder were physics.
This price today was taken by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyl for the invention of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Every appreciated diploma, Nobel's medal and profit certificates of financial reward.
For each category, it amounts to 10 million Swedish crowns (about CZK 25 million).
If they are awarded in each of them more, they share the reward between themselves.
Traditionally the most unexpected Nobel Prize for peace was received in the Norwegian Osle this afternoon by President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognised the controversy of his appreciation, because he was only at the beginning of his track and, moreover, he was headed by the country that led two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the defence of his politics, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary for combating peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering demise. Klaus invited him to the Castle.
President Václav Klaus will adopt the Minister of Finance of Eduard Janot on Friday morning, considering the persistence in the government, because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for the next year, as approved by the Chamber of Parliament on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps even Janot's persistence in the cabinet will be topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget criticizes Klaus too.
He believes that he has too high deficits, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
He informed the President's spokesperson Radim Ochvat about the meeting.
Janota wants to talk to Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus now gets to sign, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House, however, agreed on Wednesday, on the left-hand motions to transfer money and increased the money to the salaries of state employees, to the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has identified the proposals for social democracy that secretly increases the deficit of the budget.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, there was a sharp, intra-political dispute that begins to raise the question of the further effect of Fischer's official cabinet on which the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed in spring.
The criticism argues that the budget, as the House adopted, is essentially eliminated by a package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has sold in autumn and which is supposed to stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign, said that politicians for a long time neglected a "great problem", which is a "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He thinks he doesn't have a good solution today.
The improvement could only bring a strong government, which, moreover, could oppose a wider consensus of political parties, refers to the president.
The chairman of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President ODS Petr Nečas said ČTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the greens is clearly not working.
Prime Minister Fischer said in response the same words as "silent statements".
Head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánka, saying that the deficit of the budget was prepared by the former Topolen government for this year, which would exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CNSD has identified the approval of the State Budget for the next year for success.
Humans were also satisfied.
Mandel played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Invictus will tell the world a lot about the earth, its fight and victory despite some critics, that the main roles are being played by American actors.
The story tells about sports, races and Nelson Mandel.
A reckless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa and her first black president Nelson Mandel in his life story is an oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was one-death-year-old Mandela asked if he could play it in Eastwood's film.
Another important role in him is Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have access to you.
For example, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he finally became a slave, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in the Divine Evan, but rarely someone who lives and is as important as Mandela for many people.
Former South African stateman was 27 years in prison for his active work for the completion of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released to freedom in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded Nobel’s price for peace.
Invictus is the Latin word for the un defeated and it is the name of the poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The image is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African ragby team Francoise Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains still racial and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sports, so he decides to unite the players of the Rugby, who belong on a global scale among outsiders.
South Africa will eventually go to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman's been working for several years to get Mandel's story on the canvas.
I had no goal but to play this role so that I could get her closer to the most realistic, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and world policy were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found out that when I print your hand, I take over your energy, it transfers, and I felt I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try to be another person.
Matt Damon is filming Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the National Rugby team in which white players were prevailing.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for his role in the harsh world of ragby.
The big surprise for him was finally when he first met with Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I called on the home doorbell, he opened up to me, and the first thing Françoisi Pienaar said in his life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the distinct differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real ancestors under the leadership of Eastwood, the Invictus has won: The Invictus intreatable positive reviews and are also talking about the ambitions on Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Varieta Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus won 76 percent of the positive ratings.
The mystery of the radius over Norway was deciphered: the Russians tested the rocket
Over Norway, it was possible to observe the special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defence Department only admitted that near the Norwegian borders, an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
But it was a failure again and a bullet called the type "Bulava", which was originally the glory of the Russian army, slowly becomes the black more of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his recurring presence in the missile tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually never flew or damaged in the air.
In the Russian paper, "Bulava" is already written as "a rash that doesn't fly."
Rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This in order was already 13 years old, and it was normal at first.
At the end of the flight, there was again a technical damage to the aparate.
Apparently, the engine blew up in the third degree of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" started from Dmitri Donskij's nuclear submarine, which sailed under the sea of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows a shot from a ship that is in motion and at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by the unfinished flying object was really broken by "Bulava".
Last but not least, Nors have been in doubt about the Russian rocket since the first time.
The generals are defending themselves this time and claiming that failure cannot be clearly spoken.
The first two levels of missiles lasted and the accident hit three.
In previous cases, the engines broke right in the first degree.
Even though no mistake was made, only six out of the 13 of the Ministry of Defence is considered to be failing.
Almost 50 percent success is therefore fulfilling the generals with optimism and so still claiming that "Bulava" will once fly without problems and that he will even take up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will be introduced again in 51 years in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and the Stanley Cupu holder will assist in the need of his CSKA Moskva team and will probably be in the Friday duel of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who ended his career in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to deal with some formalities, quoted by the AP to the coaches of the Sergei Germanov Club.
So far, it's not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey will only be one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, said German.
Fetisov thus according to AP in case of returning to ice will become the oldest Russian professional hockey.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe in 1980 and assigned 15 goals and 26 asians.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockeys of history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold, seven titles of the world master, triumphed on Canada Cupu and junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he collected successes in the NHL, where in the Detroit jersey he raised twice over Stanley Cup's head.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai responded to unions.
The headquarters of the Hyundai car agreed to cancel all overtime with the union.
Just because of the often scheduled overtime, the unions reported an emergency on Monday.
He confirmed the spokesman of Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the experts for one Saturday shift.
We cannot resign our production plan, this is essential, so it was proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December, with two shifts to be made, said Vaněk.
The server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who are working Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
That's what people get back to work on Saturday 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way of motivating employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they have paid their surcharge for overtime or they can choose their spare leave on December 28th, and by the end of the day they extended the Christmas holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition, all the staff of the Saturday shift will get paid for a ride and lunch.
Since the overtime was the most urgency and most spicy point in terms of the comments and complaints of professionals, even protesting employees, since they stopped production lively last week, the manager decided to immediately cancel all overnights for December last afternoon, said Vaněk.
The automotive staff were forced to work a two-hour overtime by virtually every day after an eight-hour change.
After the signature of the agreement, the Stage Emergency Units shall withdraw
Further discussions between car managers and professionals are to be held on Friday morning.
The head of the union Petr Kuchař on Wednesday said that if they agreed to meet the requirements and sign a common document, they are ready to cancel the stand.
The situation in the car went out last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees had spontaneously stalled due to constant overtime.
They also tested against bad pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management has proposed that overtime must be carried out by employees in order to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
Experts in their Monday notice also demanded that they were not sanctioned by workers who discontinued production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime unions, they require the company to mitigate the overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want to pay 5,000 crowns for it.
The Hyundai Nošovice car now employs 2,000 people.
The company started the serial production last November.
By this September, it produced approximately 80.000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on HIV-obtrusive viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This is in some cases overwhelmed by the fact that the compound does not act as strong as some of the drug already available.
The disease of AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, patients may considerably prolong the life of a mixture of medicines that prevent HIV multiplying in their body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the multiplication of the virus is also due to the development of so-called residual viruses that are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, from VŠCHT Praha and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metal carbohydrates are active in proteins responsible for multiplying HIV virus.
Metal carbohydrates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the medicines used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new “better” compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metal carbohydrates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages formed by boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are connected with a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and durable virus
HIV protease is HIV protein which is necessary for the viral life cycle.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV grafting, mature viral particles would not occur.
If we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, they explain scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected with a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the test and also against its resistant (resistent) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metal carbohydrates on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, but its effect does not lose for resistant variants against which medications are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other characteristics such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical modifications, thus making interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, Head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS went to Fischer, he's defending himself.
Chief of ODS Mirek Topolánek has identified an approved budget for the next year for "scaring" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS expressed strong statements by the Prime Minister.
He says he's keeping time to analyze.
Vice-President ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly not working.
According to Netime, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to resist a minority in the House, which is to combat the growing deficit, or to maintain his function with the use of the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy's approach to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, pointed out Nečas.
On Wednesday the House adopted the 2010 budget, but with the left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House has increased the money to salaries of state employees, to the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's goal at the address of social democracy's proposals was that they secretly increase the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so she met the wishes of the government that the amended budget was less a bad option than the budget provizorium.
disappointment and vanity
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still assess the current situation.
Time is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave the office in the event of adoption of amendments, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota ordered himself on Monday after the government to the Prime Minister.
He suggested that he considered further persistence in his function.
Its disappointment in the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer speaks for the next fight with the deficit of the budget, they do not have anything in the government to do with the nominants of the ČSSD, which made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that it will give demission if the House approves further legislation on increasing deficits, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or a new service law.
Topolánek: Ministers Nominated ODS were not guilty
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated ODS did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in the text report from the US.
He recalled that several ministries have been voted against the budget in the deputy functions of the people reporting to TOP 09.
In time, he pointed out that if Fischer decided to resign to the principle of fighting the rise of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he would oppose the leftmost that is currently in the House".
Then he says he can't count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to date, I'll take care of it, he told the journalists in the Chamber of Defense Minister Martin Barták, whom civil Democrats just nominated to the government.
Prime Minister Fischer went to the meeting of the European Council in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister ODS has resigned
In the absence of time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote in favour of the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister of the Civil Democrats had not explicitly requested the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, but he responded to whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget did not burden the absence of the President of the Party in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Since I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolsheeving of the House and the destruction of all positive, he responded himself to Topolánek.
According to the new ČD order, less trains will go for almost the same ride
Since 13 December, the Czech tracks will cancel or limit some of the less busy fasteners and locations, other connections will strengthen.
The total transport range shall be reduced from the date of validity of the new schedule by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer rides, will not change.
For example, Ostrava residents will receive more possibilities of connection to the capital, and the routes to this line add one pendolino set.
Railway stops driving to Bratislava.
Less speeders will also go on the line Prague - Písek - Český Budějovice, a direct connection of Prague - Letohrad will be limited.
The regions are planning the largest reduction in transport in the Královéhradecké kraji, a total of eight percent, on the increase can be enjoyed by Prague and the surroundings.
There are also two night trains on Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and several quick trains on the line Prague - Písek - Český Budějovice is limited to only some days per week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today Milovičtí are to be transferred to Lysé over the Lab.
It is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electricity from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will be completed at the destination station Praha Hlavní nádraží.
The ČD will introduce multiple SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jesenik in two-hour intervals.
Pendoline to Bratislava will no longer be driven by passengers from December 13th.
This year's Regional Railway Account: 200 million more
The speeds order and pay the Ministry of Transport, total of the so-called proven losses will give to the expensive next year four billion crowns, just like this year. The locals order the countries, total pay eight billion crowns for them next year, with a total of three billion countries to contribute to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The train tracks and speeders have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always for one year.
Railways commend the system, therefore apparently, did not reach an increase in the price of the violating majority of tickets.
The changes will only take place in the day-to-day ČD Net tickets and the cheap eLiška web tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will be renewed from a detached distance, so far it has been united for the journey between any city of the region and has amounted to 160 crowns.
The Philippines are still holding over 50 people, the children are free.
The armor today in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several pupils of the primary school and their teachers.
The AFP Agency, which initially informed only of 65 abducted.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 soldiers say they use hostages as a live shield in escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, arms belong to the New People's Armed Force (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP Agency, the police originally persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence required to hold accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was declared state law.
30 journalists were among the victims of the massacre of 23 November relating to the elections to the Governing Office.
For suspected participant in the massacre was arrested by the Governor of this South African province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influenced Ampatuan family.
On the island of Mindanao are also active Muslim separatists.
But they have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of the JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Unguarded), which captures part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandely.
The role of a world-famous fighter against apartheid was made by Morgan Freeman, who said he chose Mandel for his performance years ago.
Matt Damon took the next male role of the legendary South African champion in rugby Francoise Pienaara.
With a picture in the cinema, it comes from voices of critics and public
Nelson Mandela
The whole name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the South African Mvez.
In 1988, Sacharov received the prize for freedom of thought, and in 1993, with de Klerk Nobel's peace prize.
The President of the South Africa was in 1994-1999.
Large expectations, as it comes to the public at a time in South Africa, however, at the peak of preparations for the world championship in football, but at the same time the media shakes an alarming report on rising racial hatred and discrimination by the black government.
According to the AP's intelligence agency, the new film in JAR is positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations on the occupancy of the main roles of the Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of his words for a new film.
I've dreamed of the role for years and prepared for it well.
Many times I met with Nelson Mandela to, as they say, draw his energy, put in a conversation after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remind Mandel's personality and message by the film.
It's a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it's about every person, he added.
In the jersey of the national team rugby
A picture based on the book predecessor of British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of enemy: Nelson Mandel and the game that gave the nation portraits the South African human rights supporter during his first presidential election period.
Thus, Morgan Freeman tries to stem two race groups and for many years to each other, as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, also enters into an acting role in the South African national rugby jersey at the World Cup field that JAR won.
For the entrance to the lawn in a jersey, which is understood in JAR almost as something sacred, Mandel cleaned up a large era for 14 years ago, mostly a white audience and gained the recognition of the white people.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people into one nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in JAR improves, it will only show up.
However, the White South Africans are sceptic, as the example of the recent LN interview revealed by the fan of rugby Christopher Dawson, who escaped from the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on 11 June 2010.
In Lousk, the transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the fire was captured by the Čep transformer in a divorce near the village of Vyškov in Lounsk.
In the fire, he intervenes according to the spokesman of the regional firemen of Luke Marvan, six units.
Originally, firemen wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reassessed the view and the fire of a mixture of fire, foams and special firefighters.
The reason was the technical failure, the internal shortening of the transformer.
No one was injured, a crash according to the spokesman of Paula Mandata does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few dozen million crowns, and it will be precisely calculated until the fire is over.
Destroyed transformer according to Mandate will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years, the operation of the Czech Republic has not happened, the faults of this type are isolated, supplemented.
According to the spokesman of the ČEZ company for North Bohemia Soni Holinger Hendrych was not affected by the operation of households, offices or fire fires of trafostanice.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformers converting electrical energy from transmission to distribution system and routes of a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura shall submit a criminal notice for the homicide at three flocks from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Janchura will present a criminal announcement for the homicide at three socio-democratic flocks today.
And to Michal Haška of the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubický region and the hejtman of Olomouck, Martin Tesařík.
Janchura said it in 20 minutes of RadioJournal.
The application relates to the efforts of the company to operate regional train transport in certain regions.
But in the end, all regions have signed long-term contracts with Czech roads.
All three flocks attack us and they're talking about picking raisins, and we've only offered what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech tracks, which is not true, because we know the Czech road prices that were closed last week.
So we don't have to defend ourselves.
It's for a talk against the Student Agency, said Radiojaurnale Janchura.
At the same time, he said that he had evidence from all regions that they did not take steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares the initiative for the European Commission.
The hack to submit a criminal notice considers it to be another continuation of Mr. Janchura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own.
Obviously, I am ready to defend the good name of my country and I will invite the other flocks to the same thing.
I assume that, even on this occasion, it is clear that Mr Janchura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura has announced that he has invested several million crowns in a commercial that will be reminded of a disadvantaged step in the regions.
The radio jurornale said that the campaign would break after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He underlined that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jančura after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech roads and did not write tendencies on the contract of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura, an anti-legal act is similar and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
In view of the critique of train transport in the regions, Jančurus was already threatened by the MEP for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't, we could lose our bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know what the master is about, I won't say his name, said today Radiojaurnale Janchura.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination since January will be broken by habits.
It should be the first to be free and optional for families.
But the voices are already called to be more effective vaccination.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus peaks.
The medical institution already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that they pay for health insurance companies.
Experts are already clear in the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free Vaccines for August children
Since January, they may be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal children who were born last August 2nd and later.
The condition is that they haven't had one dose of vaccination.
Who began to vaccinate last year or before, has to pay for another vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of child age.
She volunteered to keep her children vaccinated against a quarter of the pneumococcal families last year.
Parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed when vaccination of youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will issue 300 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccination.
But he'll save it for the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, he gave about 500,000 a year for all child plural vaccinations.
The vaccination was induced by a so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcal inflammations of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain blades and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infection in us will die per year according to the investigation in hospitals up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children were vaccinated in 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, however, it appears that this vaccination could be compulsory in the future.
Since January it is to be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the head of the civilian association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský suggested that the mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has been propagating for a long time.
Experts at the international conference that our associations participated were not quite satisfied with our voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly perfect.
On the other hand, we're glad that we managed to settle for at least this.
I think that's the way we've got to go now, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Srszeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, claims doctors
Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Children’s Doctors Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that she has voluntary vaccination of her disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, they could consider reducing the number of vaccinations "For the situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," however, Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect to let their infants vaccinate against pneumococcals from next year more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is a breakthrough, even in the fact that it is the first child vaccination to the health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance should spend money on prevention, save it for further treatment, explain Cabrnoch.
Physicians will have to buy their own substances.
However, this involves the concern of practical paediatric physicians relating to the shopping of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to buy insurance companies and the doctors would receive them similarly as the state supplys them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some Members feared that insurance companies could "supply health insurance money".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy substances and wait for insurance to pay them back.
According to estimates, individual practical paediatric doctors will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is an important sum.
It won't be easy, she says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist's stealing in a museum.
The son of a renowned American fantastic artist Frank Frazett was accused of attempted image robbery of $20 million (12 million) of his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his car and trailer.
The appointed Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to break into a musea in the Poconco Mountains bagr.
Mr. Frazetta senior, the age of 81, was famous for creating Barbara Conan and Tarzan's figure.
At the time when it happened, the artist was located in Florida, as the Associated Press press said.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Mr. Frazetta was younger to be motivated by long-lasting family disputes.
Before the police, Mr. Frazetta issued the younger stringent statement, age 52, that he had done so on the instructions of his father, "to get into museum in any way possible and relocate the paintings into the sweetening space," as the Agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior denied granting any such permission as the Agency said.
Labourists defend the planned increase in taxation
The Ministers defended the increase in taxation and the cut of expenditure notified in the preliminary report on the budget against the criticism by opposition, entrepreneurs and unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tory's "missed" possibility to show that they are seriously deferring the decision to reduce the deficit for the time after the elections.
Even the Chancellor got fired because of the disabilities of low and medium-sized workers.
According to its proposal, the increase in 0.5% in social insurance and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011 is mainly the same.
Susceptibility regarding social insurance
The departments protested that the low-income workers were punished for the recession they did not commit and warned against the "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is about 3 billion pounds per year - which has distorted the community of entrepreneurs who have said that this is a employment tax while it should be focused on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limiting the revenue of more than 20000 pounds per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PBR CLOSES
Social insurance shall be increased by another 0,5 % since April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75% in this year
New tax 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Increasing 1% of tax to companies for depreciation in small companies
Reducing the tax on electric cars and wind power plants
Increased measurement of pensions by 2.5 %
According to the State Financial Administration estimate, some revenues of £3000 will be reduced by £90 per year and some revenues of £40000 will be reduced by £190 while some income of £1000 will be increased by £10.
The Ministers announced that their deficit reduction target by half of 2013 means "sufficient decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of the highest income.
The Minister of Finance Stephen Timms denies that the proposed increase in taxes and costs would be "capture in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"There are big numbers, which will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is the absolute basic requirement for the next four years," said BBC.
Mr Timms said that he is convinced that the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But drawing up the forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor was forced to revise the earlier amounts.
In its opinion, the decline in the economy was 4,75% - much worse than the decline of 3.5%, foreseen in April - because loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Lost Opportunities'
Conservatives who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning the "rise of debt" of workers, marked the planned loan of 789 billions of pounds in the next six years as unnecessary..
Ministers failed to present a credible plan, as it could be paid, added, "cynics" postponed this decision until the elections - which must take place until June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said the Shadow Minister of Finance Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they lost it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tory's proposals, who would like to reduce deficits faster and to a larger extent.
But liberal Democrats claim that money obtained by increasing taxes and cutting expenses should be used to support expenditure in the next year and not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "deposited to sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said about the timing of the communication - such as the above inflation will increase and there will be a inability to pay the benefits in the next April - that this could lead to an accusation by the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money was hardly recovered by a year later.
But workers insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspicious Budget'
Although the Ministers did not disclose the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economic operators stated that it is clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budgetary Studies stated that Chancellor's ciphers suggest significant cuts in many areas, potentially in budocno include transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the elections, if we win them," Roger Bootle, the economic consultant of Deloitt's accounts.
"It was a report on the suspicious preliminary budget, the market is implementing it."
The FBI is investigating in the 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating in Pakistan's prison in five American suspects of interconnection to extremists.
Men were imprisoned for attacking the house in Sargoda in the province of East Panjab, as the BBC of the American embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI told me that this was an investigation of whether they were the same men who were declared missing in the last month in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign reports that it is also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them say that they are the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said that the agency was informed of imprisonment and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washgington said that men were arrested in a house that belongs to an uncle of one of them.
It pointed out that the house was always the center of the interest of the local police and that there was no objection to arrested men.
The Ministry of Foreign Hillry Clinton refused to comment on arrest, told the Reuters press agency, but said that the United States had to "collaborate much more closely with Afghan and Pakistan in expanding the infrastructure of terrorism, which is continuing to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
A rejection of amnesty for Iranian abused people.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as the last 20 years, as reports Amnesty International.
The report describes in detail the "goods of torture" in the mode before and after disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was bitten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
The officials called this criticism politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were trapped and tens of them were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmúd Ahmadine demanded, leading to the biggest street demontrations from the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were imprisoned and the prosecutors sentenced the last five persons to death.
The BBC writer in Tehran John Leyne, now located in London, said that earlier in the protests the High Leader of Ayjatoláh Alí Chomejní declared the illicitness of certain ways of torture and forbidden their implementation in the Karizak remedy facility.
But since then, almost no critiques of lawful power have been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
Untrue confession'
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old computing student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with the Facebook network" and for protests against the results of the elections.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in the statement.
"They fired me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days he signed an untrue confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the elections and tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
The U.S. officials denied the rape charges, but they admitted there was torture.
Amnesty also referred the case to the former prisoner who said he was held in a container with other 75 persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Irish Parliament and Justice have set up committees for the investigation of election disturbances and government responses, but has stated that the mandate and powers of the authorities have been unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees have been published.
The group stated that at least 90 persons were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
There was a ski slope in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform the monument in Bristol in the conventional track for the race.
The conventional race path in the park attracted 16 half-professional skiers and snowbordists to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the conventional track at Brandon Hill Park, a short jump bridge 100 m long conventional track.
A student of the fourth year of medicine, John Hickman, said it was a wonderful view from the top of the conventional track, but that it was really skating.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowbordists from all over the country - some of them were real talents," he added.
The prices were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the conventional track.
After a quarterly evening race, the snow was left to melt.
They and we still
Could he be Muslim French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At the time when the Swiss voters called after the ban on the construction of the minarets and in general the alarm reports on the alleged islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed and thought about whether the Muslims could integrate themselves - and whether they integrate - into one of the most open secular companies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirable of the author's last work, "Why French do not like scarves on the head" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of disputed questions that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose impacts are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the foundation.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now take care of 5  & 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls the Islamic Spaces.
He's a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on issues that are most concerned about them.
Should Muslim enter a marriage union in a mosque or a town hall (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gay people?
Can Muslim marry a man who is not Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if she wants to get a mortgage?
These seemingly contested worldly questions are discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than political drama that employ the media.
The author identifys a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, does not identify Tarika Ramadana, Araba, Muslim researcher and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is attempting to open a discussion on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society at the same time.
They don't have arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are unfaithful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The Philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interviewed are acknowledged to the house that they are against Selafi—the favours of the puristic Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia—the group is a small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes the Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
The question is how far French politicians are (and intellectual elita, which so arputile defends the laic public) are truly devoted to the ideas of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims have probably less experience in faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republic.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he discovered "touching screws of values".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most unhappy prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatic than the other environment of the planet.
The ice is a alarming speed, which affects the animals and its survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
Richard Ellis, a writer and an illustrator, faces the natural history of the icons of the North, the Polar Bear.
Well-known with complicated history and velrybism procedures describes the long tradition of polar researchers who tried to defend the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a bold 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musket collar is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who swim behind their mother's bodies were captured and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in one circus tent.
Even today, the gardens in the zoo have typically a million times smaller area than the area that adults have available in the wilderness. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Even though hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter and Indians are hunted on skis and all are armed with powerful attacking arms to shoot their prey.
Ironic is that it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of the New Scientist, offers a clear and unhappy responsibility for science for Arctic and a tied-up summer view of how the future can change it.
Not everything scientists have answers.
Even the meteorologists and oceanographers have no adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of tests.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century indicated for the first time how the ice flow occurs.
The submarines of the Cold War then maped the shifting divisions when they were sailing.
Satellite survey and large field probes in floating ice ice cubes are a useful supplement, but many are still done thanks to unthreatening individuals, camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into the extremely fragile world of the falldown system inside the Arctic ice, formed by the steaking of saltwater that stinks in the freezing.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic miracles in it, it is all condemned to destruction once the summer ice is moved, which will happen sometimes between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that could be us.

Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple prisoner to the grave of a soldier, with whom he never met.
For him and the other members of the naval infantry who took a trip from the camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, that was the day they gave up to men and women who once wore the same footwear.
In a few months when we board, it could be us, Robinson said about fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I'm trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put the vest on the cemetery veterans in several departments at the foot act in Arlington.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's burial company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and a few others decided to decorate a few hundred graves in the underground act in Arlington.
It is now 18 years old tradition, when Mr nMorill and his wife Karen are taking this journey every year and stops in different cities along the road to honor the memory of the members of the army and the victims of terrorism.
Worcestesters don't look for profits across America, which are found in other states.
In this year, volunteers put more than 16,000 currencies on the Arlington cemetery, in the Pentagon territory, on graves at the National Cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the memorial flight site of 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart's Foundation has devoted more than $150000 to the purchase and transport of currencies.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she took a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a deceased armed member.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to recover what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Inclined in the coat of a hot substance, volunteers walked through a cemetery in the surrounding grass and hills.
Volunteers headed for the elders from the first and second world war and the war in Vietnam because these are not visited as often as the newer graves
The attitude was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they transported the young gravestones to scorched stones.
Every circular vertebrae was darkly green with a small red arch of hair top part.
Near the section 60, where most veterans from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan remained truly silent.
The service organisations devoted 1000 decorators to decorating the department, but the cloudy mood of the ongoing wars was filled with this area.
Some were frankly crying, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read the names out loud, made into stones, while others bowed to look at the small black and white name tags, pushed into the wet breeze where the tombstones were not yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears out of their son's grave.
She went eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Navy Marine Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, said.
"I want to be the one to remember him, even though I've been gone a long time."
American government supplier trapped by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned a U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. with its registered office in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the American Interest Section in Havana, sought access to a detained, who was imprisoned on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been published, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is called "unsafe".
All so-called counter-revolutional activities, including mild protests and critical stats, create a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speeches are considered to be serious offences.
There is a young blogger community in Cuba, led by a popular commentator named Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take the prices, but the permit was denied.
The arrest of the American supplier may be due to the growing tension between the Communist Castr brother, ruler in Cuba, and Obama administration, which has been followed as a "continuation tactics" in improving relations with the island.
The first report on New York Times was on Friday night.
The new American policy underlined that if the Cuban government took concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more opposition space, the associated States will take the reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and searched commodities in the country where the average salary of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has given ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; they are mostly used to send text-list messages because a 15-minute call would cost more than one daily wage.
Using the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
The Cubans who often want to log in must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The arrest of the American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in Cuba prison are behind bars for trespassing, such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbenová, the press office of the Section for American interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
Prisons and arrests were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - deprive the free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, Miguel Vivanco, the director of the American Human Rights Appreciation Programme, which recently published an unfavourable report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the Tattoo Kuba," as an insult to the installation of Raula Castra as leader of the country and the replacement for the deadly older brother Fidela.
Vivanco said that the defendants were often arrested, judged and imprisoned in one day.
He pointed out that all the solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government has often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just when these two countries are heading towards a wider dialogue.
Pakistani state administration staff cover up a conspiracy concerning the passing of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities discovered a alleged conspiracy leader on Saturday about sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the American forces, and said that they hoped that this case could help to cover a large network of terrorist verbals that scramble on the Internet and search for radicalized young men.
The investigators said that they were searching for the grey rebel personalities known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after they first discovered them when one of these men published a comment, approving terristic attacks has an online YouTube video service.
Saifillah took the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, tried to help them get into the distant area of Pakistan in the border of the native tribes of Pakistan, which is the home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer, who filed the case report, said on Saturday that Saifulláh was unsuccessful in conviction of the commanders of al-Qaida and that men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for a few days to the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the threatful mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered to be a strike unit.
That's why they were blown out, the official who spoke about maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain consent to obtain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the performance of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which has remained in Pakistan and has been questioned by the FBI - stresses the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, determining who is trusted.
Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the American intelligence service assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in Al-Qaeda.
Organization recruiters work as guardians, exclude those who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to the holy war and those who could be explorers.
The American false recruits were subjected to a special examination of al-Qaeda, indicated by analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because due to their potential access to the US goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the NEFA Foundation with its headquarters in the US, said that the terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years, allowing the coke to join them because the US intelligence agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way to follow their recruitment model, which has already been watched so much? said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding a climate action.
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday and demanded stronger action on climate from the negotiators in the Bella City Congress Center.
The protesters reported the number of many hundreds of participants in this event, but the police overlooked that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists put a few small loads close to a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day the minor event occurred in the talks about the climate that the United Nations sponsored, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried transparents with the English inscriptions "This is not the planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, who said "the Earth says "the dnot".
The protest took part in several celebrities including Danish models and photographers Heleny Christensen, who said she was traveling to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information on the unhappy state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still happening.
That's a partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- passing through the world and appealing to the leaders of the world to make a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to do it, it's still impossible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from approaching Bell's center and claiming that they were arrested by 19 people, first of all, because they were either wearing masks or wearing pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited in accordance with the Danish law during demonstration.
According to one of the non-participating viewers who do not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate mills, activists masked as athletes and in black outfits have laid several loads near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at buildings, said, started with lights, but then followed "some big explosions."
Inside the Congress Center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
However, the protest probably did not intervene with key officials, such as Su Wei, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether the demonstrations had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he answered English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (i.e. it really is something I don't realise).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of everyone.
It is seen the concentration of the general public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change, said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the negotiations or the freedom of others.
The data of the test revealed constantly persistent race differences
The Federal Certificate from the past week on the knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news on the public education district Columbia.
Although the district is far behind high performance systems of the country, the certificate has shown greater progress in the fourth and eight classes in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last numbers of the National Atesting Centre for Progress in Teaching is the persistent differences in the knowledge achieved between African Americans and white students both local and national.
The average result of the white pupils of the fourth classes of Columbia district in the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but only three points in their African-American layers, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth class remains essentially balanced, with a statistically irrelevant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the results of the test as the size of the sample was not sufficiently large.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils of fourth grades in 2003, when the first NAEP was made in the precinct, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in both groups during this period has improved, the difference has barely reached 58.
Some of the advocates of education in the precinct expressed in the last week that the results, celebrated by the secrets of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were more extensively stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the sum of the support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group defending the equality of vocation in the precinct.
I'm not jumping up and down because of the dispersion of two or three points, said a member of D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the primary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee's style, Mrs Brown said that the report on the results of the test means high school in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the hammers and I respect it.
But what's terrifying is that we haven't spent almost any time and energy that was needed to give to our middle education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the efforts of the precinct are to continue looking for better ways, focused on the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new curriculums, Wilson’s reading system, focused on higher classes of primary schools and high school students, who have failed to handle the foundations of reading earlier in their collar careers, are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics and curriculum of mathematics into the sixth grade, emphasizing games and experience of real life, which came into the precinct as former director of Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the progress made by NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and do the best of interventions with those students who stay below the class level, said Mrs. Rhee.
The others said that the NAEP results explained whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall system performance and continue to provide additional money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain won dilemma Mrs Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where he studied the results of the tests in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus the resources and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of Columbia District.
Thus, the focus can bring political responses to an important agenda.
But it is also for other city directors who are trying to maintain the median ratio between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to make the family of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to provide excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now the head of the schools in Newark, said this week in the interview that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the presidency to carry out the rightfulness of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr Janey, who contracted with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which is considered a "remark" to find a higher increase in the next year.
To make higher education part of a better future
The bus drives into the Gettysburg Railway with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, appeared and acted for a moment on white columnh, brick facades and smaragd green grass..
Gracieli's parents barely graduated from El Salvador.
So far, Graciela alone, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the ground of college.
Now she and the other eighth class students in the group examined Gettysburg, where schools amounted to 38690 dollars a year, their position was rather than a frightened visitor enthusiastic students.
Yes! That's it! She called Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, she was really saying thoughtfully when they told them a low-proportioned professors to students.
The Pennsylvanese railway was one of the seven who visited on their three-day tour and were now fully taken into account the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the track.
The question is from where.
However, this is a high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high schools or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who get trained and then enter high-school classes.
In fact, five of this "duty generation" of Spanish pupils from the track - remarkable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrants parents, most of the Mexicans and the people of Central America, have arrived in the United States without finishing their college.
Their story of success is important, they report researchers because it underscores their point of way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the field of the labour force of the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural inclination to school and indigenous congestion and effort to succeed.
Many parents also had high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programmes also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciel and millions of children who would like to graduate in college - especially if these attempts remain in time.
If we look at the fact that I'm taking children from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them to disorient themselves in the system, any simple intervention at each individual point, says Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from Latin America.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school network in all ways to go to college.
The Federal Programme, which financed the tour of Graciela on tracks, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (approved) provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local education systems for the launch of traineeship programmes, starting for students from groups with small income in high schools and continue until these students finish high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of which have entered the college, according to the data of the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Notwithstanding the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to make significant oil companies reconstruction of their infancy infrastructure during two auctions which took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have concluded the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies, which suggests that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in restoring Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of wars and sanctions.
The American companies have left with their equity participation in two of the 10 dumped fields.
Seven American companies paid for the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one has submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on the field that was slew in June.
It was surprising that American oil giants participated in the open Iraqi oil industry.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of the American companies you have in the way of Asian and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It's gonna be a long time before anything else is in Iraq for sale.
The fears of safety, emphasized by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the download of the American army, are likely to discourage American companies from much more intense business in Iraq, which is proven to have the third largest raw material reserves, they say analysts.
The US companies were in some cases in disadvantages, in particular the Chinese and other controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more vulnerable to risking because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies that concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in previous years, have left with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts which were allocated at the end of this week.
The State National Petroleum Corp participated in offerings for more contracts than all other companies and left with great shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic as well as the technological force, said the minister of the oil industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
Companies which have been pre-selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry by price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output over the current level in each field.
Al-Qaida's spider planner was probably killed in Pakistan.
At the impact of the American missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, the top planner of the al-Qaeda operations was probably killed as announced on Friday by the officials of the American counterterrorist department.
As confirmed, it could be a second fatal attack on one of the greatest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several missiles arrived on a quarter of their car near Miran Sáh in the province of Sevverní Vaziristan, according to American resources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have learned that missiles have been launched from an aeroplane without a type crew with which the CIA operates in the band of illegal native tribes.
They were led to a white car, which was headed to the Afghanistan border when it was hit, the official said along with the Pakistani civilian intelligence agency that telephoned from Miran Šah.
The official said that the local armies came to the point and they seized quickly what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the victim's identity, but two American anti-terrorist officials quoted an unspecified witness that said Somalia was a poi of death.
Somali was named as a highly built-in planner for military operations of al-Qaeda, which operated terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in renovation around the world, said a higher official who doesn't want to be appointed, showing the sensitive nature of American air strikes in the Pakistani territory.
If he held a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaida's highest leadership and based on them he planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another American official said that Somali was moving fast in the hierarchy of al-Qaida and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a common-known person for some Americans, but in no way did he humiliate himself to pose before us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second highly built leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban, who should be killed from September when in a similar attack, Najmudin Jalolov was killed, the leader of the militant fraction in the band of the native tribes and three other top leaders of the opperative leaders.
The darkness of attacks, launched by the CIA by unmanned aeroplanes, has declined from around six operations per month to two, according to the Long War logbook, websites managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have reason for improved terror groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also killing people who were suspected to be informants, said the website.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
The U.S. top delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday, that he would want to resign from his office in March and thus end a stormy term of office, which was dreamed of a large corruption charge in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure occurs because Obama's administration decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Delegation said that he supported an increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a reduction in the state that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO States to withdraw their powers.
We need to accelerate the building of the Afghanistan security forces and send the right signal to Afghanistan that they have confidence in the international community, told Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment to be accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and the other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he didn't resign, but he simply fulfilled the promise that he gave his family in March 2008, that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report the UN.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now said that he would need time to find the refund.
As I said, it's about time to look after the successor, Eid said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials Ban, he started searching for a refund.
The officials said that it is decided between Staffan di Mistura, who has Swedish-Hitalian origin and has previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, the French, who conducted the United Nations Peace Operation before that.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzaim, who won in the country's presidential elections from masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said that Galgraith's charges -- which was released -- "the mission certainly damaged, because there was a high degree of scepticism in terms of international intervention" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed a meeting with the Supreme Representative of citizens in order to coordinate the ease of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them for the Afghan mission, as he says, to strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment in limiting its efforts in Afghanistan and said that the UN's heavy hiring regulations undermine its ability to exploit its skills.
The UN rules are that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person since May, said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces other sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's power will soon impose on Iran's " further significant sanctions" due to lack of engagement in interviews about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a weekly journey in areas where they were fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, was experiencing the prospects of armed events against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, he answered the soldier's question for probable development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I learned about something from Iraq in the past six years, [this] is an irresponsible incredibility in the war.
Obama’s administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the ordinary Iraqis.
He said that "the balloon of incentives and obstacles" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer exceptionally" by sanctions.
According to the fifth opinion published by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration involved the European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop his expertise only for peace purposes.
In interviews in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his stocks of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgent fuel needed for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has been set up for such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to obtain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems that Iran is departing from the provisional agreements - partly because it is because the IRA leadership is divided in the opinion of whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, if it concerns Irish hardship to the international community in the case of some proposals that he actually agreed to in the beginning of October, I think that it brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a road that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which was once called "degrading sanctions" by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In its opinion, issued in New York, the Iranian United Nations Mission condemned on Thursday what she called "unfounded and unfounded charges" before some members of the Iranese Nuclear Security Committee and said that she wanted to continue to talk with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to Kurdistán, rich in oil to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish leaders in Ireland.
The high tension between Kurda and Iraq is maintained by the majority of the Arab, in particular due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both parties to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to prevent the retention of the U.S. plans to limit the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to suppress the Kurdish concern of persistent depression. The official places of the United States quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaam, President of the Kurdist regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "The mother of the Earth is too exhausted to use more children" and "One child also means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when the official government seats in Shanghai were alarmed by low births and ageing populations in their city, she suddenly changed the course in this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn't keep anything for the other, says Wang, 31 years, the human resource manager who has an 8-month son.
For more than 30 years, the lasting politics of China have only one child has been established and thereby created two generations only of the notoriously boubled and laminated children, and the country is threatening the population crisis.
The average birth rate decreased to 1.8 children to a couple compared to six than they put into force in the UN data.
The population, where the population aged 60 and higher is predicted to increase from 16.7 percent in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the total average of around 20 percent.
Inequality is more rich coastal cities with population with higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, the 60s and the higher were almost 22 percent in Shanghai of registered populations, while birth was less than one child for a couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning said, many couples must have children to help reduce the proportions of ageing population and reduce the number of labour in the future.
He says it's about being old doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Progressive calmdown
As it was introduced into the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party Government today.
Doubles who violated politics faced huge fines -- three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
The Chinese official places promoted policies that helped the country to prevent critical exploitation of natural resources while human rights defenders were condemned in promoting policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many pairs had to be sexually selected abortions, leading to an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, population officials were gradually milder in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, they normally authorised exceptions - including the population of cities, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were singles -- and in 2007 they mitigated the dictation of their passwords, promoting a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials were already discussing more radical changes as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was a single child.
In June Šanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign for inciting more births.
Almost overnight there were posters, demanding parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, specifying how it would be right to have a second child and how to ask for permission.
The city administration sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and move flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the officials said for family planning.
Smuggling Response
Even though the officials in one rural town in the vicinity of Šanghaj have seen an increase in interest in pairs who would like to have a second child after the launch of the campaign, most city circles did not report changes.
Huinan City District with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases a month.
The disappointed officials in Shanghai said that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai Quarter of Caol, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she would like two children, and it was legally allowed to them.
But as many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a doctrine network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west judge the politics of one child as a contested legal question, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in a seventh month of pregnancy in a relationship with the first child.
Yes, we were deprived of a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples show psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child, because she was also the only child: "We were the center of our families' attention and we were all caring for us.
We were not used to provide care and in fact we didn't want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old translating company, expressed this much uncovered.
For two-care parents from middle-class, who reduced birth, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-old adults look at their parents as the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and don't want this way of living for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands for parents' time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still disputed questions of the prop -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You must have resume prepared at the time when the child is 9 months for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to be happy with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has set up a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far undisclosed attitudes and mutual seals -- has again focused on the release of a document on Friday, which proposes ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, with most of the burdens in the near term.
The text, which can provide an exit for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, stresses the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was an important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN working group ad hoc, this text inevitably states how much money the rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming short and long term.
And it provides a wide range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage the upcoming economies so that they can reduce their carbon output and what the upper limit should be to the rise of global temperatures that political players will still be able to to tolerate.
This will provide a large dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the head of the Washington Club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-story document, of the 180 pages of the text from the negotiations to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a "great picture".
It sets out the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union has discussed accelerated on Friday a promise to provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries to adopt adaptation to climate change -- from flooding and drought to prevent deforestation.
But on Friday, he said the same kind of verbal fireworks that were considered during the interviews last week.
The U.S. Special Embassy on Climate Matt Stern rejected the speech, requiring binding greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries in comparison with the voluntaryness of the main emerging economies, unless they were financed by the developed world.
The ruling signaled that Obama’s administration reached a tougher line towards China, the officials of Bush’s administration just two years ago.
The United States will not come to a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign He Yafei told the U.S. main negotiator on climate issues that either lack of "self reason" or "mimore irresponsibility" led earlier a weekly communication that the United States would not help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic pathways of the world's main power at stake, thrusts both inside the developing world and among the world's industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current fight is mostly about the conservation of individual economies rather than the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States on the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while poor people point out that two dozens of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to carry out the most important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the Costa Rican delegate, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of greenhouse gas reduction, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers responsible in their actions.
It is a clear game that the new economic hegemonia is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature.
Some countries, which are the most vulnerable effects of climate change, indicated that they would want to continue to enforce a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants, said that the best result of the interviews would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members has created a 24 page proposal for a deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the promotion from small island nations "induced a political stick for the entire political process" partially because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations raised a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the remaining questions in question before the heads of the government were dealt with.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environment Jairam Rameš and the Chinese Deputy Minister, have stepped out of the aircraft and conducted the Bell Centre halls to close the meeting door and new conferences so they could set out the claims that will be assessed next week.
The total volume of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved every day from and to the congress centre, to guitars playing activists inscend at nights ironiating the countries they thought they had sent them out, and there were proposals to hand-hand-hand paper rather than electronic mail - controlled by the challenge.
Intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the midst of 60 heads of the state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
There are heavy weights coming.
The British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour overreacted the feelings this Monday
5:13 on Monday morning, the hvizd cut the dark on the sign of departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and passes from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras and overcomes the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal set outside of lLndýn.
He hopes that, where appropriate, the new service will connect Britain to the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomeration of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
The abandoned fixed waters should be reduced in passenger transport and on commercial journeys and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate the carriages on roads.
Theoretically, three main political parties have been made available for this vision.
But dozens of liberal bilines, needed to build a new national rail network, inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disturbances, have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasible study, passed its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times said.
She provided him with a detailed map of the routes of another high-speed stage.
New London routes with West Midland have been designed within five meters in urban areas and quarters where it could be problematic to reach a life-provision.
In the open landscape it was scheduled to reach 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also assumes to establish three choices for a large high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option is to confiscate the shape of the letter Y, when one high-speed track should lead to Western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, going from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leedsu and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most effective choice has occurred," said the Railway Railway expert.
Once it's done, the time between London and Edinburg will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in presence.
The proposals should allow trains to drive 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already proposed to take trains of 400 m long to be able to transport 1100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the line of London - Birmingham.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to operate up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is expected that the existing station would be extended to capture a high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will notify whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before general elections.
Even if it puts wheels in motion, the network should be built by parts.
Trains should first be put into operation not on high-speed lines but already existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain time between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is deemed to be a decisive liaison point to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, the indicative point for the revolution on rail.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75000 on Tory's oranges
Alan Duncan, the holders of the front seat bench of Tory in the House of Parliament, paid thousands of pounds of taxpayers last year for the orangery that he built in his house in the constituent district.
The spokesperson of the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron, for complaining that the members lived "from allocations", increased their mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak of expanding in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
General authorities approved the entitlements in time, so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the control of Member expenses, and last night Mr Duncan said his demands, "means to be cleaner or easier."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two floor houses in the village of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
He added a winter garden to the house last year, which is marked as "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "a glass for fun and amusement".
Mr Duncan has not been asked to provide some explanations for an increased loan during the last check by the Committee on General Standards and the privilege in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The Committee told him last month that he violated the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupil's confidence to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his electoral district, which he bought in 1991, year before he became a member of the House.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1400 a month in the interest of mortgages until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1800 pounds per month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS's mortgage could not change at this time, which suggests that all this was intended to finance the loan of £75000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment decreased in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, which remained.
The last document of the general authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 a month this May.
Mr Duncan left his work as the shadow leader of the House in September after one secret rapporteur filmed it and said that the Members had to survive the "attribute" after the scandal with expenses.
"It's basically multiplied, you have to live on the tribute and treat you like with **t."
He said, "I spent the money for my garden and my claim and a little fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The messenger, a millionaire from the former career as a oil dealer, was first invited to explain his release in May when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it could be considered excessive.
One of the activists kicked out the pit in the form of a libra mark in Mr. Duncan's lawn for a protest after it revealed that he claimed £4,000 for a period of three years.
When he was questioned last night for an increase in mortgage, Mr Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved both by the financial authority and subsequently by Legg."
He added: "This is not a question of hiding and clipping or breaking rules or something.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to the rules, legitimate, and that's all.
That wouldn't be much cleaner or easier."
All of you should come and look carefully at the cabin on brighton coast with an advent calendar.
Coast cottages in Brighton have found a new sense of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group, which encourages the duck exploitation of the creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas knees as a topic of this elevation.
The event began on December 1st, when visitors allowed to look at the last cabin from 17:30 to 18:30 every day, and bishop bread and welded wine provided free of charge.
The selected rounds included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cabin represented the work of Janetty Tozer, local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant at TV marketing from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in chichester diecéze and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important to people in the post-Christian society.
"Why should we expect as a church that people will come into a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a awakening way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the cottage was just formed as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place, and we tried to try and present it spiritually."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday with a demand for a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, were demonstrated throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police resources and a hundred thousand according to the organizers were manifested in a cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aimed at adopting an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish President of the Climate Conference, stated that the growing global mobilisation, which is clearly evidenced by the present manifestation, contributed to the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen, would be too high.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, where a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break the ribbons and hammers.
Immediately, the orderly police intervened.
Overall, the police announced arrests of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were especially members of "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups which have already appeared in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "no different" and pointed out that about a hundred of them were in bondage and in the saddle "was still in the streets on Saturday night" even over the extreme winter.
After Parliament's departure, the parade went quietly towards Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the inside.
For speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting took place in candles for the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities and there was a large number of Asian participants, including several Chinese and Koreans, except Africans.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue caps, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning, on the call of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of ecological debt for the south, explaining Lida Nacpilová, the Philistine fighter from Jubileee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't tell each other anymore: it's time for the Beninian singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water flows dry, we can walk in them today, and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the fight for another world has approached environmental organisations.
The French Euro MP José B, one of the characters fighting for another world said that he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Chomorian area in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, there were about 50,000 people on the streets.
In Manile there were several hundred people, mostly students, in red clothes and scarfs that evoke the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, there were several hundred demonstrators in the streets, requiring a strong measure against climate change.
In France, "350" protests attended hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (jih), Lille (sever), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
There were several dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abchasia chose her president, Georgia judges it as "fraschus"
On Saturday, Abchasia chose her president, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent in Georgia, Tbilisi declares this step "fraška".
About 13,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Green War in August 2008 on control of South Osetia, which is another former Georgian territory, recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed in the 17th hour GMT.
According to the officials of the Abchaz Election Commission, 58% were attended a few hours before the closing of the election rooms.
The first preliminary results should be declared at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including the President-in-Office of Sergei Bagapš, have categorically rejected the idea of merger with Georgia, who condemned these elections.
These elections are beautiful.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakasvili "he regrets that Abcházie fell completely into the Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory with 216.000 inhabitants of only Nikaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the division from Georgia, after the conflict in 1992-1993, during which several thousand people died, Abchasia is trying to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the letter AFP Kvarčija Worldlan, the 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapsh.
She was one of those who came to the election room at the school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the banks of the Black Sea, which can proudly be a wonderful nature.
All over this small country with 216.000 inhabitants are distributed by huge billboards with Bagapšo next to Russian President Dmitri Medveděv and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the Russian officials who came to watch for a marvelous course of elections have enjoyed warm acceptance by the district mayor of Beslan Arsby.
"We, Abchaz, we are grateful," said in a small ceremony, having in mind the support of Moscow, and in particular its decision to acknowledge the independence of Abchasia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations Organization, said Alexej Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and he drank a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadhimba and two traders Zausem Ardzinba and Beslan Boutbou, criticized contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control the rail network of Abcházie for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is required to win in elections.
If none of the candidates fail to achieve this result, a decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: World manifestations, Copenhagen events
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday with a demand for a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, were demonstrated throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested around 700 people on the occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police resources and a hundred thousand according to the organizers have manifested an afternoon in a cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After Parliament's departure, the parade went quietly towards Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the inside.
For speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting took place in candles for the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after the departure of the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed all in black and armed bricks and hammers, began to break the window.
The orderly police immediately rounded them and hit them without waiting, while several manifestators hit the ground.
Overall, the police announced arrests of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were especially members of "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Later this afternoon, a police officer on the jaw was injured and four cars were burned near the squat near the incidents that resulted from police arrests of about 20 people.
We're focused on the extremist groups, warned spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while helicopters flew back into the air.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origins.
But there were a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue caps, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".

The French Euro MP José B, one of the characters fighting for another world said that he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam called on several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN Commissioner for the refugees of Mary Robinson to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Chomorian area in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, there were about 50,000 people on the streets.
In Manile, several hundred people were manifested in front of the City Hall of the capital of Philippines, mostly students in red clothes and scarves that evoke the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta there were several hundred demonstrators with the requirement of a strong action against climate change.
In France, "350" protests attended hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (jih), Lille (sever), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
There were several dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of the geography and history will be strengthened in the context of the reform of the general gymnasium, declared Chatel.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during the interview for the journal JD that the subjects of history and geography will be in the context of the reform of the general gymnasium "silnises", although their teaching will no longer be obligatory in the last year of the gymnasium focusing on exclusive sciences.
Now all students will have a second year four hours a week, and for all there will be the same program from general culture, confirmed Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it is necessary to end with hypocrisy", because he believes that S is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "the best students are basically in it."
The EC and L specialisation cannot be for such under-specializations, continues and stresses: "I have brought many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year the professional gymnasiums do not learn the geography and history".
Ifop’s survey, which published the Humanité’s journal on Saturday showed that seven Frenchmen of 10 (69%) disagree with the government’s project to cancel the compulsory teachings of history and geography in the senior year with specialisation of S, therefore many intellectuals and teachers criticized this cancellation, both the left and some right-wing Members.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not taken into account" to cancel philosophy in the program of the specialisation of the year of graduation.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform of teacher education, while 16 organisations (students and unions) called for the Tuesday mobilisation against this project, which according to them sacrificed the education of future gymnasium professors.
In the course of Master's Study 2 (M2), the Minister explained at the beginning of the year's receiving test focused on their field and at the end of the year the additional examination to verify their ability to teach.
He will attend professional internships during the second year of Master's Study, and first year before pupils will act as a professor-stayer.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before you receive the procedure, you will get more experience with students, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which is not yet in national education.
Reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At elite University of École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to persuade climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel announced in the congregation in the morning, a more president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole Normale supérieure on Ulm.
As one journalist AFP informed, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate opened the first of the conference "Ernest", which is some one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of what they would like to learn more, explained on the occasion of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar that received the name by the fish from the local pond that the students named this way.
Approximately 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and stated that the selection is based on their charisma.
About the warming of the climate, "We can talk hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It's part of our scientific work, emphasized with the hope that the listeners will recognize that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Video filmed on these lectures will be placed on the school website from December 15th.
The next seminar "Ernest" is planned for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delay: an angry prison overseer, planned measures
The prison overseers' departments announced on Friday's "general mobilisation" because they require them to be paid for premiums and overtime, for financial reasons, to be postponed to January.
Prisoners' FOs (2nd branches of overseers) have requested employees who will not have the service to attend demonstrations held on Tuesday morning before prison facilities, and to "lock them" and to point out "the wages of their wages".
CGT for the prison overseers (3. unions of this sector) is called on to "initiate meetings in individual prisons and start a major mobilisation" with the fact that it is "wise and unacceptable" to make "overtimes and surcharges for work at night, Sundays and holidays" processed in October, not paid in December.
The first branches of overseers, the Federal Union of prison overseers (Ufap/Unsa), "invites total mobilisation... to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The Directorate-General and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but ensure that the debt amounts will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent the prison overseers a communication in which it ensures that the payment will be made next month.
I know about the efforts of the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, he writes the Minister in his communication.
I ordered the Prison Directorate to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which was caused by a bad assessment of the number of overtimes, has never repeated in the future, added to Minister Alliot-Mari.
Therefore, December's wage will be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous premiums for the performance of the functions and achievement of the objectives, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those "is always a place in the budget".
It's just a scandal, an interregional union of FOs in Marseille has commenced itself and announced her decision to fight against the appeal of "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays if their surcharges for these days of October are not paid in December, as well as in overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when they give us increasingly more work and more tasks without giving us additional staff available, it is sad to allow you to pay the lowest position of employees, says CGT-incarnation overseers in Bordeaux.
According to the union, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case, little money is found by the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says she's giving "better presents" for Christmas than the ones she gets
The American President Barack Obama, who prepares for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confiscated "the goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that, as regards gifts, has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of a show that will be broadcast on Sunday night at the ABC station on how they're going to spend Christmas and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a little four-foot family mate gets his share.
Jesus also likes Boa, Michelle Obama said that the doggy also "superiorly" gets a gift, as it results from the episodes from the pre-disports of the show.
And Michelle Obama also replaced against her husband's statement on the quality of gifts that he received: "That's for sure not, I gave you great gifts last year," she barked the president.
Well, of course, that's true, he was forced to agree to the president, but immediately with humor he showed a finger on the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
On this one-day very relaxed show with a famous moderator who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obam's husbands also talked about their most popular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a 10-degree gearbox, but also a basketball, which was devoted to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, with which he was only very rarely encountered.
I remember when I saw my father who came to see us at Christmas, and as he gave me that basketball, the president told me.
For a long time after I realized that the ball actually gave me him.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize it all in my house, so I fixed all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fire, but I loved that little doll house, Michelle Obam remembered.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles because of the "ranging" caused by a larger operation that he had done in France, but the situation is according to his nearest "under control", while the RTL station said that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
66-year-old rocker was reoperated at night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors stated "the wounds resulting from the operation" the wrecked gospels he made in Paris on November 26, told his press department in Paris that these lesions required "repaired operation".
However, the press department of the singer has tried to calm the public and stated that the situation is "under control" and has announced that the new medical community will be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial sleep to prevent "bolests and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little more certainty, he adds RTL.
The press department, on the AFP question, did not confirm or comment.
The RTL also states that according to "some sources" there was no drone after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the international Parc Monceau clinic for a heated fence.
The operation, which was scheduled for several days in advance, was carried out by the neurochirurger Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well-known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles on Monday because of the infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye said on Thursday on the RTL radio that his friend was just going through a bad time, but he added that he's not worried about rocker because he's a big fighter.
He called me just before he left to Los Angeles, but I told him he was stupid because he spent 12 hours on the plane after this operation, there's no fun, Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night he calmed the situation of the singer producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well for antibiotics", and that the infection was "stop".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laetica, a singer's wife, and he didn't notice any special concerns.
The singer's medical problems are only multiplying since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "mal tumor of thin intestines" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his bachelorette.
But since then, every health problem has been very monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid November, his team must have demented the new hospitalization report again.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the world championship in 2009 in a large pool, won a title on Thursday at the European Championship 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul in discipline, which he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship on which the combinations are last permitted, only three world records fell, although much more expected.
One of them has crossed the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová at 200 m of the field race and two remaining male staff of Russia on 4x50 m of the field race.
A great grief for Bousquet, who made a world record of 50 m in a free way, which is already held in a large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal swim disciplines, 50m free way, won 28-year-old French with the end of 20.53 seconds in the final, where the premiere started ten swimmers instead of common eight.
Bousquet defeated Chorvato Duje Draganja (20,70) and Ruso Sergei Fesikov (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20.30), as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record is in my reach, I'll try for it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swims were wearing suits made of polyurethane, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
The combines helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of a combination this time neither the Germans Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record in reach of his hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record that holds up to 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew this time I wouldn't beat the world record, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: the Roma sarcophagus board belonging to Zol was released for USD 1.5 million
The board of Romani sarcophagus, which was no one other than the French writer Emila Zol, was released on Thursday for $1,5 million of US dollars, which is significantly more than estimated, said the artist with Sotheby's arts.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm high front plate, originating in the third century of our year, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "which presents four dionese scenes in a worked architectural decor, surrounded by satira and bakchanta is a rare work, similar pieces are very few in the world, perhaps four or five," said the AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, the Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian arts at Sotheby's.
The work was sold between hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it's the subject that was thrown about the most, told the AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was found a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared at the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated the bath with her in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before joining Marshal Petain.
She's been stuck there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered when searching for the museum database in Louvr that this album was part of the "Emila Zoly remains" opened since 1903, year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and "Rougon-Macquart".
A interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico, on Thursday, considered that the conditions for transport of the concealed President Honduras, Manuel Zelay, who refused to provide a safe exit guarantee.
Following a telephone interview that I had with President Zelaya last night, everything suggests that there is no way to accomplish this transport, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived on Wednesday to Salvador for President Zelaya, flew back, said the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Puppies government wanted to force President Zelay to "demis" and to ask for political asylum abroad, it would only give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the deceased president refused these requirements because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of the state.
The government of pupils "has suffered another failure when she wanted me to give up my function... they wanted me to give demissi", said Zelaya radio Globo on Thursday, in which it often expresses itself to a political crisis that lasts five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, he added a crooked president, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately, we cannot accept this because it does not contain an application for asylum, said the Minister of the Interior of the Puchist Government, Oscar Raul Matute to the Dutch radio HRN.
I won't ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for the Telesur station, who is headquarters in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll leave as President of the Dutch people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelay's departure have mobilized the center of the rebellious president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the purchasing government.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, added.
Zelaya, who was close to the socialist President of Venice Hugo Chávez, was conceived on 28 June, on the day he organized in preparation for his re-election of public consultations against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, Army and Congress.
From the exile in Costa Rica, the 21st September returned unexpectedly and found refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested, and he'll be responsible for the crime of "velezrady", of which he's accused, he claims the purchasing government.
The Puchist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize the presidential elections on 29 November to replace President Zelay.
In controversial elections, recognised by the United States, but condemned by Latin America countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, the Congress voted against the return of President Zelay to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, the US business balance runs to optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the American business balance indicate the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing data, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on "from half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on the numbers of the American business balance, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The United States Business Balance deficit dropped by 7.6% compared to September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
The analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
The growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, is a reflection of the growth of the economy of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the Economy.com research company.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment has increased against all expectations and the number of job tenderers reached the number 474.000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new candidates for employment "to the lowest of this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The revenue of the Treasury with a view to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the return to 30 years increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% of the day before that.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime whispered "Blues in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime broke out on Thursday the wife of political prisoners, gathered in Hawaii on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights and prevented further manifestations on which tens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Dam in White", wives or close political prisoners were banished directly on the street by the supporters of Raula Castra's regime on their way to the center of the capital, with the requirement for the release of political prisoners, informed the journalist.
"The street belongs to the revolutionarys!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" scanned with the lifted fists of the regime to dissidents.
Disidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to secure security.
A day before that, there was a similar manifestation against "Blue in White" against Hawaii, but there was no injury or arrest.
However, in the Hawaii Vedado district, about ten dissidents were detained by civilian police officers who were also going to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day, informed the AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, the police have imposed dissidents who have been banished by governmental supporters to civil vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions only lasts a few hours.
The Sacharov Prize Holders of the European Parliament for 2005, "The ladies in white" organized an unauthorised march for "resolute release of all, according to distant, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollanová, whose husband Héctor Maceda repents for 20 years of prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remains behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opposers as "foreigners" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A hot miracle, Cuban TV brought a report on the fourth manifestation of governmental supporters against the Revolution opponents.
Cuba and Communist Party are regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organisations of non-respect for human rights and freedom, including freedom of speech.
Crazy knife killed an 80-year-old man and hurt five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of the tip on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old man in a pharmacy or before, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
Hardly wounded old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police syndicate in the hospital for the injuries.
In this pharmacy or before it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband of about thirty years of age began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously wounded victims were taken to the same hospital in which the 80-year-old man died.
The second injured life is in danger, according to police resources, it seems that vital organs have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then ran to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more people, probably by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other person seriously.
How all this has happened is not quite clear, for everything has happened in the evening hours.
He was armed by two butcher knives, carried by the cross behind his back, said at the site the leader of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several survivors, including young people, tried to stop and disarm a madman, according to the testimony of the gathered AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a waiter from the nearby bar.
The crowd, including one city policeman, who broke his wrist, added it.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of heading 61, two city policemen, including their commander, tried to detain an armed man and were injured by fists, said the police source.
An incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Friends came here to tell me there's a wounded person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big abdominal wound, told AFP Frederic Allion, a 30-year-old pharmacy.
Five minutes later, the second, about thirty-year-old person, who also had a stab wound with a knife.
A man who had no ID arrested after the state police.
The D.A. in Nanterre handed over a matter to the Regional Police Investigation Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspected attacker was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for an interrogation.
The police source didn't exclude his location in the psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said there was a need for six police officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy where he was transported.
He was "people out of himself" as "all madmen of this type, whose strength is increasing in action tenfold."
U.S.: Polansky's lawyer again asks for the termination of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Romana Polanski reproduced on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, which is currently located in his Swiss residence due to the moral affiliation that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film director "Pianist" criticized before three judges of the second term appeal court in California, the serious mistakes occurred during the trial at the time of events in 1977.
I demand to stop the prosecution now and now, lawyer Hummel said, and he added that from the conduct of the judge who had decided on the case, Laurence Rittenband "made to the back."
According to him, he had a judge (who had already died among them) before the judgment allegedly acted with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – which is a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information about this conversation appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the State's representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will require the court's trial to submit evidence of his claim.
The applicant repeated what was already said in the first state, because there will be no serious examination of the application for a halting criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski stands in court.
The 76-year-old director fled from the United States in 1978 before the court sentenced in the case of "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a minor girl at the age of 13.
Since then, he has never again entered the United States territory.
Attorney's deputy in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski's supposed to be there to attend the court trial.
We want to say to Roman Polaski in this case not only, but to another defendant that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
It's the opinion that the director "requires kindness for court, and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that there are other alternatives to escape.
Lawyer Hummel wasn't himself who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The vic's attorney, Samantha Geimera, also asked for the end of a criminal prosecution.
She reminded that her client can no longer handle this everlasting harassment every time Polanski emerges and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was just."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on a U.S. command
After more than two months behind bars, he was released into a home prison in his chapel in Gstaad, where he was waiting for any outpost.
Wall Street ends out of direction, stops him up a dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday with no direction, the market is thrown between indicators that are better than expected in the US and a rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, Dow Jones Industrial Average progressed from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It stays in a narrow margin, the volume of trade has decreased very much, and I think that's how it stays until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve the mood on the market as regards the stability of economic recovery," summarised Charles Schwab's analyst.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November and the second month after each other and much more than expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the trust of American consumers also returned and in December increased to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indicators were made by a new increase in the dollar price towards the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, "to push down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are losing the soil under their feet.
The securities market has fallen.
State Treasury over 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a view to 30 years increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% by day earlier.
Miss World election again in South Africa.
After a monthly journey across the South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are going to cross the target base to reach their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television viewers.
This great feast of beauty has been held in the area of Johannesburg for the second year, and for the time being five candidates have reached the semifinal process.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acostaová from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top model during their African stay.
It was a true faith of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durbana or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!
The competition held in South Africa will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 hours (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream a more beautiful country I'd wear a crown in.
It was an fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could have experienced it twice, confided with Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the Republic of South Africa was held in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and new discovery of the country and its "deathlands".
After a month of performances, trials, press meetings, and safari now Miss is focused on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes that she will go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, chosen in 2000, which also participated in the elections of Aishwarye Rai, winners from 1994, which became both Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is a dream of every woman, but it's not just a look.
We're an emissary of our countries, and I want to go home with a crown, say Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The performance will be presented by Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of Beauty of the South Africa Republic Michelle McLean and Chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that Julia Morley, the President of the Miss World Challenge, can welcome the world with warmness that is difficult to deal with.
The candidates, like last year, attended the safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shattered their hands.
It's unusual for the president, Miss Sierry Leone.
The most beautiful memory will undoubtedly remain the drawback in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could've met people I didn't even dream about.
I'm sure I'm going back to the 2010 World Cup, saying with the enthusiastic Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports on Hallyday's condition are very positive.
The news of Johnny Hallydaye is "very positive" as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport inLos Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father who has been hospitalized for several days.
News is very positive.
It's very strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday declared on the airplane exit, which flew from Paris shortly after 13 hours of local time (the 21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who acted quietly, said that "the fastest way" would come to the Los Angeles Hospital Cedars-Sinaï, which was admitted to Johny Hallyday on Monday because of the post-operative infection caused by an inflammmatory inter vertebrate fences that he undergoed on 26 November in Paris.
According to the press release, the night in Los Angeles was singing because of the comfort of "induced into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already put into an artificial sleep. The hospitalization was due to infection after the operation of the heated interbrating fences performed on 26 November in Paris.
Because of the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer must have been reoperated at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the photographer's information, his wife Laetiia attended a school show of French lyce in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade on Friday morning.
Preliminary departments of orthopedic surgery and traumatology hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, reported that he was flying to the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer hardly accusedDr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurochirurger who operated on Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles declared they were invaded, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday's gone to Los Angeles too quickly, with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I spoke with a doctor personally, and he assured me that this journey was not a problem, which was very surprising, since I had already twice suffered from the winner of the inter-vertebrates, he added.
A few moments earlier at the radio station, the RTL said that the singer probably flew after a Parisian operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in art circles.
He operated Mary Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he worked at at that time.
In 2007 he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the haematoma resulting from bleeding into the brain.
Of course, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect medical care, for tax evasions and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber Olivier Metzner referred him to as "human without scrupules", which is "regularly" called in before the medical chamber, and which can not be "recommended far".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed his case through his lawyer David Koubbi on Friday.
He announced that the procedure had a "all good course" and the post-operative examination was "normal."
Operation was not a haemorrhagic character, and therefore it was not necessary to introduce the drain", he added.
The health problems of the singer have grown since this summer, and in any case, it seems that another tour remains with a question.
It is obvious that the deadline for renewal of the planned tour on 8 January (in Amiens, noted Red.) appears to be too close, declared Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and invites the side of Nouveau Centre to continue to use their shortcut.
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt of President of the Nouveau Centre, Herého Morina to accommodate the shortcuts of the former Giscard Party, with that it must not be used in any media under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to accommodate a shortcut of UDF with the fact that François Bayrou did not deserve to bear her inheritance after he gave his left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is the partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of Nouveau Centre Movement (NC).
This step gained the support from Ms Hervé de Charetta (ex-UMP now for NC), which attributes the ownership of the UDF brand, since it was the first to register in 2004 in the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprieté industrielle).
But on Friday night, the UDF Association Committee of controlled friends of Françoise Bayroua, who are not going to be deprived of their own, stepped out of their silence and made a formal request to the Minister and Members to stop using a shortcut and to hand over the ownership of a trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised an alarming statement of suggesting your political movement + once again take over+ a shortcut of UDF, writes the Association in your letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoD or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance Cenriste.
At the same time you considered appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, also notes the letters signatories.
As you are known, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF committee that asks the NC movement, so to remove all the mentions of UDF's name from all promotional materials including (such) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over ownership of a trade mark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do that, we will turn to courts to be respected by the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF members, alert the signatories.
In their letter states that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and reminds that Mr Morin and his friends "election" in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, as others in 2002 to set up a UMP.
Therefore, the Nouveau Centre has no right to use the UDF shortcut (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for joining the MoD for three years and for the creation of a committee responsible for defending the "moral and material interests" of the association established by Valérym Giscardem d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered a trademark", he was not a member of UDF three years", but a UMP.
In a scandal and in a fraudulent way, he used the non-existent acrylic registration to do so on his own account.
This inappropriateness begins to transform into a crime, declares themselves, and then with irony expresses themselves to the NC strategy: "We think that in politics and in normal life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to step out of anonymity by accepting a name that we have no right to".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of the condition of weakness.
On Friday, the court in Nanterre decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and make a judgment whether he used the status of weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which blames her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
Photograph (62 years), known by the famous photographs will be judged by 15th and 16th April 2010 for the abuse of the state of weakness, which is a crime for which the penalty is imposed at a maximum of 3 years and a penalty of EUR 375 000.
This Decision confirms that a bail process that can be referred to as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mothers and daughters face each other and fight for the management of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliany Bettencourt, which should conduct a college of three doctors.
The grandfather and the head shareholder of L'Oréal have always refused to undertake such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State Attorney in Nanterre during the investigation.
Physicians who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time comment on whether Liliana Bettencourt could be found in the state of weakness and in which period.
I think he'll give it up.
I'll talk to her about it. He said after the hearing, attorney Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
With regard to lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Menzer, he welcomed the court decision.
It's an excellent report(...). Expertize will show that this old lady who needs protection has been manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It's two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter started a criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, the photographer and all-wise scientists who blamed her mother's weakness for years to gain a billion euro gift in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master's paintings.
As a result, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by a photographer he considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to judge the legality of the lawsuit lodged by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the fifth law of the lawyers had changed in the family hour of truth.
Liliany Bettencourt has submitted three letters by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, and in which she expressed her disbelief to her husband Françoisy Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt adds, "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for 15 years once twice a day.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State Prosecutor in Nanterre again found that the proceedings of the complainant are not justified, moreover, that the guardian judge rejected her application for the opening of the proceedings for legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the court, is not under protection or in care.
No one else will act for it," confirmed the representative of the D.A., Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would express herself at the time of commencement.
Manager revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes to the management of the great French companies, our fight for economic intelligence was useless...
For more than ten years, it reminds the behaviour of the management of large companies against employees of company access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is important that the collaborators identify themselves with "values" targeted from the mountain, as it was before the consumer had to force products that came from the ideas of the heads of factory techniques.
By making the customer the centre of business companies, the marketing revolution of the market's market acquisition strategy was compared in the right direction...and when authoritarian efforts to force products, different from customer preferences, they regularly return!
Passive employee approach can lead to fatal demoralisation.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which mainly interferes with managerial cadders.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more important, economic intelligence.
And really, the EI "required from all stakeholders... active approach and ability to predict" and requires from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the revenue of the authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to put workers in the centre of business interest as well as the client.
Relative usefulness of internal public opinion surveys.
Internal public opinion surveys - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that the structure will return first to what she's always done in the face of a new situation.
Furthermore, as an authorityist as one of the pathologies of power, the severity of its failures is increased proportionately.
Finally, because most of the managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of high school engineers, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of thoughtful comfort, they develop an old behavioral theory, now re-resurrected "neurovědes" from the US and abundantly widespread without greater knowledge of scientific institutes and media.
With the possibility to move the "pakami" (sic) involvement of managers, he has shown the recent survey of Ipsos on the Figaro.fr website, which simply establishes the controllers in their position of mechanical management, inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises assumes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating the basic observation into all intentions and practices of management : For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
This concept of motivation of employees currently deals only with research on the motivation of functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined dox, which will allow them to, through an image that tells them about the company, to evaluate what it offers to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and introduce their management of human resources "on the right way".
This creates a live land for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
By demonstration from Oslo, "A righteous war" Obama earned praise by the right hand.
The American Rights on Friday welcomed the speech that Barack Obama presented the day before that in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize Holder for 2009 defended the concept of "righteous war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who were laughing at the award of the Prize to Obama on October 9, this time the President's speech, including Sarah Palin, former vice president candidates in the 2008 elections.
I liked what Palin said, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, for the United States of today's journal, and she added that she herself expressed itself to this topic of "sometimes necessary" war in her memories that are currently coming out.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans would want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be kept there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor,George W. Bushovi, in Thursday, justified the broadcast of forces and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, recognized that the president did a great job in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated by the former President of the House of Representatives, who, above all, appreciated the president's mention of the "existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech entirely historical, said Gingrich during the interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
A former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was thrilled to see "the left president" reminding the members of the Nobel Prize Committee," that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace if the use of the forces had not existed."
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of George W. Bush speeches, now editor Washington Post, Obama presented "a great American speech."
Not only did he introduce himself as a "worldly Citizen" as always, but "speaking as an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they did not do too much to keep it," he evaluated Gerson.
Among the few unsatisfactory right-wings include the bush era, the former Ambassador at the United Nations John Bolton, who referred to the expression "single, naked, and without inspiration", as said on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the President, such as the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich, is terrified when looking at Barack Obama, justifying the use of forces.
"When we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-leading press is a commendable opinion against the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the price of the Obam peace premature, he considered his output as a "permanent" even for a speaker known by his talent.
The manifestation from Osla should serve as a guide to an international decision to deal with conflicts, in combating poverty and anxiety," says the California Log.
Obama said, "He said what he needed," he evaluated the New York Times, and said, "a simple and instructive."
Road carriers: three marathons to the agreement to save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating maratons, the unions of road carriers and TLF have come, the only employer organisation that remained until the end, on Friday night to the agreement that ended the call for strike and the threat that owed over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, on Friday's signing of the agreement, expressed "happiness" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night, the negotiators discussed on Friday morning soon broke up with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as quickly as possible by the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned.
But there was a need for more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 hours to all agree and at 18 hours to sign the agreement.
This conflict " would hurt businesses very much" and "an danger of disturbing holidays at the end of the year" said Bussereau.
The text contains an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (national transport).
The hour wage for the lowest salaries increases from EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort, explaining Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we will give our members an order to avoid blockages, no blockages of supply centres.
But there may be a few more opposers who are not satisfied, "added.
Philippe Grillot, President TLF, welcomed the "good deal", although it was hard to admit high salaries due to the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month at the lowest wages and by EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is an agreement of sound sense and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT) this is a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focusing on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective contract.
Bussereau recalled "reduction of EUR 100 million on corporate wage taxes" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 Budget Law, which voted on the Thursday night of the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote for "suitable" vote.
The signature allows that this agreement will first apply to undertakings that are members of this organisation, later on to the entire department, in the event of the extension of the Ministry of Labour.
Bussereau will take place as soon as possible.
Only disagreement of employers' organisations can slow the entire process.
The FNTR is talking about "sick trade" because 100 million euros "the sector has been offered in the context of compensation for part of carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not due to mutual analysis, but to not annoy the edibles of turkeys in the near Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre's organization, the agreement will be threatened to bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises from the field in the next 12 months.
Staff trains RER A: discontinuation of transport on the weekend, unions unsatisfactory with the draft RATP transport company.
The interruption of transport on the RER A subsidiary line, which is the largest line of public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as the fifth negotiations between the RATP and the management of the second day of the strike did not lead to any specific results in the issue of the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will only ride between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (La Défence and Nation) will ride every second train, outside this section only one train from four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to move to another train.
Trade houses Gallerys Lafayette, which are expected every day by over 200 000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP has tried to secure connection with large business homes".
Line RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP managed section leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday there was a train in operation from two, and practically no set was driving at the time out of the top, as planned.
As in Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged themselves differently, and there was no confusion in the platforms.
So early morning there was much less people in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among others because students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was up about "hour and half soon to make sure he would arrive in time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not overflowed, announced by the SNCF State Railway, for a greater number of constituents and order guards were foreseen.
The RER trains and operated SNCF in direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare Station with a subway connection.
The next General Assembly of strikes will take place on Saturday and Sundays, on which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the leadership that the unions have assessed as weak.
Management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A subsidiary trains on all pages, working time adjustment, career progress, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Jih Division).
The RATP even for the time being put forward proposals regarding the premium, which made CGT worse, with the management of "the problem was not able to solve, while it was possible for travel carriers and SNCF".
The new meeting, scheduled for Monday, "recognize the terms of profession performance", specified the RATP transport firms.
Which was the reason the experts think that the business is making fun of the weekend travelers.
About 150 drivers took the company committee in his Paris mansion in the morning.
The management, which has not yet rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of calming.
There is a danger that the conflict will spread on Tuesday to RER B, after Unsa and the Independent announce a stack.
The branches request a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which EUR 30 of the variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Indépendents (Independent) and make it harder to deteriorate working conditions on this line, which daily transports millions of passengers.
Drivers of the RER subsidiary trains earn at a more advanced time of careers 2200 to 2700 EUR of gross wages and EUR 600 to 650 premiums for irregular working hours and for Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision brings heavy consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main prokuracy party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the government’s task that seeks to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The DTP party has been dissolved because it has become "the nest of activities that threaten the independence of the state and its indefinitely unity," said the President of the Supreme Court, Hasim Kilic, after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously 11 judges, when most seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said and added that 37 side tracks, including her President Ahmet Türk and Ms Aysely Tugluková, have been prohibited to participate in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity that Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluková used and confiscation of assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (from 500).
The Head of the Party has noted before the verdict that the Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is the continuation of the process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the cassing court Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accused DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Parties working in Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political villain of the PKK rebels.
The Party ensures that it has no "basic connection" with PKK, but refuses to deny it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the court comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit the support of the Kurds to the PKK and thus terminate the conflict.
DTP has confirmed that the resolution of the party could lead to a renewal of the tension on the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against conditions have been detained by the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators gathered before the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-eastern region, mostly Kurds.
The police used tear grenades and water cannons, demonstrators threw Molotov's cocktails or shot stones from the dusts.
In Istanbul, she also demonstrated about a hundred people.
Following the verdict, Mr. Türk said that justice's decision will only "intensify desperation."
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurds, notably red.) by banning the party, declared in the press.
The government, formed by the party from the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're from the principle against the interference of the parties.
There's nothing to do with it. The Minister for Energy declared Taner Yildiz.
This decision is an absolute shot of the democratic proposals that the government has launched, commented on the politologist Ahmet Insel.
Obviously, we're looking forward to the PKK reaction, he added.
On Thursday, PKK applied to one of the most murderous attacks in the north of Turkey, who killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
It's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, he says the Head of the Winter Department of Technical Services of the FES.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could be the first time by the meteorologists this weekend.
It is prepared over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
The FES shall, at the same time, follow the exact plan.
As soon as the snow falls in Frankfurt in full and temperatures below zero, they go to 20 so-called sections and large-scale squads, explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and passageways such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, urban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with decreasing as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
In case of need, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to suck in a moisture salt that is better held, about 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "to be free roads when it starts to get to work."
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, he says the winter department manager of technical services, "because no one's willing to make a place to scatter."
Only when it does not snow so much, it is a number of incoming and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is sideways and sideways.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At 5:00 a.m., FES pedestrians are going to clean up dangerous places and transitions.
FES can't usually take care of all cyclists.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service, which is followed by bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the ice cream is made fast on them, the syrups are coming out immediately as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Bike of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: Animals long two meters and 1,50 meters high were running in two strong rear limbs, had a long skull with sharp, folded teeth, short front limbs with sorrowed claws and long tail.
If this kind had lived a few million years later, there would be nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth edition of Science magazine says that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical signs.
An animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then found in a equatorial dry area of Pangea's supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about relative relations, enlargement and significance of early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt started and another paleontologist with kicks in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, it's not seen for trias, informs a member of the Randall Irmis from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected remains from a total of five individuals.
Find confirms the theory of the early history of the dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual finding: "The phosphorus of the dinosaurs of the trias are very rare, most of all are only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially the sensational finding is not, but confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, such as Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of the pradinosaurs is mostly disputed.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards split into three most important development lines: the carnites of the teropodi, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds, the "long-haired" of the four-numbered sauropodi and their relatives, and Ornithischia’s biscuits (ptakopans), including the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
In the Tawa hallae skull, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags that even the offspring of the birds have.
Thanks to air bags, breathing of birds is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were obviously partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive terrain with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of huge sauropods had air bags and light bones later, he created this useful innovation already probably common ancestors of both groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Since known most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists showed that lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, three development lines were split early and expanded from South America to all continents that were the supercontinent of Pangea.
She would also talk about the fact that the team and Tawa hallae found the remains of two others, not especially closely related teropods.
These three cannot come from one common, immigrated ancestor, argue scientists.
We believe that there were at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also differences.
One more older species, Silesaurus, who belonged to a group of the hardest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says bonnen paleontologist Martin Sander.
His presumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America there were very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, while the other continents were rarely found when.
How the dinosaurs proved to have developed from relatively rare sidelines of the plague family to rulers on earth in the days of the earth’s medieval age, remains a puzzle.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other plagues, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
At the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread to the whole world and developed many new species while relatives died and the trias and jury's interface.
The past of success did not last forever
There are two hypothesis, how to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but they didn't.
Or dinosaurs got better adapted, so they could push out the competition.
The story of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the impact of the meteorite of another group of animals, which developed in trias and lived in the shadow since then: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long, and the signatories are international.
On the list are professors of University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
The docents from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paula, Berlin or Brema have joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of the French University of Goeth has taken care of global commencement.
278 professors and teachers at Goeth University, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America have solidarized with protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written by German and English "do not approve" by a presidency stimulated by police intervention.
Because the walls and arts were darkened, the University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by striking students and lecturers last week.
Five students were injured.
The damages, judges the signatories, do not justify "the violent dissolving of self-organized teachings of students and teaching the police commander".
The clearing represents an unacceptable intervention in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unlawfulness and criminalization of the protest" and reflects attention from the content.
The presidium has avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers are calling for a halt of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
Repealed Protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German union are also solidarized by students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
So far, the Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defends the procedure of the universal president and the police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destroying and occupying are absolutely unacceptable resources, said on Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Actual Hour) in Wiesbaden's House.
We have an understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, told the MEP of the Earth's House behind the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition fractions of the SPD, the Greens and the Links.
The CDU takes painted walls for the excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of addressing the arguments and requirements of students, there was a clearing.
Linke has made a proposal that calls on the Minister of Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
Long years have paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Greenograd, one of the ten counties of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret arms research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres away from the Moscow Centre, as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Greengrade representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt scientific centre of Riedberg - with universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits were made and signed on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Around for close cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow multistar Jurij Rosljak and the prefect from Zelenograd Anatolij Smirnov, under Frankfurt, signed the lead referent to the planning of Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will be organized by the Environmental Research for the seminar in Greengrad.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The companies of FIZ will be allowed to accommodate the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Greenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moskev Institute of Electronic Technologies, the large concerts of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The period was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialistic planned city" for armed research.
Greengrad (the literal translation of "Green Town") has obtained its name according to the wooden hills in which the research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The Dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be sufficiently prepared.
It is simply "new heart of Europe" for project supporters.
S21 is more than the launch of the station, more than a monstrous construction that throws the capital of Bádenska-Württemberg for one decade into desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the '80s.
The head stations with railways ended in the city center were then considered to be a transport and technical fossil of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of modern rail transport, because it needed enormously a lot of time to convert the locomotive from the back.
Drive, stop, go on, that's how it should work.
That's why the main station is disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the passing station, which lies approximately halfway the Trans-European Railway Masters between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that slogan about the hearts of Europe.
It really starts with S21, although visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the facts.
Very ambitious designers have learned that in the Hebrew and Bavorian large town the launch of the construction is almost unfinancable.
Since there are modern quadril trains with motor and control vehicles on both ends, the head station has no problems with driving and driving.
Yet: Stuttgart 21 begins including a new ICE line to Ulma.
Earth and municipal politicians sold it.
Railways cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic carry a taxpayer and not a state-owned company.
Urbanly, the project can be excused in some other way.
There will be a new urban space, which - if we trust the computer images of designers - will contain many greens.
S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
Train stations and track construction are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - attributed a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights at that time.
However, modern transport policy must go first to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally environmentally environmentally than cars on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of a sharp rise.
More importantly, S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
The good six billion euros were to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, finances will be missing at the next node points and narrow places in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the list of transport departments.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 km long routes by the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been set at a slow pace.
There's a need to push.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route of the Rhine Valley will become the throat of the bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine the judgment on the airport
The Government of the Landscape has opened in Wiesbaden House if it will go against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) on the prohibition of night flights and will allow it to be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has entrusted experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of the VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today in writing justified that the State would have to adjust the night ban on flights in the case of construction of the planned Northwest ranvei of the French airport.
Permission of 17 years between 23rd and 5 p.m., as assumed by the earthly government, does not correspond to the law imposed on the protection of the population from night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if he will require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this deferral and arrived at the government's representative to refrain from revising the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD fraction Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called CDU and FDP to return to promises about the ban on the night flights she gave before the election. Otherwise it is possible to evaluate as "the violation of the word".
It's bloody hard, if you can keep your word, the boss of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir said, "We hold the word."
Minister Posch has refused Schäfer-Gümbel's quest, the government of the Earth is trying to get to their nightlights through "crueling rights and tricks".
The exact legal control needs his time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of a quick first impression.
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His fractions on the ban on night flights were never the same as the opposition.
The US banks shall pay assistance
American, crises trembled by large banks are disposed of state pilgrimages.
Bank of America paid off at once on Wednesday aid from Tarp bank rescue fund of $45 billion (about €30 billion).
According to the report, the CNBC also plans to repay state aid, Citigroup.
In this way, the Constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions on which money was accepted - limiting the payment of bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
The Bank of America has acquired $19 billion of net money in investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
The rest of the amount was taken from its treasure, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade.
The head of Kenneth Lewis bank specifically thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: The money injection helped us overcome the difficult time.
The pension institution damaged the peak of the financial crisis by taking Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its commitments to the State by obtaining money on the capital market.
The CNBC informed with reference to resources that this American bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
Speaker Citigroup didn't want to express it.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid their help.
Quick option
It was only quicker than expected.
The station introduced the successor two weeks after the Management Board of ZDF emptied the head of editor Nikolaus Brender from the office.
Last night, the gremium wanted to make a deal with that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital city of Berlin, was named favority.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially to prevent the process.
However, Roli could also play that they did not want to harm the authorising officer of ZDF Markuse Schächter, if he had not passed that proposal at the Management Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the gremium.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he failed at the Management Board of Schächter with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him. Brender's loss of mandate was bitterly defeated, although it was expected.
The EU majority in the Governing Board has signaled several weeks before the elections that he does not want to confirm Brender in the Office.
Resistance to the chief editor has organized the Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further persistence in the office of the high-weighted editor's argument that the ZDF intelligence broadcasting quotas for Brender decreased.
Until shortly before the election, the protests in which the political influence on ZDF was strictly criticized.
Last time, even 35 state-owned lawyers were involved in the debate, who considered Koch's procedure to be contradictory.
It wasn't useless.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teachers and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 he crossed Frey to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; by 1998 the head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 the Head of Foreign Policy of the ZDF; since then head of the ZDF main study.
After Brender, which was elected on Wednesday by the median periodicals of the Magazine of the Year, announced to the Greens that they were prosecuting constitutional action.
Koch's anti-Candidate in the Administrative Board, the Rine-Falth Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Federal Countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that the personal proposals of the authorising officer cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the Overseas Boards of ZDF.
Brender's foretold successor Peter Frey was in charge of a smart chess move, immediately after Brender's sedation, he criticized the gremium for that.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him to the head of editor without losing his face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the Administrative Board without being suspected that the party would be pushed into office.
In the side arithmetics, Frey is still referring to the left liberals.
The study is getting rid of harampaids.
Partial success for students: After a year of strolling, they finally arrived in the Federal Countries of Culture Ministers: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, the two parties agreed that the will to improve the study conditions for bachelor and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: each study module should, in principle, be terminated with one test.
In addition, the workload of students should be rechecked and the "real and defence rate" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal Countries undertake to create more flexible joint structures for bachelor and master studies.
Earth's deviations should stop existing.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in the worm, the Ministers of Culture and University Rectators had winged words about a better study.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board concluded that the number of tests in part of the drastically reduced: "Every module will usually be completed only once the test", writes in the 30-party report, which is partly to regulate the approval of study fields.
"Lastly lower test burden," said the chairman of the Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Board, "the wrong development should be stopped, which significantly limited the entitlement of the study."
This is meant to be a "a decision-making criterion" in the future in the implementation.
Modules and content shall "recheck hard" so that "sustainably not restrict students in the choice
seminars."
Students should have a "space to enable and support their own initiative".
The rules are to apply in approving new study fields, after review, but also for existing study fields.
It is necessary to "reakreditate" every five years, which means that it will take until 2015 before all study fields are rechecked.
Ten accreditation agencies, which are subject to the accreditation councils established by the Federal Countries, are responsible throughout Germany.
Cultural ministers called in October "prudently" the Federal Countries to act on agencies in such a way that the filling of the curriculum was not too big and the test regime was not strict.
In individual countries, universities and universities have already agreed with the Land Ministers on appropriate measures.
As so far, the only country has promised Porýní-Falcko additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
High schools should, in particular, play consultative programmes and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
That's what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wishes to submit a new university law to Parliament.
According to it, only one test should be needed for the completion of the study module.
Study formation should be even more flexible, to ensure the recognition of tests from other universities and to facilitate the access of the master.
By the end of next year, all study fields in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition were reconciled on Thursday on study conditions in the country.
Among the praises, the criticism of the resolution has also fallen.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Group Juso called for the development of education policy not to be played in the future "for closed doors" of ministers and higher-school rektores.
Most lately after the strike, students should "think at least a word" as well as a person concerned.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need students' experience", said on Thursday a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom HRK advised about the joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: they demand legal entitlement that would allow every graduate with a bachelor title to access the construction magister study.
Secondly, the Federal Countries must ensure that for today's generation of bachelor students there are plenty of seats available tomorrow in the master's study fields with the best possible study conditions, said a member of the Board of Directors of GEW Andreas Keller.
The Federal Countries must employ far more lecturers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves to free access to master programs.
More than the footnote to Müller's Hert
Getting to Germany and outside is nice, almost no control..." is the initial line of one poet poet Werner Söllner, who in this erected language bit has been subjected to the experience of travelling one dissident who gained freedom, but also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banata, first worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one child’s book publisher, then moved to Frankfurt over Mohan.
Söllner was awarded by various literary prices, 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary French University of Goethe, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesenian Forum of Literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of a considerable non-literal start last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Obviously, Söllner has left a statement in which a fellow writer of Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Tok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuthe Frauendorfer, a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language price in 1989.
The attempts to recruit began inappropriately, first in 1971.
I did, continued Söllner, "who did not defend enough attempts to intimidate Securitate."
Poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost with the award of the Nobel Prize of Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of dictatorial government is a literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania, shaken by a case that indicates the deepness and disgrace of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the status of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
In Securitate's files, secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession, Michael Markel, and gave a positive influence on himself a secret agent Walter.
"He dragged me" at all the point for him, says Markel.
It's a moral duty to make this note.
The statement of Söllner was not expected in this form and before this public, but it is not a surprisingly surprising confession of the former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller already wrote in July when she reads her own file, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Spice Securitate.
Subjects, can be assumed, they will speculate, and in some cases I think even know which name is hidden behind covers called Sorin, Voica, and also Walter.
In other words than in domestic, in the meantime, a very certain view of Stazi's components, manipulation with the remains of Securitate control is still very difusion.
Over the past years, the systematic insight has been painted and restricted.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the processing of Securitate (CNSAS) components, was founded only in 1999, the release of the act has been rather prolonged since.
Only since 2005, there is a law that manages the management of the components.
That the former Securitate members still have a great influence in Romania, following the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller's one interview, in which one of Securitate's former heads from Temesvár commented on the holder's appreciation rejected.
He said my psychosis, after all, she was only questioned once.
The power of power has expressed itself completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, Söllner, as in connection with a silent guilt, deals with inevitable questions.
Why now? To whom did it hurt? The special reaction of listeners to Söllner's confession allows you to expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more of a desire for knowledge than after the acknowledgement of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a footnote.
Saturated deposit of Champions League
It looked like a purely dressed salesman from a cute Christmas party on which he was handing out sports goods candy when he entered a four-hour after midnight into a called mercedes of class C, a new coach of VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange colored bag of sponsor.
A man with a marvelous bale made him drive another city.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and drunk luck was also a 55-year-old man.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow it's going to be continued at work.
Or it's just starting.
The words only three days engaged in Switzerland: "We have achieved eight-finals," namely in the Champions League, thanks to the winner:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be glimpse of success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the assembly."
"A little more important task" stands in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in the ordinary league day in May.
And to prevent the obvious weaknesses after three fast goals of Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11.).
Losing
The Osmifinals Champions League (wages 16./17. + 23./24 February/ revenge 9.10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on December 18th in Nyon.
The joy of the treacherous successor will therefore remain preserved.
Not only with a suspected healer who delivered insecure to the Scottgart professionals during a short period of self-confidence, willingness to deploy and joy of the game.
I went to the players, and I told them to focus on their strengths, and I asked them to be more courageous, explained by Gross soul healer so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not show any more effectiveness for Babbel's therapist.
He smothered some magic, admitted Babbel's admirer Jens Lehmann, "When a new impulse comes in football, things happen sometimes that you don't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's injuries caused by his dynamics, became the best player on the field, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" prominent "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "It is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Clearly it was missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns Sports Chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, even players and managers don't want to overestimate the victory against the weakened spare and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after the defeat of 0:4 in Leverkusen, he thinks Khedira.
And the sports president, Horst Heldt, reminded that, although it reached one goal in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt had not celebrated his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events that have recently lived in the form of a television interview with Jens Lehmann goalkeeper just before the beginning of the game.
There are decisions that others are active and not Jens, he departed Heldt on the hard Lehmann criticism.
He was leading the board of weak leadership and decided to change coach after the pressure of adolescent fans.
Even the fact that his free day after the fight was cancelled, Lehmann referred to as a sign of missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "forms pure egoism," said Heldt, and announced the consequency for goaltenders.
I don't think both 40s will be happy about life anymore.
Anyway, they're for one thing with the others, that without the work of a set-up coach team, it wouldn't be possible in a player's strong and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success," they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with an igelite bag agrees.
Fighting the World Cup in Heavy Weight
A passionate duel in Bern: The caller Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the Master of the World Vitalij Click.
However, after 12 hard wheels, Ukraine defended his title in the heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The judges were unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kličko remains the world champion in boxing heavy vase.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated him on Saturday at Bern American Kevin Johnson unanimously at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
It is the third successful defense after his return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukraine was the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen about what everyone expected.
Klick improved his balance on 39 wins in 41 professional fights, he was twice defeated because of the injury.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th fight.
About 17,000 viewers in the Berlin Arena were driving a 2,02 meters high Kličko fight primarily with his left.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Kličkova era before duel, but he pulled in front of the strikes of the master of the world, so Kličko couldn't plant a decisive punch of his dangerous right hand.
Totally, passive Johnson made enough of a challenger and was just trying to get into other wheels.
Although the key was provoking words and gestures, his strikes, but the masters of the world only hit a few times.
Still, it's just the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought the Klick full of 12 rounds.
The challenger took care of the insurgency in the Swiss capital.
He insulted the Klick as a "resilient zombie" that "nothing can do well."
During the weighing Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled Johnson's sunglasses out of his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after the Click Back
After the fourth fight, after his return on October 11, 2008, the key remained un defeated.
After almost a four-year break then he defeated Samuel Peter's Nigerian Berlin and took back his WBC band, who had to surrender without a fight before it.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez's title in the defense of Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this fight, I only got one punch, and physically I was in good shape, justifying Klick's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA band wears the British David Haye, after he settled from the throne of 2.13 meters of Nikolai Vulajev.
Haye replied in the summer a fight against the Klichk who was scheduled for September.
He's supposedly planning his promotional company to fight Klichk in the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
The head attack from the opposition: Chief of the Fractions of the Greens Jürgen Trittin has referred to the wrong information about the Kundúz Minister of Defense of Guttenberg as a liar.
SPD and Linke (Levice) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlín - According to the latest knowledge of the attack on Kundúz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed an conscious deception.
The Minister for the Death Bombing of Two Cisteren in September said "knowingly wrong", said the chief of the fractions of the Green Jürgen Trittin in the Saturday news show ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression, he lied.
The order for killing was issued in the absence of respect for the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the message that NATO had read by Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday it turned out that it was not only about the destruction of abducted trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
On an American raid, demanded by German commander Kunduzu, Colonel Klein, there was a murder or injury of up to 142 people, according to NATO's investigation.
Greens, SPD and Linke invited the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express herself immediately before the Common House and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan Social Chamber Policy - and, if the Office of Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, they invited Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from the Green Renate Künast.
The spokesman of Ulrich Wilhelm definitely refused criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there was also a voice of doubts about the Ministry’s view of the background of release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both of Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely about the background of the cistern attack.
Officially, it said that they were to deny the existence of NATO reports and shut the Minister's sensitive details.
However, from the vicinity of both top officials, it was noted that the Ministry of Defence even pointed out several reports, among them to a dual documentary commanding Colonel Klein and one report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should in the meantime request in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has yet received no answer.
The Ministry did not express itself on Saturday on issues and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Investigative Committee to the Federal Chamber, which will be established on the next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see paintings and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not just mentally ill, or drug-related, are bound between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and fantasies.
However, whoever experiences in the sense of dreams, sees and hears things that others do not see and do not hear, in today's western world usually pay for fool or drug addict or at least as a stranger.
However, such images and voices do not only occur in mentally ill or drug-related individuals.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neuron processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels here and there will take care of the boundaries between dreams, imagination and reality.
Dreams of altered consciousness may occur in different forms, in better case we call them visions, in worse errors.
Although the initiator and the effect may vary, the visions of mystery Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of Prophet New-Age Carlos Castanda, the shaman state of blushing, psychosis and hallucinations can be deducted from similar processes.
Halucinations or visions will arise if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters occurs - especially dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholin - and the interaction between the various parts of the brain is rushed.
Comprehensive hallucinations and misleading thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The philosophers and doctors have been employed between delusions and dreams.
Aristotles perceived hallucinations as a form of a dream in a conscious state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity of blooming with dreams", for Sigmunda Freuda was a dream of even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deceiving senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, climbing at the ceiling of the room.
He feels like a kick.
Behind him, winged black figures with bloody red grims, valuable teeth.
He's chasing him, kicking him with heavy fire shoes, throwing him on his wall, feeling pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices threaten from the wall and from the radio.
He can't stand the voices they're giving him and insulting.
Henning T. will pull two cables out of the stereo, put them in a loop and put it on the hook on the ceiling.
He's going up on one speaker, and he's got a loop around his neck.
Jumping.
The loop's on.
Teach, screaming in the congregation's voices tearing his drums, "Go to the clinic and get cured!"
Today, henning T. 40 years ago, he experienced six acute psychosis, last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD's been launched.
His diagnosis is schizoafect paranoid psychosis, except maniodepressive, taking medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his disease. He's married for three years.
I've had the worst fear and the deepest doubts in my psychosis, he says.
The spectacle is a terrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once per life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it's after depression of the second most frequently treated disease.
In the acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disabled can no longer distinguish the inner and external world, they get into a surviving state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or illusion of persecution.
The hearing of the votes is particularly widespread - the votes that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The temper is unable to distinguish important from the insignificant, the brain cannot filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, it opens the psychosis of the condition of flooding thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor Kliniki general psychiatry of the university clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizofrenik is located in the center of the event, everything is important to it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he becomes, like in a dream, congested events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenia therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible for them, visions are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Other than in a dream, Fuchss says, "but there remains a senseful and spatial structure of the fact that man perceives in psychosis, basically preserved."
The miserable thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the loss of experience takes place in real terms.
The scientist still stands in front of the puzzle, why exactly does our brain do such tricks.
The exceptional situation can lead to the short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
Not everyone's going to develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on those affected having minimal brain damage.
We believe that early stages of development will be damaged by the neuronal wound of the brain, such as the mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But she stays arguing about the failure of the neuron system, which has not shown anything during the years.
The roles also play the effects of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis if it is a disposition.
Also, halucinogen drugs can start psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains boil
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medicine, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a question of attitude.
Kasten has been gathering ten years of reports on hallucinations and delusions, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (Inreal world in our head).
Halucinations include typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as border personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer or brain trauma are often affected.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person itself.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the content of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or not suppressed; if our brain boils, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can start this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimules, stress, fear of love or other exceptional conditions.
In the newer studies, she gave up to a third of the questions that at least once in her life they had hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meclenburg-Dree Sealand and going to a higher gymnasium.
Actually, a totally normal girl.
If there weren't the images and the voices.
The breaks can happen that they'll call her collagnate with long, dark hair.
When he responds, the classmates are looking at her with a surprise-- no one can see and hear this boy except her.
This shy girl thinks of an uptight dream, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows.
He's awake, hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good. He likes the boy.
I'm crazy?
But he knows this boy and other delusions aren't real and he'll disappear again.
In the night, the apparitions are rather crumbling
Often, they're overwhelming.
When he sits in the class, he can't watch how many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains all the other equations clearly and clearly on the mathematical board.
In the night, the apparitions are rather crumbling.
When he's waiting in his dark room for sleeping, which comes often and too late, he can often distinguish whether he's awake or if he's asleep, whether the paintings that he sees, grimas, or the girl with bleeding cut wounds on his hands and legs arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't say anything about it. They'd think she's crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted Kasten's psychologist on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
The delusions are also arts of despair
If someone's socially isolated or being taken from his stimulus, he'll probably have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough jobs and he's taking care of his own fun.
Sarah K., the only child, was scared of other kids, often playing alone as a little girl.
Her hallucinations began when she found out that a man who's been calling Dad since she thought she was not her own father.
Because, in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas that also process real visions and sounds are difficult for disabled people like Sarah K., to distinguish from itself delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "the reality is also displayed in the brain.
The hallucinations are also images that let the brain create, so they act real."
Also, the night dreams evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not substantially different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Contrary to schizophrenics, people are mentally healthy capable of identifying their delusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The border state between sleep and hallucinations
In our focused world, unfortunately, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinic Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, severe illness, but also brings positive, creativity - the delusion is also art of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of changed consciousness to a dream.
Oneiroid status is highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the concerned considers real and can not even reverse them from the awakening condition.
Oneiroid condition of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full consciousness of motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps the lasting, complete incapacity of movement, he replaces life threatening the real situation of his own, the imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of border state between dream and hallucinations.
Since there is no way in reality to handle a situation, there will be a change in the worlds, but the real situation will turn itself into an idea.
Intensive form of promoting senses and transfer of senses in some unbearable situation that allows us to make people our own ability to form, to move into a loss of consciousness at a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also, historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experience in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart Machine) as a rescue event of the soul.
He was 49 years old after his heart valve surgery with his subsequent heart transplanted his consciousness on a several-day journey, while his body was still lying on an intense care unit.
Claussen was immersed in the world that he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man stuck on a bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot is guarding his health.
He lives in the early medieval age among the nobles that produce mutilation from blood.
On a motorcycle he takes the Greek to his country, surfs on a hospital bed in Alps and meets the Korean mafia.
It's totally diving into an imaginary history, everything's real, even later in memories.
These inner roads differ substantially from any dream.
The dream is a different condition, describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are clear after years and in substantive details.
Even clearer and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show the oneiroid status, psychosis, hallucinations and drug connections, as fragile as well as in the awakening state our internal images of the external reality.
Every change in consciousness, he summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to deformation of what we call reality."
The fact that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
At 27, they are supposed to take over the publishership of children
The new leader of Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand his business into the hands of both of his children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding's supposed to belong to a 100 percent family in the future.
Hamburg - Founder Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to enter the house, says a 69-year-old SPIEGEL man.
We discussed the details carefully.
The question is if they're also active in the company, it's counting until then.
And the question is if they have skills to do this.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in front of their children unless they are sufficiently capable.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he had been withdrawn from the Presidency of the Board since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of Burda's boarding office since 1999.
First he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury joined its responsibility for the property of the company and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also Direct Marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge of publishing.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son, Felix, who would have died today 42 years ago.
Calling Kallen also serves to "cross 10, 15," Burd.
Holding should belong to a 100 percent family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to Schickedanz and Schaeffler's cases, Burda expressed that even family businesses have no certainty before the disappearance: "It has always touched firms that have been infected by the desire of capital that speculated and thought that they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had dreams of world power, says Burd.
I don't feel like a political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these shops are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and it's a time when it's appropriate to find out what they wear, and to adapt to it your festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which is necessary to be aware.
We're putting in a few suggestions.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electromobile
Endesa's energy company, together with Barcelona's council, founded the 'LIVE Chancellor'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electromobile in the capital of Catalanska.
The LIVE's Office (Electronics Logistics) establishes and will guide the travel plan for the introduction of electromobiles in the city and ensure mobility agreements, will be dealt with, coordinating and providing contributions, etc.
It will also develop projectMOVELE, promote electromobiles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose of this means of transport is to support the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project for the introduction of electromobiles in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are three cities that the government has chosen within the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electromobiles.
Endesa’s energy company has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan Government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous region.
This also includes energy-related activities and, in particular, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa as regards the enforcement of electromobiles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the calm period in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector, is waiting for a "room period".
In the 2009 Government’s economic report, Zapatero summarized the measures that were implemented during the year in support of the automotive sector.
"Without the Competition Plan for the automotive sector, we would be expected to be abandoned today, the closure of some of our main production companies," said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks for this plan and wish to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace for this industry, which is our main export sector," added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which is part of the Integral Car Plan (PIA), identified 800 million for projects of 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised the investment of more than 3 billion Eur.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government’s support measures and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the President's statement, this plan allowed to reduce by 6% of the average emissions for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensure a significant increase in the entries, namely by "40%" in November.
20.000 square meters of classical vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Chamber of Classic Vehicles will be opened, which is a space for the meeting of professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on 5 and 7 February 2010 in the madridské Casa de Campo Glass Palace.

Mazda3 i-Stop: maintenance of sports style
Mazda intends to show that spareness to the surrounding environment has no negative influence on sports style.
Therefore, Mazda3 also has an integrated engine stop and start system - baptized as well as ai-Stop-, which is a device that is currently available only with a gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, vehicle design, population, behavior, mechanics, system i-Stop...
All these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats incl. the driver's seats have excellent ergonomia and are excellently assimilated.
The wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using the tool and console sets, we will conclude that Mazda continues in the Japanese tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a significant red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style that also presents Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sobriety of German products and specifically even more with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large luggage area and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and engine start system is available for the time being only with a fuel engine of two litres and 150 horse forces and ashes hand transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterizes a reduced level of noise, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in diesel version, all those who do not ride so many kilometres per year should not rule out this i-Stop with petrol engine, because it is more comfortable in driving and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes more serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is essential to mention the monitoring system of the lanes (RVM), which prevents the emergence of a dead angle, towing and stability control, speed control, inner mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor,bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels from 17-inch alloys.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for a surcharge of EUR 1.500: adaptable lights of twoxenon and the sound system of the BOSE with a CD holder, except for other parts.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of your category.
It is mainly characterised by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not pick more miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with gasoline engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantages of this model is the higher price of EUR 21.770 for Luxury and € 23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxurious Prime Minister
L.A. has a red carpet, gentle as Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie's hands.
Stars have glowed more than ever in new elegant and sexy brand'Nine' models. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lads'.
Promise FonPeek
The peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view the mail, without a possibility to view a certain type of attachments or surf over the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States when Time magazine appreciated him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him out is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by very low prices and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanent free data service, for which it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
FonPeek, which was introduced yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of invention and its third transformation.
It is limited as well as his American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is around EUR 12 per month and covers roaming across Europe.
Passengers with smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after border crossing or impatiently looking for a WiFi café (or Fon connection) to see the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, you would need a Physics Physics doctorate to understand them, and also very good glasses to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission constantly calls for a reduction in roaming tariffs to be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no expected effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such an instrument like FonPeek (is interesting that it continues to have the name Fon if it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff, means that operators start to think differently and consider different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering a download of books and other online search.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is applicable for purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen in the case of FonPeek, it's the possibility of buying a permanent approach like Peek has already been established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it, because I think it's the best type in terms of consumers.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on the computer.
The color Michelle loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For the arrival of Barack Obama to the U.S. President's office, she chose the dress and coat in this color, she also chose the same color when she was accompanying him at the second most important moment of his life: giving Nobel the price of peace in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow green with shiny effects-, in both cases it was a three-dimensional set - dress, bag and coat from the same substance- decorated with a large height or collar.
At first sight, the first lady of the USA decided to follow the footsteps of an asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
She used a large lace in Oslo's velvet with a print on the opportunity to enter Michelle's function.
Changes also supplements: green shoes with medium high heel, now similar model, but in golden color.
They wear different hairdryers: this time the dirt, the previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have problems with maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased over the past few years, especially in women of younger years who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study "Ploodiness and working career of Spanish women" performed by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
9,737 females aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market for maternity.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in the opinion of the number of children depending on whether they work or not, as well as by type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their homes work on part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth to the first child and have more children in general.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner association and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with a stable job have the first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of their partnership with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who were given their stable employment to a greater part of their life and therefore had to postpone the partnership of children's coming.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on maternity, although less influence on the time of commencement with a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, which is involved in research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting women's age at the time of marriage and childbirth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education is, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
The differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49, women were born with primary and higher education their first child aged 25,1 or 32,1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with primary education get married and give birth to the first child before they find stable jobs, while women with medium or high education opposedly prefer to obtain stable jobs, before marriage and birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, German actress becomes the face of various products of this brand under the universal password 'Because I am worth it'.
Director 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most illicit actors of international level, is thus added to another famous personalityL'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope Cruz.
Before her, they entered the selected team by Evangeline Lilly ('Ztracen') and Freida Pinto ('Milionary from the chatter').
The male part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in the Losts).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to talk about fashion.
Their most important leaders - designers and models, earlier and present - have gathered at the annual delivery of prices in London, on the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing in the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicenta Poker
Manuel Vicent presents 30 X-ray images of writers with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in normal life).
They do not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but they seek something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The road brings thrills, and Vicent does not spare cures or inspirations.
This book is an excellent reader's pleasure, even during repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
Albert Camus: "On the site of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not sea, but spiritual impulse, almost physical, as I feel, but it cannot be named: the pleasure of the anti-destiny, the morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "The Naihilist, the allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own naturality and not intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, no sense, as if it was the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been dedicated to passion to this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, a spiritual privilege to achieve the heavens by the way of damnation."
James Joyce: "This Odyssea released in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eighty thousand peaks in the universal literature, which must be overcome from the north from which the best mountain climbers will often fall."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange person.
He himself, said he was the heir of the county statue, another time he was the son of a black girl with a crocodile.
In both cases it was the great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught a deranged cry of this man from Munich on the bridge to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running from himself and crying to the future and speaking sharply to worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "Only she cried and prayed, 'God, my beloved, make me stop writing as a woman."
Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verse was drawn on his grave: 'After the effort there will be a dream,/ after the storm of a quiet port,/after the war of rest,/after a full life death."
Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also took his depression.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was watching her between the azalks or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What else was Martín Santos going on than targeting Joyce on Baroy?
What else was the matter with Benet than let Baroja execute Faulkner's gun?
What else was it for Celo than to make the famous at the expense of the glory of this man?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother passed through our quarters, in the Fuenlabrad County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by the surroundings and our dog, the crossword saved from the shelter of a weight of up to six kilograms, without a single word kicked him twice and severely wounded him.
Our arrogance is the greater that we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal, which was on the lead.
And to this, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she was on a walk with these individuals, she began to fear for her own safety, because such a devil obsessed man who attacks the animal, is able to do the same thing as a woman, a child, an old person, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, usually a quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we lodged a complaint on the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was something, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly killers were Spanish nationality.
Enragement has made us announce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youths when they're having fun with a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where proper education, respect for animals and people have been.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
A manufacturer of Michelin tyres in cooperation with Spain, the transport security Foundation (Fesvial) has launched a helmet support campaign, especially with younger motorists, as both have been informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injury, if possible, deaths in the event of an accident on a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport security obligations, which means more than suggesting and making even more secure products, and has confirmed that it is attempting to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. by means of an instructive and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of the helmet on a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 motorcycles are repaired will be deployed to get to the widest public awareness.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport security "is a constant problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to constantly increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
Nearly after two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase by 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, it was the first increase after 22 months of permanent collapse, according to the figures of the patronage organisation of the manufacturers of Anfac and dealers of Ganvam.
However, the positive figure is better to put in quarantine, since November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and meant 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
The result is that, notwithstanding the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, it has been sold95.853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick ups, deliveries, smaller cars and light trucks/cars.
And not even clouds that are most damaged by demand, although they were bought by private persons, most of the purchases were carried out by smaller and medium-sized companies and in 100% cases are financed by third parties.
In order to reduce the closure of bank loans, further factors such as stopping or continuing to mislead the economic situation should be added.
In that situation, unlike passenger cars, the aid for 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the persons taking part in the business list of small and medium-sized companies which intend to purchase a light-use vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again reminded that special attention should be paid to the administration of these vehicles as well as industrial cars (camas and buses).
The association of sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the calculations of sales in passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the hand brake is already a compulsory equipment.
As in the case of an ABS-blocking system, it will also be the ESP stability management, assisted hand brake systems, all of this will become the compulsory equipment of European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the compulsory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the time limit for the removal of deficiency is set for others, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, with the effect that it can help prevent many reductions.
The hand brake auxiliary system increases the brake pressure in the emergency case, which the system finds out when the driver gets caught.
But not always can keep this pressure until the end.
According to a study performed by the manufacturer of Bosch car parts, a third of the drivers who have an accident did not have a brake before the crash and half of them did not use the brake power.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the maximum braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to the study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal accidents could be avoided annually related to walkers.
The reduction of this number would be even more marking-for calculations to prevent one of the four accidents with an impact on the persons-after the introduction of the so-called smart hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (aiding radar or camera) captures obstacles and report them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, he will help increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will intensify the brake as much as possible and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors delays the plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will be launched in the first week of April - probably 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American producer notes that to meet the Opel recovery plan will need more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be first submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that Saab's sales decisions should be taken on these days.
No wonder the Swedish government increased the pressure on the American producer to take certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM allows contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to get Volvo, but he is considering the possibility of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports vehicles, which operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg Group.
In the absence of an agreement with any of them, the GM could sell some of the assets of Saab of Baic China.
On the other hand, the decision to close the end of the year unless its sale is available.
Drive with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, therefore the weight shows only1.275 kg.
Based on, in the first place, an automatic download roof is in a hand-made operation, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; further used aluminum doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a weight reduction of 7 kg; after mounting the sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to a 19-inch round five pounds.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audiosystem means another six pounds less and the replacement of the door handles by textile captures means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-speed PDK transmission, one vehicle was tested with a hand-made six-speed speed cabinet, mainly on the second-class roads in California, in the mountains with many folded corners.
His behavior can only be qualified as intact.
Mass reduction does not mean the vehicle does not print to asphalt.
More like the opposite: we haven't tested this small and light model for a long time, which would also transfer such safety in the turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of warming muscles on a short drive for the necessary time until we get him sprint, braking, and renewing the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the drive that's so communicative as accurate, whatever we suggest with our hands on the wheel, it's what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
The sound of the engine by will
Sound V6 boxer, about 320 horses (more than Boxster S) is very cooked and it is possible to strengthen the possibility of 'sport' and through a system that modifys the sound of the engine, which has already been used in Panamery.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in suction or recurrence.
The trailers are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The Asfalt Roads we've been going through with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car has done well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride, while we encountered during the lightning and the jaw even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the most entertaining on the market, because it's a little more than just Boxster S modification.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of €70.831.
'Bag Girl'
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, the Coco Cocoon series icon and occasional 'starlette' on the 'firma' shows her face as bad girl as well as Chanel's purse.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia has given her victory in Israel
The worker’s post has acquired a brilliant victory in 82-91 in its hosting at the complicated field Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous abstentions in Duska Ivanovice’s team, and thus he reached the head of his group after the great performance Mirzy Teletovice, which with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 ratings).
Vitorie’s cooperative was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase or Mic’s great dose of deployment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great accuracy of the 16 triite points was a lot involved in the final triumph.
The fight started with a front for the blue, who were standing on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already suggested that they attacked Israeli cooperatives very hard.
English and Teletovic belonged among the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team decided for the inner game of Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, which was accepted by sanding and clamping when returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the beginning of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although no six' evaluation of Splitter has already indicated that it will not be the best night for Brazil.
But although the game was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the smallest and the Macabeans wanted to remind Vitoria that everyone on their field won't win, and 'the Elíase' was able to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to returning to the Eidson (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured, but not dead at all, needed a few exact games to take the breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic gun appeared, which three three tripled almost each other and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavians settled the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to prepare for the earned results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their manhood, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite that, and with Splitter excluded for the faul, the selvanovice did not hesitate and defended well, and although the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already had a winner and the Aviv lost for the first time for the season.
Injuries make Unicaja impossible to fight
Unicaja has lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left the leadership of the group B in Euroliza in the match, which was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly by the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga’s cooperatives were not afraid of the surroundings of the Pavilion of peace and friendship, or the rival, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusan to dream. Aggressive defense and three three points at each other, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, the playground s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofUnicaja , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Unclecic and Schortsanitis, he turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the fight between resistances from the USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team started working and showed its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English beer due to Joe Freeland's injury and three personal errors Carlos Jiménez had burdened the Unicaja team
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing of Linase Kleizas with triple points, they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible Retaliation
The third part was very attacking by the Olympiacos, who, although losing 19, showed the superiority and even managed to settle the difference from the match in Malaze Málaga 66-48, a minute 27, which shattered by leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish beetle Robert Archibald, who was injured during the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the leadership and three-points of Cook and the benefit of Lewis, she left a certain hope n of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos, thanks to strengthening and transfer in the centimeters in his zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatia's beer Nikola Vujcic, was able to compensate the average 81-62, a minute 37, and Unicaja swabed and handed over the lead of Olympiacos.
How much do you have to do for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can meet a payment that deserves for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit application, search engines with the largest number of classed adverts from the area of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool how much should you take? calculate user salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 jobs available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you need to enter a profession, years of experience, age and city where you wish to work.
During the week, what the application works, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally feels badly rewarded, explains in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data available by Trovit from its search engines in Great Britain and France, the Spanish are the worst payment.
The British programmer takes EUR 45.226 gross per year and French 31.059 while Spain receives 24.000.
The driver also pays EUR 34.247 per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work of a waiter with EUR 11.592 per year is in Spain; the salesman is followed by EUR 14.725 and a worker with EUR 15.667.
The most sought employment on the network in the last three months is a driver, a half-time job and a social worker.
Brazil fixed the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government fixed the time limit for Manuel Zelay on its ambassador in Tegucigalpa.
The appointed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010 when his mandate is officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ́affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Dutch capital, confirmed for the Globo TV that "Mel" knows that he has to leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since 21 September.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former stateman who confirmed his intention to leave the Embassy before the time set: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," said Zelay on the phone.
After the elections of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he continued on the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
Eventually, the operation has failed because Zelaya has rejected the condition of political asylum, which he was trying to put down by the government "de facto", chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and rose since last spring, when asset inflation represented a supervising mood in the markets, there was again uncertainty in the markets, which should not be surprising because it is already a natural situation in the environment where the negotiators take decisions on the future that is unsured for themselves.
The drug used by central banks for the stabilisation of the market was direct debt by buying assets and indirect release of liquidity in a nearest zero course so that financial institutions can purchase assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually ceased, and without questioning their disproportionate liquidity policy, they will start throwing a little sand into the souvenir, as the Spanish Central Bank has done with its auction last year.
Therefore, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodexive measures, and we participate in the return of risk revenue reductions.
The movement of the stock exchange and the differences in bonds of society have regained points, although they are still very distantly unormous levels achieved at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialize private risk, which has again affected public debt.
Again, they are pushing on quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become a refuge for selected investors, thereby expanding the differentiation of the euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost affected by this instability, but at that time came Standard & Poor's and threatened to a new revision of the reduction of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not unnecessary for the silence of advocates of moral risk, who attempted to again burden the conscience of the persons responsible for the global economic policy due to the misleading of the destructive consequences of restricting the employment loan when a new day of thanksgiving should be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs of renewal of power in the Emirates, and with regard to Greece, we have seen this before.
The government that covers deficit, elections, and the new government begins.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin would save Hungary from failing to pay foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member States not to fulfil their obligations.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin will force the Greek government to ensure transparency and commitment of its own citizens to joint responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are found before the period of standardisation of the premium from a transitional risk, some excesses on supported positions would be expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were reduced and ours would continue to expand, it would be typically a Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the services of studies to accept their scenarios of renewal and revising their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not know a great hope for the Spanish economy to fulfil this warning.
Again, it looks like it's gonna be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "supervisor, driver's friend".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene before the subcommittee of the Chamber, where in those days the energy strategy of Spain is being discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention followed by the speech by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán provided a few remarks on the proposal submitted by the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol Spain, EUR 50,000 million needs investment by 2020 and another 60,000 million from this date to 2030 if nuclear power plants currently operate.
If this had not happened, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola really believes that investment must focus in the next decade not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections
Since 2020, the question has changed and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer is concentrated on gas plants and coal power plants with mechanisms to capture carbon dioxide and, in particular, renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that the new 18,000 MW needs, but with other "conservative energy".
The Galan, who believes that the proposal of the Act on Sustainable Economy, which has just approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the company has requested, did not want to leave a living as a royal decree to promote national coal consumption, which opposes the policy of combating climate change.
According to his opinion, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "precision" measure, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever this is, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, have to start taking now, because their ageing lasts and a stable tax framework is required to start it.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
Daughter company Ferrovial for airport ground services, Swissport company, will play the role of the preferential partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cost services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belong to the most important of them.
The Agreement, which has not yet expired, shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and University of Alcalá de Henares, yesterday signed a cooperation protocol to the establishment of the Centre for Innovation of Smart Infrastructures
The association foresees an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be researching energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona is looking for his first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, which is the market where he already works as a energy and water-efficiency.
The construction is estimated at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about EUR 1.047 million).
Her opponents are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The long tunnel in Brisbane's Australian city in the east coast has become the closest possible option for Accciona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway business.
City Hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP by initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan founded by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach EUR 1.700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and at the last stage competitions with a significant presence in European buildings.
The group called Transcity leads Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, and the second with its headquarters in Italy is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
The Acciona Group is in the game of the Northern Direct company with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield infrastructure manager and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last company that passed the network has the name LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (the company of Hochtief, here represented by the ACS), also local Baulderstone (the ownership of the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major company specialized in the civil constructions of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction and privatisation, but it bears a clear difficulty in entering other than the acquisition of local construction companies.
The strategy, followed by the above mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector, except for Asian references.
ACS has acquired its position on the market through its 30 % share in Hochtief, the owner of the Leighton quoted company.
Million assets
Acciona bets on a geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities of the energy supplier and in the desolation store.
In addition to other assets, the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria has a group of companies that build and manage discharge facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy for entry into the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground road subject to the toll whose promoter is the Office for Brisbane infrastructure, called Northern Link (Several Link), has to connect the western highway from Toowong with the occupancy route in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 kilometres of the tunnel. This is the largest event for reducing Brisbane traffic overload.
The calendar established by the local administration plans for the summer of 2010 and the launch of the work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would be opened in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began designing in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract Hochtief
Australia still brings Hochtief a significant profit, since yesterday she announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The share ACS will operate through its local pillar of Leighton infrastructure of the national network of the broad band with optical fibre cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet to 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German society for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the tower project King George on 27 floors in the Australian Brisbane city. The construction work had only begun and Hochtief closed sale for 129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, he will participate in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years with Laing O'Rourke.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC through its Alpine pillar has acquired the allocation of the tunnel construction of 2.1 kilometers for the highway in Slovenia worth EUR 64.5 million.
The company received a contract for a few days after the work to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens his experience in the construction of tunnels.
The opening of the work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the implementation period is 32 months.

Penalty of 63 million forFrance Télécom for the braking of competition
The Competition Authority in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million for IFrance Télécom for counter-competitive behaviour in Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers at the border of regulation.
This sanction was a former French monopoly and the state society has still purchased more than EUR 560 million since 1994 for impeding obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased since the Authority, which supervises competition, believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and has therefore been reciprocal.
Apps trade
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star between other operators and opened an internet-based business with a view to increasing revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, Orange will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for access to other countries such as Spain.
Play Champions League brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barçe
The League of Masters has become a source of income for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
Until then, Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million, which makes them the third and fifth most earning club in the competition.
The Charter leads Manchester United.
The Charter leads Manchester United.
To win the League of EUFA masters does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
Up to the extent that the competition divided EUR 5,62.5 million between 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) which took part in this event since the tournament was formed in the 1992/1993 season, according to the EUFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he won for participation, and the only one with AC Milan, who won three times the main prize.
The Catalan present champion and the final winner of the deceased Cup of Europe in 1992 is the fifth in classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two cooperatives who also charged the most money for attending the past Liza masters.
And yet she's both lost with Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is up to a third country that has obtained the most money through the Champions, although it has obtained the most titles of all (first against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by a complicated procedure for the distribution of the money that the EUFA uses.
For this financial year, the institution chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1.090 million for the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA has paid EUR 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that have participated in the pre-classification wheel (within other Atlético Madrid) has received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have gained participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, except for another €550,000 for each match they participated.
There are also bonuses for winning (800.000 euros) and for remission (400.000 for each team). Osmiphinalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
Champion earns 9 million while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
Thus, the club earns at least 7.1 million and up to 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super cup in August.
In addition, there are moving payments to which 337.8 million are determined.
These money shall be divided by the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the mains and has four admissible places.
The champion of last year gets 40% of the money allocated, second 30%, third20% and fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid by the number of matches that will be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29,9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday details of the buying-in offer of shares with which it wishes to obtain a top place between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not undertake to make a public offer for the acquisition of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share that would be paid in ten years and for which the interest would be paid for this deferral1% per year.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended trading at EUR 1.85; therefore, the Nueva Rumasa offer evaluates the company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to notify their interest in selling shares.
The CNMV declared that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that he had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would be 611.7 million, while Sos capitalization is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, the soap continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to continue at the edge of the possible offers to buy and compensate for the courts of his former leaders, Jesús' brothers and Jaime Salazars, María Luisa's election was announced as Head of the Internal Audit.
This Decision makes it the first woman who has acquired a high function in the food business.
This is a newly created place that will be subjected directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the field because the company is still immersed in the legal battle for a alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos company of the Salazar brothers.
In fact, the possibility that the next months of Sos will reveal new transitions of the funds is impossible.
As regards Salazar's credit, former members of the Ildefonso Ortega Council and Ágel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja last night) were held at the National Court and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows Paterna to be excluded from Inversora Mer
Last night, the National Committee on the Market for Securities (CNMV) authorised the exclusion attended by Inversor Mer against Federic Paternin on October 9th.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions are consistent with the applicable standards and believes that the "sufficient" content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced by 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer is aimed at obtaining 5550.008 shares of Federica Paterna at EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the capital of the company formed by 6.142.786 shares admitted to trade in Madrid and Bilbau.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares have been displaced, which will not be able to be transferred in any way until the offer has been concluded which it specified that the price was determined by the Paternina Federation in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New car valuation instruments
In these days, storms and accidents make not only auto-services.
Each day, thousands of cars suffered from a insurance event are dragged to a service where the expert has to estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the working time can be a long and complex work.
Compute manually the repair costs from EUR 20,000 to EUR 30,000 including parts and workforce may take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools it would be a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% experts use this kind of system.
Services providers and solutions to estimate insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American Solera Group is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the valuation and development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by producers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, the commercial director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provide them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing continues to grow since more versions, variants and engine solutions have been reported in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is a very hot job because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle needs to be catalogued and determined by its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is performed, where individual parts of tourist cars can be "includes".
With regard to the model with mass sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to the minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the traffic park in circulation, it exceeds 99%.
Audatex has eight centres divided across the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in particular brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There is more than a hundred techniques (normally mechanics) working with three screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data shall be included each month and customers shall be updated every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information enables companies to use and provide different products.
The most frequent uses are concentrated on repair and maintenance, but according to country, there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide available to inform about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain the aid that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for the award of insurance events intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for repair as estimated by the manufacturer or by the lacquer.
This instrument shall be applicable by application for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it fewer than ten times a month.
Afterwards, any insurance undertaking carrying out thousands of estimates shall negotiate its prize with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came from the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of the chassis.
AudaGlass is focused on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows you to exclude vehicles with a total insurance event.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying the trend, performing geodemographic analysis or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model-determined brands have passed by service due to a crash or how many serious insurance events have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that focuses on the development of this type of instruments.
Among other things, Gt Estimate sells, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and the official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is the company of Einsa founded in 1971 as a service provider and management of the assessment of damages, accidents or maintenance of cars
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24.000 users in service, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover volume increased by 20% per year over the last three years and charged EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internation started by the installation of the office in Paris.
Audatex was established in Germany in 1966 and was employed in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of 62% of her brother is created in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33.000 services, of which 3.000 in Spain.
The World Invoicing of Soler Group (Audatex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) reaches $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Soler's group was worth $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated to be $4,400 million.
Since 2007 it has been registered for a new york stock exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an Internet base for sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after insurance events.
The operation assumed payment of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended by the remaining 15% in the next year.
The objective of buying was to provide more services with added value to customers with the possibility of access to the huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance, experts, leases, services, sales of spare parts and professional dealers who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650.000 operations across Europe, from which 500.000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are excellent among the main markets.
The Web currently has over 1,500 registered salesmen and 4.000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisers and adds about 100 new advertisements every day on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish law, the car number of the chassis has been removed cannot return to operation but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be authorised to operate, although they have been shut down, after a preliminary procedure.
Budget service in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user will receive the budget only in four steps: vehicle identification, search for the spare part, budget creation and budget generation.
The ease of use is a crucial condition for these systems, especially for the belief of professionals at a higher age, who are more or less resilient in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 trucks and 44 trucks.
Naturally for use, a computer with Internet connection is needed.
After identification of the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model will appear and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user may include variables as a cost of work force, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument for valuation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that it is oriented to the service and does not include an estimate of workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year which the customer can finance.
At the moment, Audatex is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanics welcome, because it will allow for example to choose the door and turn them around to display the internal side.
